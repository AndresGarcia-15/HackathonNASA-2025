          "Study Protocol Description": "Sample Return and De-Integration: Before return on SpaceX-9 (8/29/16), all BRIC canisters were transferred to -32 C cold bags and maintained at this temperature until arrival at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). At KSC, BRIC-PDFUs were de-integrated and the Petri dishes containing experimental samples were then removed and stored at -80 C. Note: Ground control (GC2) experiment was repeated due to low CFU recovery from the original ground control experiment. Repeated samples followed the same procedures using identical hardware and ISS environmental conditions as stated above. All the samples sent out for omics analyses were from GC2 experiment. Petri dishes containing the samples, kept at -80 C, were transferred from KSC to ARC GeneLab Sample Processing Lab.     BRIC-23 utilized four Biological Research In Canisters Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs) -- two were prepared with flight samples, while two were prepared with ground control samples. The four BRIC-PDFUs included five 60 mm Petri dishes (10 flight, 10 ground control). For Staphylococcus aureus: 1x10^7 S. aureus cells (strain UAMS-1) were air dried onto 20 Petri dishes (10 flight, 10 ground control). Flight samples were delivered to the ISS on SpaceX-9 which launched 7/18/16. Once aboard the ISS, growth of both microbes was initiated by the addition of 8.5 mL of TSY-Glycerol media (10% glycerol (v/v), 1.7% (w/v) tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) NaCl, 0.3% soytone, 0.3% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.25% (w/v) K2HPO4, 0.25% (w/v) glucose). S. aureus samples were grown for 48 hours, at 20-30 C without agitation before growth was terminated by transferring the BRIC-PDFUs to -80 C. Matched ground controls followed the same procedures using identical hardware with the same ISS environmental conditions that the flight samples were exposed to.     Filter-sterilized and concentrated (5 kDa MW cutoff) BRIC-23 supernatants were provided by NASA’s Life Science Data Archive (LSDA) (5 samples each of BRIC-23 FLT and GC samples). Proteins from a 480-610 µl volume of each sample were precipitated by adding 120-150 µL of 100% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid to each sample, followed by incubation for 30 minutes at 4°C. Samples were centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 5 minutes, then the supernatant was discarded. Protein pellets were washed with 200 µL of cold acetone, then samples were centrifuged again as above, and the acetone wash was repeated for a total of two washes. Protein pellets were dried by leaving tubes open in the sterile biosafety cabinet for 5 minutes to allow acetone to evaporate. Next, pellets were resuspended in 200 µL of urea buffer (6 M urea, 0.4 M Tris, pH 7.8) and stored at -20°C. Protein concentrations were measured via Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit, Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein (10.59 µg per sample) were used, and three replicates per sample type were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The entire lane per sample was excised with a scalpel and diced into 1 mm^2 cubes. In-gel trypsin digestion was performed as previously described.     Protein identification and quantification were performed using a label-free quantitative shotgun mass proteomics approach using an HPLC-Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (UF-ICBR proteomics core). Briefly, the peptide samples were analyzed using a 250-mm Ultrahigh-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) system coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The Thermo EASY nano-LC system was used for liquid chromatography, employing a 20-mm C16 pre-column (Thermo Scientific) to remove impurities. A reversed-phase C18 analytical column with a 100Å pore (Thermo Scientific, Acclaim PepMap 100 C18 LC Column) was used for sample separation. The following solvents were used for chromatography: solvent A (0.1% formic acid), solvent B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) with a 2-40% solvent B acetonitrile gradient for 105 minutes, followed by a 14-minute wash with 98% solvent B, and equilibration with 2% solvent A. The LC system was directly interfaced with the Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer. The Orbitrap detector acquired MS data at 120K resolution with a scan range of 350-2000 m/z. For MS/MS analysis, ions were isolated by a quadrupole, prioritizing the most intense ions, and ions for all available parallelizable times were injected. Precursor ions were then excluded for 36 seconds. Fragmentation was performed using collision-induced dissociation (CID) at a collision energy of 35% and an activation time of 10 ms.",

          "Study Description": "Staphylococcus aureus colonizes the nares of approximately 30% of humans, a risk factor for opportunistic infections. Because of the potential threat of S. aureus to astronaut health, the effect of spaceflight conditions on this pathogen is of great interest. To gain insight into the virulence potential of S. aureus in the spaceflight environment, we performed differential expression (DE) analysis of RNA-Seq and cellular proteomics data from the “Biological Research in Canisters-23” (BRIC-23) GeneLab spaceflight experiment, a mission designed to measure the response of S. aureus to growth in low earth orbit (LEO) on the international space station (ISS). This experiment used Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs) to grow asynchronous ground controls (GCs) and spaceflight cultures of S. aureus for 48 hours. Analysis of the RNA-Seq data revealed that RNAIII, the effector of the Accessory Gene Regulator (Agr) quorum sensing system, was the most highly upregulated gene in spaceflight cultures (~88-fold) relative to GCs. Genes of the agr operon (~14 fold) were also highly upregulated during spaceflight, followed by genes encoding secreted phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) and secreted proteases, all of which are positively regulated by Agr. Upregulated spaceflight genes/proteins also had functions related to urease activity, Ess secretion, and copper transport. We also performed a secretome analysis of culture supernatant samples from BRIC-23. In line with the other BRIC-23 omics data, spaceflight supernatants displayed significantly increased abundance of several known secreted virulence factors, including Agr-regulated proteases (SspA, SspB), staphylococcal nuclease (Nuc), and EsxA, a small protein secreted by the type VII-like Ess secretion system. These data also suggested that S. aureus metabolism is altered in space flight conditions relative to the ground controls (increased amino acid metabolism, TCA cycle and PTS systems, and decreased glycolysis/fermentation and translation machinery). Collectively, these data suggest that S. aureus experiences increased quorum sensing and altered expression of virulence factors in response to the spaceflight environment that may impact its pathogenic potential.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "At the end of incubation, the third chamber was introduced to fix (PFA) the samples in microgravity, and samples were transferred to 4 °C until unberthing. Fixed and preserved samples then returned to Earth at 4 °C. Once on Earth, samples were stored at 4 °C until sample processing. Ground samples were performed asynchronously, activating and terminating two hours later to replicate the order of flight procedures. The temperature profile of spaceflight samples was also reproduced for the ground samples. When spaceflight samples returned to Earth, all coupons (both flight and ground) were recovered from the FPAs and processed for morphology analysis.     A total of 144 samples were prepared, 72 for flight and 72 for corresponding ground controls. All coupons were prepared in the same fashion. Each gravitational condition tested six material surfaces (SS316, pSS316, LIS, cellulose membrane, silicone, and silicone DLIP), three biofilm incubation times (1, 2, or 3 days), and two termination reagents (PFA for morphology analysis and RNAlater for transcriptomics) with four replicates per condition. This OSDR study presents the morphology data. Flight samples were sent to the ISS on the Cygnus NG-12 spacecraft. Double-sided tape (3M, Cat. 9731) was placed on the backside of the coupons to adhere them onto the inserts. Adhered coupons on inserts were installed in the FPAs and autoclaved. FPAs were loaded with 2.75 ml of sterile 1.18X LBK and the first chamber was closed with a second insert. The use of solid inserts prevents gas exchange and forces anaerobic growth of P. aeruginosa. The first chamber was incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours as a contamination check. Afterwards, the second chamber was loaded with 0.5ml of the PA14 inoculum in stasis and closed with a rubber septum. The third and last chamber was filled with 1.75 ml of PFA and closed with a rubber septum. Eight FPAs with the three-chamber configuration were assembled into each GAP and transferred to 4 °C. Spaceflight samples were launched in stasis (in PBS and at 4°C) to the ISS to avoid bacterial growth before microgravity conditions were achieved. Once in microgravity, astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch activated the spaceflight samples by combining the first and second chambers of the FPAs, which introduced the inoculum into the culture media. Samples were incubated at 37°C inside BioServe’s Space Automated Bioproduct Lab (SABL) for the designated incubation times (1, 2, or 3 days) in anaerobic conditions. At the end of incubation, the third chamber was introduced to fix (PFA) or preserve (RNAlater) the samples in microgravity, and samples were transferred to 4 °C or -80 °C, respectively, until unberthing.     The Nikon SIM/A1 Laser scanning Confocal Microscope (inverted) of CU Boulder Light Microcopy Core Facility was used to take four 125x125μm Z-stacks (30-40 slices with step size ranging from 0.1-1.5μm, average 0.5μm) per coupon, aligning the four fields of view to the center of the coupon.     The stained samples were mounted onto glass slides; gorilla glue was used to adhere the coupon to the slide and the biofilm on top was covered with one drop of VectaShield HardSetTM Antifade Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories, Cat. H-1400-10) and a coverslip. Mounted samples were stored at 4 °C for 20 hours protected from light prior to imaging, this allowed the mounting medium and glue to harden in order to avoid smearing the biofilm while imaging. Samples were imaged in groups of 4 per session (spaceflight samples with their corresponding ground controls in the same session).     To eliminate the planktonic cells, the coupons fixed in PFA were washed three times with 1 mL of PBS which was slowly poured on the walls of the wells to avoid disturbing the biofilm. The samples were stained with PI [15 μM] (PromoKine Cat. PK-CA707-40017 diluted with water) for 15 min and with FilmTracerTM FMTM 1-43 Green Biofilm [10 μg/ml] (Invitrogen Cat. F10317 diluted with DMSO and water as per manufacturer’s instructions) for 30 min under light-protected conditions. After each stain the samples were washed with 1 ml of PBS. Immediately after the wash, the PBS was removed for mounting.     Immediately after the wash, the PBS was removed and the stained samples were mounted onto glass slides; gorilla glue was used to adhere the coupon to the slide and the biofilm on top was covered with one drop of VectaShield HardSe Antifade Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories, Cat. H-1400-10) and a coverslip. Mounted samples were stored at 4C for 20 hours protected from light prior to imaging, this allowed the mounting medium and glue to harden in order to avoid smearing the biofilm while imaging. Samples were imaged in groups of 4 per session (spaceflight samples with their corresponding ground controls in the same session).\n\nThe biofilms were imaged with 100X SR Apo immersion oil objective (NA equals 1.49 WD equals 120µm), using lasers 488 nm (green, emission filter 500-550 nm) and 561nm (red, emission filter 575-625 nm). All images were acquired with 1.2 pinhole, laser power range (green and red equals 0.1 to 2.3), offset range (green equals -48 to 4, and red equals -45 to 6), and PMT HV range (green equals 3.0 to 86, red equals 2.0 to 82) using the NIS Elements software. Images were taken with laser powers that avoided photobleaching and HV sensitivity settings that maximized the dynamic range without saturation. Resulting biofilm images were pseudo-colored with red (PI, nucleic acids) and green (Green Biofilm, lipids) for display with a linear LUT covering the full range of the data. Raw image files were used for quantitative analysis. First, Image J was used to merge both fluorescent channels and convert files from nd2 to tiff format. Then, the “Slice Remover” plugin was used to eliminate the slices with no biofilm signal from each Z-stack. The “Convert to OME-Tiff” macro was used to generate compatible files for analysis with the publicly available COMSTAT2 software90–92. COMSTAT2 calculated biofilm mass (µm3/µm2), thickness (µm), and surface area coverage (%) of the biofilms with automatic thresholding.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of the tabular dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.",

          "Study Description": "Microorganisms' natural ability to live as organized multicellular communities – also known as biofilms – provides them with unique survival advantages. For instance, biofilms are protected against environmental stresses thanks to their extracellular matrix, which could contribute to persistent infections after treatment. Biofilms are also capable of strongly attaching to surfaces, where their metabolism byproducts could lead to surface material degradation. Furthermore, microgravity can alter biofilm behavior in unexpected ways, making the presence of biofilms in space a risk for both astronauts and spaceflight hardware. Despite the efforts to eliminate microorganism contamination from spacecrafts surfaces, it is impossible to prevent human-associated bacteria or fugus from eventually establishing biofilm surface colonization. Nevertheless, by understanding the changes that biofilms undergo in microgravity, it is possible to identify key differences and pathways that could be targeted to significantly reduce biofilm formation. The Space Biofilms project, performed at the International Space Station, contributes to such understanding by characterizing the morphology and gene expression of bacterial and fungal biofilms formed in microgravity with respect to ground controls. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was used as model organism for the bacterial morphology and transcriptomic studies, while Penicillium rubens was used for the fungal morphology study. The data presented on this study page represent the morphology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa using the confocal microscopy assay.",

This strain was selected for the project to replicate the column-and-canopy biofilm structure previously observed in microgravity by Kim et. al (2013) when growing PA14 biofilms over cellulose membrane. The results of the biofilms grown over cellulose membrane are reported in a separate publication (currently under revision). The bacterial inoculum was prepared with 6 ml of LBK media inoculated with PA14 and incubated at 37 °C for 16 hours (final OD595 0.706). The overnight inoculum was diluted 1:100\nwith PBS (final OD595 0.001) to maintain cells in stasis. The diluted inoculum was used to load the second chamber of FPAs. Test surface preparation: Biofilms were grown on 1 cm2 material coupons of SS316 (MPPR-311-6), pSS316, and LIS. SS316 coupons were cleaned with 1% Liquinox (Alconox Cat. 1201-1). For the pSS316, clean SS316 coupons were passivated with citric acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. C-8385). Preparation of LIS coupons (silicon wafer impregnated with silicone oil) has been described in detail previously. LIS coupons were not cleaned, to avoid removing the silicone oil, but they were prepared in sterile conditions. LIS’s silicone oil layer (0.5-1.5μm in thickness) has no bactericidal nor growth boost effect on P. aeruginosa PA14. Sample Preparation: A total of 144 samples were prepared, 72 for flight and 72 for corresponding ground controls. All coupons were prepared in the same fashion. Each gravitational condition tested three material surfaces (SS316, pSS316, and LIS), three biofilm incubation times (1, 2, or 3 days), and two termination reagents (PFA for morphology analysis and RNAlater for transcriptomics) with four replicates per condition. Flight samples were sent to the ISS on the Cygnus NG-12 spacecraft. Double-sided tape (3M, Cat. 9731) was placed on the backside of the coupons to adhere them onto the inserts. Adhered coupons on inserts were installed in the FPAs and autoclaved. FPAs were loaded with 2.75 ml of sterile 1.18X LBK and the first chamber was closed with a second insert. The use of solid inserts prevents gas exchange and forces anaerobic growth of P. aeruginosa. The first chamber was incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours as a contamination check. Afterwards, the second chamber was loaded with 0.5ml of the PA14 inoculum in stasis and\nclosed with a rubber septum. The third and last chamber was filled with 1.75 ml of PFA or RNAlater and closed with a rubber septum. Eight FPAs with the three-chamber configuration were assembled into each GAP and transferred to 4 °C. Spaceflight samples were launched in stasis (in PBS and at 4°C) to the ISS to avoid bacterial growth before microgravity conditions were achieved. Once in microgravity, astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch activated the spaceflight samples by combining the first and second chambers of the FPAs, which introduced the inoculum into the culture media. Samples were incubated at 37°C inside BioServe’s Space Automated Bioproduct Lab (SABL) for the designated incubation times (1, 2, or 3 days) in anaerobic conditions. At the end of incubation, the third chamber was introduced to fix (PFA) or preserve (RNAlater) the samples in microgravity, and samples were transferred to 4 °C or -80 °C, respectively, until unberthing. Fixed and preserved samples then returned to Earth at 4 °C and -20 °C, respectively. Once on Earth, samples were stored at 4 °C (fixed) and -80 °C (preserved) until sample processing. Ground samples were performed asynchronously, activating and terminating two hours later to replicate the order of flight procedures. The temperature profile of spaceflight samples was also reproduced for the ground samples. When spaceflight samples returned to Earth, all coupons (both flight and ground) were recovered from the FPAs and processed for morphology analysis (PFA) or transcriptomic analysis (RNAlater).     Samples preserved in RNAlater were thawed at room temperature and washed 3 times with 1ml PBS to get rid of any planktonic cells. PBS was removed and 1ml of fresh RNAlater was added. The samples were ultrasonicated for 15 min at 40 kHz, followed by 5 min of vortexing to detach biofilm bacterial cells from the surface materials.     RNA extraction was performed by University of Colorado Boulder BioFrontiers Sequencing Core and the sequencing by the Anschutz Genomics Shared Resource. The RNAlater with the suspended biofilm cells was centrifuged, and the pellet was used to extract total RNA using the Quick-RNA Fungal/Bacterial microprep Kit (Zymo Research Cat. R2010). RIN values were measured for the RNA extracted     RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v3 (Takara Cat. 634485).     Paired-end sequencing was performed on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 with 40 million reads per sample.     Transcriptomic analysis was performed on CU Boulder’s RMACC Summit supercomputing cluster. Raw sequencing files were checked for quality control using FastQC (version 0.11.9) and multiQC (version 1.0.dev0). Then Illumina adapter contamination was eliminated using Trimgalore (version 0.6.6) with cutadapt (version 2.6), after which quality control was performed again. Trimmed reads were mapped to PA14 rRNA sequences to remove the\ncontamination, the resulting unmapped reads were then mapped to the Ensembl Bacteria reference genome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 (accession number GCA_000014625), both mapping steps were performed using Bowtie2 (version 2.4.4). The mapping results were sorted, indexed, and converted from .sam files to .bam files using SAMtools (version 1.11). The reads per gene were counted with Feature Counts (Rsubread package version 2.8.2), and differential gene expression analyses were done in an R (version 4.1.1) with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0). Pathways enrichment analyses were performed online using ESKAPE Act PLUS and the whole list of DEG (including ≤2-fold change genes) per condition as input.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of Pseudomonas rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.",

          "Study Description": "Microorganisms' natural ability to live as organized multicellular communities – also known as biofilms – provides them with unique survival advantages. For instance, biofilms are protected against environmental stresses thanks to their extracellular matrix, which could contribute to persistent infections after treatment. Biofilms are also capable of strongly attaching to surfaces, where their metabolism byproducts could lead to surface material degradation. Furthermore, microgravity can alter biofilm behavior in unexpected ways, making the presence of biofilms in space a risk for both astronauts and spaceflight hardware. Despite the efforts to eliminate microorganism contamination from spacecrafts surfaces, it is impossible to prevent human-associated bacteria or fungus from eventually establishing biofilm surface colonization. Nevertheless, by understanding the changes that biofilms undergo in microgravity, it is possible to identify key differences and pathways that could be targeted to significantly reduce biofilm formation. The Space Biofilms project, performed at the International Space Station, contributes to such understanding by characterizing the morphology and gene expression of bacterial and fungal biofilms formed in microgravity with respect to ground controls. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was used as model organism for the bacterial morphology and transcriptomic studies, while Penicillium rubens was used for the fungal morphology study. Bacterial biofilm formation was characterized at one, two, and three days of incubation (37°C) over six different materials: stainless steel 316, passivated stainless steel 316, a lubricant impregnated surface (LIS), catheter grade silicone with and without a linear microtopography, and cellulose membrane.",

A 10 microliter aliquot of the stab was diluted into 100 microliters of trypic soy broth and spread onto the surface of a tryptic soy agar petri dish. After 72 hours of growth, the plate was gently scrapped to remove the biomass and placed in a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube for genomic DNA extraction.     Cell pellets resuspended in 400 microliters of 100 mM Tris, 50 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl buffer at pH 7.0 were mixed with 15 microliters RNAase A and 20 microliters of lysozyme (20 mg/mL) and incubated at 58 C for 1 hour with gentle mixing by inversion every 15 minutes.\n\nTo this mixture, 10 microliters of proteinase K (20 mg/mL) and 20% SDS to a final concentration of 2%, were added, gently mixed by inversion and incubated at 58C for 1 hour.\n\nThe mixture was then cooled on ice for 5 minutes and cell debris pelleted by centrifugation (10k x g for 10 minutes).\n\nThe supernatant was treated with 2x chloroform extractions and the genomic DNA was isolated from the aqueous phase via ethanol precipitation.\n\nDNA quality was assessed by fluorometric quantification (Qubit, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) and UV-Vis microvolume spectrophotometry (Nanodrop, Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). All gDNA manipulation was performed using wide-bore pipet tips to prevent gDNA shearing.

          "Study Protocol Description": "Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032, originally isolated from a spacecraft assembly room (Venkateswaran et al., 2001; Link et al., 2004; Gioia et al., 2007), was previously exposed, in spore form, onboard the ISS on the European Technology Exposure Facility (EuTEF) for ∼1.5 years (∼February 2008–September 2009) with parallel ground controls (Vaishampayan et al., 2012). The ISS-exposed spores were part of the UV-vacuum samples, meaning externally mounted on ISS in the EXPOSE facility and with full UV exposure (Vaishampayan et al., 2012). This exposure resulted in nearly all spores being inactivated; however, samples of viable, ‘first generation’ vegetative cells were recovered, referred to as 56 T-2 in previous reports (Chiang et al., 2019). For our follow-on study, both original, non-flown SAFR-032 and ISS-flown, surviving SAFR-032 spores were germinated (Difco nutrient broth media, 37 C, 160 RPM, overnight [∼24 h., ∼7 generations]) and used to create vegetative stocks (−80 C cell stocks in 20% glycerol) for this investigation: hereafter referred to as non-flown DS1 and ISS-flown DS2. Spores of SAFR-032 non-flown DS1 and ISS-flown DS2 were then generated with a standard sporulation method (Schaeffer et al., 1965). Three cultures of non-flown DS1 were inoculated from the freezer stocks into Difco media and grown overnight (37 C, 160 RPM). Vegetative cells were pelleted. The ISS-flown DS2 was grown separately triplicated from vegetative stocks, cells harvested and DNA extracted and quantified; DS1 and DS2 were processed separately so as not to cross-contaminate the experimental set-up.     DNA was extracted using the Qiagen PowerViral DNA extraction kit (Hilden, Germany). Modifications of the protocols were as followed: DNA was eluted off the column with 50 ul of 37 °C heated HyClone Molecular Grade H2O (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA). Quantification of DNA preparations was done with a Qubit fluorometer using the dsDNA Broad Spectrum Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).     DNA extractions were sequenced on Nanopore’s MinION (Oxford, UK) platform using the following: FLO-MIN106 flow cells, SQK-LSK109 library preparation kit, and AmPure beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The manufacturer’s protocol was modified as follows: total DNA loaded per run was 200 ng; DNA was melted off of AmPure beads by incubating at 37 °C for 10–15 min; final elution of DNA off of beads was done with Molecular Grade H2O incubated with beads at 37°C for 10–15 min.     DNA extractions were sequenced on Nanopore’s MinION (Oxford, UK) platform. DS1 and DS2 extracted DNA were run on separate flow cells to pre- vent cross-contamination of reads. Runs were performed offline without base calling. For base calls, Nanopore’s program Guppy v 3.1.5 was used.",

The resulting ISS-flown and non-flown strains were sequenced using the Nanopore MinION and an in-house method and pipeline to identify methylated positions in the genome. Our analysis indicated genomic variants and m6A methylation increased in the ISS-flown SAFR-032. To complement the broader omics investigation and explore phenotypic changes, ISS-flown and non-flown strains were compared in a series of laboratory-based chamber experiments using an X-ray irradiation source (doses applied at 250, 500, 750, 1000 and 1250 Gy); results show a potentially higher survival fraction of ISS-flown DS2 at the two highest exposures. Taken together, results from this study document lasting changes to the genome by methylation, potentially triggered by conditions in spaceflight, with functional consequences for the resistance of bacteria to stressors expected on long-duration missions beyond low Earth orbit.",

Strain IF3SW-P1 was subcultured to late log phase in TSB at 37°C prior to DNA extraction.     Genomic DNA was extracted using the DOE Joint Genome Institute 'Bacterial genomic isolation using CTAB' protocol.     The sequencing library was constructed using Q20+EA early access ligation reagents (SQK-LSK112-XL).     Oxford Nanopore sequencing with Q20+ chemistry was performed using GridION MK1 sequencer on a FLO-MIN112 R10.4 flow cell.

          "Study Description": "Due to the bacteria's evolved resistance to radiation, Klebsiella poses a great threat to not only planetary protection, but also to the integrity of future biological experiments in outer space. While previous literature has shown varying degrees of sensitivity in klebsiella to a high radiation environment, not much is known about the genetic component that yields this microbial advantage. Our research objective is to pinpoint the genetic advantage some Klebsiella species acquire as they are exposed to a space-like environment through a comparison of whole genomes sequences to better control microbial contamination onboard the ISS.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Briefly, samples collected from the ISS were processed and 100 ul of each dilution was plated on Reasoner's 2A agar (R2A). The plates were incubated at 25C for 7 days. The single colony obtained was re-streaked on R2A plates, incubated at 25C for 3 days. A biomass of approximately 1 ug wet weight was collected for each strain and pooled for DNA extraction.     Total nucleic acid extraction was carried out using ZymoBIOMICS 96 MagBead DNA kit (Lysis tubes) (Zymo Research, USA) after bead beating using Bertin Precelys. This was followed by library preparation using the Illumina Nextera Flex Protocol as per Illumina document number 1000000025416 v07.     The initial amount of DNA for library preparation was quantified and depending on the input DNA concentration, 5-12 cycles of PCR were carried out to normalize the output. The amplified genomic DNA fragments were indexed and pooled in 384 plex configuration.     Whole-genome shotgun sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flowcell PE 2x150 platform with a paired-end module.     The data was filtered with NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 (12) for high-quality (HQ) vector- and adaptor free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for HQ, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20). The number of filtered reads obtained were used for assembly with SPAdes 3.14.0 genome assembler (k-mer size- 32-72 bases).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "DNA extractions were performed on the five sieved dust samples as well as the passive aerosol sample. 50mg aliquots of the dust samples, the passive aerosol sample and the passive aerosol blank were placed in a separate 2.0mL screw top vials. To optimize the DNA recovered in the extraction 0.3g of 100um glass beads, 0.1 g of 500um glass bead sand 1g of PowerBeads were added to each sample vial. The DNA in each sample was extracted using a modified version of the QIAGEN DNeasy PowerLyzer Microbial Kit (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD, USA)(Yamamoto et al., 2012). Modifications include the alterations to the bead beating described above and a reduction in the final elution volume to 50 uL.     Library preparation was completed by RTL Genomics in Lubbock, TX. More information on the library construction can be found here: http://rtlgenomics.com/short-frag-lib     Illumina MiSeq was used to sequence 15uL aliquots of each DNA extraction at RTL Genomics in Lubbock, TX.\n\nBacterial 16S primers from the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP; http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/protocols-and-standards/16s/; 515F, 5'-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3'; 806R, 5'-GGACTACVSGGGTATCTAAT-3'), and Fungal ITS1F and ITS2 from the EMP (http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/protocols-and-standards/its/; ITS1F, 5'-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA-3'; ITS2, 5'-GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC-3'). 2x250 bp chemistry was utilized.\n\nThe sequencing data was received from RTL Genomics as raw .fastq files which have been uploaded to GeneLab.     Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.8 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.7. Primers were removed with cutadapt v2.3. DADA2 v1.12 was utilized for quality-trimming and filtering and inference of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), and taxonomy was assigned with DECIPHER v2.14 using the SILVA r138 reference database.     Five sieved dust samples and one passive aerosol sample were obtained for this study. Particles on the ISS flow with the ventilation system air currents which are designed for uniform air mixing. Particles are ultimately deposited on the air handling system filter screen coverings. These filters were vacuumed as per normal ISS housekeeping activities. The sieved dust samples were obtained from a vacuum bag returned from the Soyuz vehicle 29S in July 2012. Once returned, the particles within the vacuum bag were sieved though standard test sieves No. 60 (>250 um and <500 um), No. 100 (>150 um and <250 um), No. 140 (>106 um and <150 um), No. 200 (>75 um and <106 um) and No. 270 (>53 um and <75 um). The samples were first analyzed with optical microscopy and photography and placed in plastic ziplock bags for storage.\n\nThe passive aerosol sample from ISS Node 3 was obtained as part of the Aerosol Sampling Experiment (Meyer, 2017)(Meyer, 2018) which took place in December 2016. A passive sampler was placed above a filter, in the path of the incoming airflow, to collect airborne particles in an area where the crewmembers frequently exercised and performed hygiene maintenance. The passive sampler had five drawers containing double sided carbon tape for the collection. Each sample drawer was closed after a certain number of days of exposure to isolate the sample from other ISS air and other samples. The sample substrate that we obtained was exposed to air in the ISS for 16 days before the drawer was closed and is believed to be uncontaminated.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Among the surviving spores under UV-Space (7 strains), UV-Mars (5 strains), Dark-Space (5 strains), and Dark-Mars (15 strains) conditions, 32 strains were regrown after returning to Earth and tested for their UV survival. One strain from each of these four conditions was selected for its highest UV survival for subsequent experimentations. Cells of B. pumilus SAFR-032 (control and space-surviving strains) were grown in Trypticase soy broth overnight and diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) to achieve a density of 0.1 at the optical density at 600 nm (OD600). Initial cell density (106 to 109 CFU/ml) was estimated by serial dilution plating before each exposure. A low-pressure handheld mercury arc UV lamp (UVP, Inc.; model UVG-11; [UVC, 254 nm]) was placed at a fixed height over the sample, and the UV flux at the surface of the spore suspension was measured with a UVX digital radiometer (UVP, Inc.). Exposure times necessary to yield fluences from 200 to 4,000 J/m2 at the sample surface were determined (UV flux was 1 J/m2 s2). Under aseptic conditions, each cell suspension was placed into an uncovered 50-mm glass petri dish, within a class II biological safety cabinet fitted with UV lighting (Fisher Scientific), and stirred with a magnetic stir bar (3 to 5 mm in length) while being exposed to UV irradiation. When 10 ml (106 CFU/ml) of cell suspension was added to the 50-mm petri dish, the height of the liquid was 3 mm. The liquid spore suspension was stirred gently (100 rpm) to avoid splashing; this setup allowed the cells to be exposed to UVC evenly. From these, sample volumes of 100 μl were removed at specific time points, serially diluted, and spread atop tryptic soy agar (Difco) plates. After 24 to 48 h of incubation, the resulting CFU were counted, and the surviving fraction was calculated.\n\nSelected B. pumilus SAFR-032 strains that exhibited high UV254 resistance and were exposed to UV-Space (56T-2), UV-Mars (183T-1), Dark-Space (40T-5), or Dark-Mars (168T-5) conditions and the ground control were cultured under aerobic conditions in 300 ml of sterile Trypticase soy broth medium at 100 rpm at 25C. After 48 h, the bacterial cultures were centrifuged at 4C. The cell pellets were washed, and decanted pellets were stored at -80C until further processing.          Samples were processed as described by Romsdahl et al. with modification. Two hundred micrograms of proteins from each sample was precipitated in 20% trichloroacetic acid at 4°C. Protein pellets were obtained by centrifugation (17,000 × g), washed with ice-cold acetone, and resuspended in 25 μl TEAB (100 mM) and 25 μl 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE). Proteins were reduced by adding 1 μl of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP; 500 mM) and incubated for 1 h at 37°C (10 mM final TCEP concentration). Proteins were alkylated in the presence of iodoacetamide (IAA; 30 mM) in the dark for 1 h at room temperature. Mass spectrometry-grade trypsin/lysC (Promega, Madison, WI) at 2.5 μg per sample was used to digest the peptides overnight at 37°C.\n\nThe digested peptides were quantified using the Pierce quantitative colorimetric peptide assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Forty micrograms of peptides from each sample was labeled with the Thermo Scientific TMTsixplex (TMT6) isobaric mass tagging kit (ground control with TMT6-126, UV-Space with TMT6-127, UV-Mars with TMT6-128, Dark-Space with TMT6-129, and Dark-Mars with TMT6-130) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The TMT6-131 label was used as a reference that contained 8 μg of peptides from each of the five samples. All six labeled-peptide mixtures were combined into a single tube, mixed, and fractionated using the Pierce high-pH reversed-phase peptide fractionation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Eight fractions were dried using a SpeedVac concentrator and resuspended in 1% formic acid prior to LC-MS/MS analysis.     The samples were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer with an EASY-nLC 1000 liquid chromatograph, a 75-μm by 2-cm Acclaim PepMap100 C18 trapping column, and a 75-μm by 25-cm PepMap rapid-separation liquid chromatography (RSLC) C18 analytical column, and an Easy-Spray ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The column temperature was maintained at 45°C, and the peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 300 nl/min over a 110-min gradient, from 3 to 30% solvent B (100 min), 30 to 50% solvent B (3 min), 50 to 90% solvent B (2 min), and 90% solvent B (2 min). Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water, and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile.\n\nThe full MS survey scan (m/z 400 to 1,500) was acquired in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 120,000 and with an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 2 × 105. The maximum injection time for MS scans was 50 ms. Monoisotopic precursor ions were selected with charge states 2 to 7 with a ±10-ppm mass window using a 70-s dynamic exclusion. The MS2 scan (m/z 400 to 2,000) was performed using the linear ion trap with the collision-induced dissociation (CID) collision energy set to 35%. The ion trap scan rate was set to “rapid,” with an AGC target of 4 × 10^3 and a maximum injection time of 150 ms. Ten fragment ions from each MS2 experiment were subsequently simultaneously selected for an MS3 experiment. The MS3 scan (m/z 100 to 500) was performed to generate the TMT reporter ions in the linear ion trap using HCD at a collision energy setting of 55%, a rapid scan rate, an AGC target of 5 × 10^3, and a maximum injection time of 250 ms.     Proteome Discoverer: Raw files were converted into a .mzML file format using ProteoWizard 3.0.10875.     About 1 g of cell pellets was lysed with a buffer consisting of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) with 1:100 Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The crude homogenates were subjected to a Precellys 24 homogenizer (Bertin, Rockville, MD) in which each sample was processed inside a 2-ml cryotube with 1.0-mm glass beads three times at 4C, at 6,500 rpm, for 1 min and 3 times with 15-s pauses in between). The lysed bacterial cells were centrifuged at 17,000 x  g for 15 min. Protein concentrations in the supernatants were measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA).",

          "Study Description": "Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032 was originally isolated from the Jet Propulsion Lab Spacecraft Assembly Facility and thoroughly characterized for its enhanced resistance to UV irradiation and oxidative stress. This unusual resistance of SAFR-032 is of particular concern in the context of planetary protection and calls for development of novel disinfection techniques to prevent extraterrestrial contamination. Previously, spores of SAFR-032 were exposed for 18 months to a variety of space conditions on board the International Space Station to investigate their resistance to Mars-like conditions and space travel. Here, proteomic characterization of vegetative SAFR-032 cells from space-surviving spores is presented in comparison to a ground control. Vegetative cells of the first passage were processed and subjected to quantitative proteomics using tandem mass tags. Approximately 60% of all proteins encoded by SAFR-032 were identified, and 301 proteins were differentially expressed among the strains. We found that proteins predicted to be involved in carbohydrate transport/metabolism and energy production/conversion had lower abundance than those of the ground control. For three proteins, we showed that the expected metabolic activities were decreased, as expected with direct enzymatic assays. This was consistent with a decrease of ATP production in the space-surviving strains. The same space-surviving strains showed increased abundance of proteins related to survival, growth advantage, and stress response. Such alterations in the proteomes provide insights into possible molecular mechanisms of B. pumilus SAFR-032 to adapt to and resist extreme extraterrestrial environments.",

Partially thawed samples were transferred into 15-mL conical tubes and allowed to completely thaw on ice. Bacteria cells were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 minutes at 0 C. RNA extraction and DNase treatment were performed using the Invitrogen RiboPure-Bacteria Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The total RNA concentration was measured with Qubit 2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and RNA quality was assessed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).     Ribodepletion, cDNA synthesis, and library preparation were performed by Hudson Alpha Institute for Biotechnology (Huntsville, AL).     50bp paired-end reads were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2500     BRIC-21 utilized four Biological Research In Canisters Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs). Two BRIC_PDFUs were prepared with flight samples, and two were prepared with ground control samples. The four BRIC-PDFUs included five 60 mm Petri dishes (10 flight, 10 ground control). 1x10^7 B. subtilis spores (strain 168) were air dried onto the 20 Petri dishes (10 flight, 10 ground control). Flight samples were delivered to the ISS on SpaceX-6 which launched 4/14/15. Once aboard the ISS, growth of both microbes was initiated by the addition of 8.5 mL of TSY-Glycerol media (10% glycerol (v/v), 1.7% (w/v) tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) NaCl, 0.3% soytone, 0.3% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.25% (w/v) K2HPO4, 0.25% (w/v) glucose). B. subtilis samples were grown for 25 hours at 23 C without agitation. Growth was terminated by transferring the BRIC-PDFUs to the onboard minus eighty-degree laboratory freezer for ISS (MELFI). Matching ground controls were grown asynchronously following the same procedures using identical hardware with the same ISS environmental conditions that the flight samples were exposed to. Before sample return on 5/21/15, all BRIC canisters were transferred to -32 C cold bags and maintained at this temperature until arrival at Kennedy Space Center (KSC).

          "Study Protocol Description": "BRIC-23 utilized four Biological Research In Canisters Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs) -- two were prepared with flight samples, while two were prepared with ground control samples. The four BRIC-PDFUs included five 60 mm Petri dishes (10 flight, 10 ground control).  For Staphylococcus aureus: 1x10^7 S. aureus cells (strain UAMS-1) were air dried onto 20 Petri dishes (10 flight, 10 ground control). Flight samples were delivered to the ISS on SpaceX-9 which launched 7/18/16. Once aboard the ISS, growth of both microbes was initiated by the addition of 8.5 mL of TSY-Glycerol media (10% glycerol (v/v), 1.7% (w/v) tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) NaCl, 0.3% soytone, 0.3% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.25% (w/v) K2HPO4, 0.25% (w/v) glucose). S. aureus samples were grown for 48 hours, at 20-30 C without agitation before growth was terminated by transferring the BRIC-PDFUs to -80 C. Matched ground controls followed the same procedures using identical hardware with the same ISS environmental conditions that the flight samples were exposed to.  Sample Return and De-Integration: Before return on SpaceX-9 (8/29/16), all BRIC canisters were transferred to -32 C cold bags and maintained at this temperature until arrival at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). At KSC, BRIC-PDFUs were de-integrated and the Petri dishes containing experimental samples were then removed and stored at -80 C.  Note: Ground control (GC2) experiment was repeated due to low CFU recovery from the original ground control experiment. Repeated samples followed the same procedures using identical hardware and ISS environmental conditions as stated above. All the samples sent out for omics analyses were from GC2 experiment.\n\nFreezing Control Experiment: Organism source culture was sent from the same species and strain used for spaceflight experiment from KSC. Starting culture was propagated under organism optimal growth conditions. We measured OD at 660nm with a SpectraMax i3x (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale CA). 1X10^7 cells were added to 8.5 mL of TSY with 10% glycerol and incubated at 22.5 C for 48 hours. At growth culmination, 6 plates were processed without freezing (ASAP). For the remaining 6 plates, samples were slow frozen by placing plates on a heat block inside a styrofoam box with the lid closed and placed in -80 C freezer to match the freezing rate of the BRIC-23 spaceflight samples (FROZEN). A temperature monitor data logger was placed in each container to record the temperature. Slow-frozen plates were processed after 24 hours. Samples were processed following the same protocols as BRIC-23 spaceflight/ground control samples.     Petri dishes containing the samples, kept at -80 C, were transferred from KSC to ARC GeneLab Sample Processing Lab. During processing, samples were removed from freezer and partially thawed on ice. Using a cell scraper, cells were gently removed from the bottom surface of the plate and transferred to a conical tube. To assess the total cells per petri dish, we measured OD at 660nm with a SpectraMax i3x (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale CA). Using a previously established index, we predicted the number of cells in each plate then divided the cell suspension for the various extractions: RNA, Protein and Metabolite. Predicted cell numbers were verified by conducting serial dilutions and plating the cell suspensions to estimate the viable cell numbers (CFU/plate).  GeneLab processed 9 out of the 10 plates for spaceflight and 10 out of 10 plates for ground control (GC2). Due to the biomass constraint not every plate yielded the required CFU/plate to generate all the extracts.  Metabolite Preparation: From the aliquot provided, the cell suspension was centrifuged for 5 min, 10K(g) at 0 C. The supernatant was removed from the pellet and placed in a 1.5mL tube. The pellet and supernatant were snap frozen by submerging the tubes into a LN2 container. Samples were stored at -80 C freezer until shipment to West Coast Metabolomics Center for Omics Processing.     The aliquoted tube of bacteria culture was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 minutes at 0 C.  After removing the media, 350 -400 ul of RNAwiz (RiboPure RNA Purification Kit, bacteria; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was added to resupsend the cell pellet by vortexing.  The mixture was transferred to a tube pre-filled with 250 ul Zirconia beads and placed horizontally on a vortex at maximum speed for 20 minutes followed by centrifuging at 16,000 g for 5 minutes at 4 C. The bacteria lysate was transferred to a new eppendorf tube followed by adding 0.2 volumes of chloroform, mixed vigorously by inverting the tube for 30 seconds followed by incubation for 10 minutes at room temperature.  The tube was then centrifuged at 16,000 g for 5 minutes at 4 C and the aqueous phase containing RNA was separated and purified with ethanol and wash solutions included in the kit.  The purified RNA was treated with DNase I per the manufacturers protocol to eliminate DNA contamination.    RNA concentration was measured with Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and RNA quality was assessed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).     Ribodepletion done with Illumina Gram Positive Bacteria. Library Preps done with KAPA RNAHyper reagents. 10 cycles PCR done.     Sequencing performed on Illumina HiSeq 4000 single read 90bp.     Metabolite extraction was completed by West Coast Metabolomics Center. Primary metabolomics assay was completed following a lipidomics (polar phase) extraction protocol. Lipidomics assay was completed using WCMC lipidomics (non-polar phase) extraction protocol.     Completed using West Coast Metabolomics Center labeling protocols. For Primary metabolomics, derivatization with methoxyamine + MSTFA chemical modification was performed.     Samples were processed at West Coast Metabolomics Center using the Leco Pegasus for Gas Chromatography and Agilent Quadropole TOF 6530 for Liquid Chromatography.     Data processing was completed by WCMC using Binbase and MS-Dial. Database used for lipidomics: Lipid blast and MSP library. Refer to the data dictonary files attached to each assay.  Raw files were converted into a .mzML file format using ProteoWizard 3.0.10875.     The aliquoted tube of bacteria culture was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 minutes at 0 C.  After removing the media, the cell pellet was washed with 7ml of PBS (- calcium/- magnesium), centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 minutes at 0 C. PBS was removed and the pellet was resuspended with 1ml of lysis buffer consisting of 8M urea, with 50mM ammonium bicarbonate, at pH 8.5 in DNase- and RNase- free H2O, protease inhibitors were added at 1:100 ratio of 0.1M m-phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride solution in ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri)  and 1:100 of Halt protease inhibitor cocktail EDTA-free 100X (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). This cell lysis buffer protocol was provided by Stanford University Mass Spectrometry. The cells were homogenized on ice for 3 minutes using OmniLyse HL Cell Lysis Kit (ClaremontBio Solutions, Upland, CA). The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 g for 10 min at 4 C to remove cell debris. Supernatant was aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 C.  Protein concentration was assessed with Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Waltham, MA)   For ground control samples, GC2_SA-A2, GC2_SA-B5, and GC2_SA-A4 protein extracts were pooled to accommodate the minimum omics center requirement of 25 ug. The pooled sample ID is GC2_SA-A2-B5-A4_PRT.     Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility using the following SUMS protocol:  25 uL of 50mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0 was added to each sample, followed by 1.5 uL of 500mM DTT, incubated at 50C for 30 minutes and cooled to room temperature. 3 uL of 1M propionamide was added to each sample and incubated at room temperature for 1hr. 75 uL of 50mM ammonium bicarbonate, 0.02% protease max was added to each sample followed by 1.5 ug of trypsin/lysC (Promega) and overnight incubation at 37C.  10 uL of 10% formic acid, 90% water was added to each sample to quench the digest. The samples were incubated at 37C for 10 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 10,000g for 5 minutes. Microspin C18 columns (NEST group, p/n SEM SS18V) were equilibrated with acetonitrile followed by 2 times wash with 0.1% formic acid/water and each sample was cleaned and concentrated independently per vendor protocol. The eluant peptides were dried in a speed vac to be less than 2 uL volume and stored at 4C prior to TMT isobaric labeling. Each peptide pool was reconstituted in 100 uL, 100mM HEPES, pH 8.0. The TMT isobaric labels were reconstituted in 40 uL absolute ethyl alcohol and 20 uL of each isobaric tag as described above was added to the corresponding sample. The samples incubated at room temperature for 1.5hr, followed by the addition of 5 uL hydroxylamine to quench the reaction. 50 uL of each isobaric-tagged peptide pool was drawn and pooled to a final volume of 500 uL, 500 uL of 0.1% formic acid water was added to a final volume of 1mL. This fraction (~250 ug total peptide) was purified on a Water Oasis HLB 3cc C18 cartridge per vendor protocol and the final eluent dried to completion in a speed vac. SCX offline fractionation was performed using a Protea SCX column (p/n SP-155) and the provided buffers. In brief, the previously dried 10plex peptide pool was dissolved in 150 uL reconstitution solution and loaded onto the equilibrated SCX column (3 times) followed by 2 sequential washes. The elution solution provided in the kit was diluted in series to 50mM, 100mM, 150mM, 200mM, 300mM and 400mM (stock) concentrations. The peptides were then eluted starting with the 50mM salt concentration and collected in a new tube for the entire series. 200 uL of 0.1% formic acid water was added to each SCX eluted fraction and each was Microspin C18 purified as previously described. Each fraction was reconstituted in 20 uL 0.2% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile, 97.8% water and injected for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis.     Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility using the Thermo Orbitrap Fusion MS.

The BRIC-23 mission was designed to measure the response of Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus to the spaceflight environment. This experiment aimed to produce high quality omics data from B. subtilis and S. aureus grown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to allow comparison to matched ground controls. There were two primary objectives for this experiment: (1) Demonstrate all post-flight processes and operations required for successful completion of GeneLab Reference Missions conducted on ISS, and (2) Generate high quality GeneLab Reference Mission omics data sets for two prokaryotic model organisms, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. Freezing Control Experiment: The BRIC hardware has significant thermal inertia, thus the freezing rate of samples placed at -80 C is quite slow. This could affect RNA-sequencing, proteomic and metabolic data sets. In an effort to understand how slow freezing could affect these data sets, a control experiment was designed in which B. subtilis and S. aureus were grown in petri plates and either slow frozen to -80 C at a rate matching the BRIC-23 spaceflight samples or processed immediately to harvest RNA and protein. B.subtilis omics data is deposited in GLDS-138.",

Bacillus subtilis str. 168 STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.3a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, ensembl genome version ASM904v1 (Bacillus_subtilis_subsp_subtilis_str_168.ASM904v1.dna.toplevel.fa), and the following gtf annotation file: Bacillus_subtilis_subsp_subtilis_str_168.ASM904v1.46.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Bacillus subtilis str. 168 STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.3a) and aligned reads were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1). Quantification data was imported to R (version 3.6.3) with tximport (version 1.14.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.26.0).\n\nDifferential expression analysis was performed in R (version 3.6.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.26.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor packages: STRINGdb, PANTHER.db, and the annotation package org.Bsubtilis.eg.db, which was created using AnnotationForge, GO.db, and makeOrgPackageFromNCBI with Taxonomy ID: 224308.

The BRIC-23 mission was designed to measure the response of Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus to the spaceflight environment. This experiment aimed to produce high quality omics data from B. subtilis and S. aureus grown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to allow comparison to matched ground controls. There were two primary objectives for this experiment: (1) Demonstrate all post-flight processes and operations required for successful completion of GeneLab Reference Missions conducted on ISS, and (2) Generate high quality GeneLab Reference Mission omics data sets for two prokaryotic model organisms, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. Freezing Control Experiment: The BRIC hardware has significant thermal inertia, thus the freezing rate of samples placed at -80 C is quite slow. This could affect RNA-sequencing, proteomic and metabolic data sets. In an effort to understand how slow freezing could affect these data sets, a control experiment was designed in which B. subtilis and S. aureus were grown in petri plates and either slow frozen to -80 C at a rate matching the BRIC-23 spaceflight samples or processed immediately to harvest RNA and protein. S. aureus omics data is deposited in GLDS-145.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "The environmental control system aboard the ISS includes a distributed ventilation system that contains high-efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filter elements to remove suspended particulate matter from the cabin atmosphere and protect humidity-control and air-purification equipments from debris accumulation and biofouling. The HEPA filter element analysed during this study was manufactured in September 1998, installed in the ISS in January 2008 and returned aboard space shuttle flight STS-134/ULF6 in late May 2011. This filter had been installed in ISS Node 2 and was in service for 40 months at this location. The HEPA filter remained untouched in its shipment packaging from the time it was removed from the ISS until particulates were recovered at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for microbial characterization in September 2013.     Sample processing: All samples were subjected to a variety of microbiological and molecular techniques to elucidate composition of cultivable, viable, and total microorganisms. Independent of the samples taken to cultivate bacterial and fungal analyses, subsamples of the same samples were taken for DNA extraction. Weighing vacuum debris samples was possible, whereas the HEPA filter elements were divided into small pieces and particulates associated with the pieces were aseptically collected using sterile scalpels before being quantitatively measured. Approximately 1 g of each HEPA filter associated particle was weighed and placed into a sterile tube containing 25 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and vortexed for 1 min. After vigorous mixing, large particles were allowed to settle, and aliquots of samples were carefully siphoned and allocated for culture-based (1 mL) and culture-independent analyses (15 mL).\n\nTraditional culture-based microbial examination: For estimating bacterial populations, after suitable serial tenfold dilution in sterile PBS, 100 μL of the sample suspension was spread onto two plates of R2A media (BD Difco, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and incubated at 25C for 2–7 days. For the fungal population enumeration, 100 μL was spread onto two plates of potato dextrose agar (PDA, BD Difco, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and incubated at 25C for 2–7 days. Bacterial and fungal colony-forming units (CFUs) were counted and reported as CFU/g of material. Identifications and phylogenetic affiliations were carried out via sequencing for both bacteria and fungi by targeting the 16S rRNA gene  and the ITS region, respectively. When identifications were ambiguous, sequencing of an additional gene (gyrB) was performed to confirm the phylogenetic identity of the purified bacterial isolates.\n\nSample processing for molecular analysis: The biological materials associated with each sample (15 mL) were further concentrated using Amicon Ultra-50 Ultracel centrifugal filter tubes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Each filter unit has a molecular mass cutoff of 50 kDa, which facilitates the concentration of microbial cells, spores, and exogenous nucleic acid fragments greater than 100 bp in a final volume of 2.5 mL. All filtered samples were then divided into three separate aliquots: the first aliquot (1000 μL) was subjected to PMA pretreatment (viability assessment), the second (1000 μL) was an untreated environmental sample (viable + nonviable; total DNA), and the third (500 μL) was used for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) analysis (see below).\n\nFor measuring viable microbial population, one aliquot of filter-concentrated sample suspension (1000 μL) was treated with 12.5 μL of PMA (2 mM; Biotium, Inc., Hayward, CA) to a final concentration of 25 μM, followed by thorough mixing and incubation in the dark for 5 min at room temperature. The sample was exposed to PhAST blue-Photo activation system for tubes (GenIUL, S.L., Terrassa, Spain) for 15 min (in parallel with the non-PMA-treated sample). This step enabled blocking DNA from dead cells. The samples were then split in half and one half was subjected to bead beating with the Fastprep-24 bead-beating instrument (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) with parameters set at 5 m/s for 60 s. The second half of the unprocessed sample was then combined with the mechanically disrupted counterpart before DNA was extracted via the Maxwell 16 automated system (Promega, Madison, WI), in accordance with manufacture instructions. Resulting DNA suspensions (100 μL each) were stored at −20C.     The library preparations for next-generation sequencing and Illumina MiSeq sequencing were conducted by GENEWIZ, Inc. (South Plainfield, NJ). The DNA samples were quantified using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and DNA quality was confirmed by electrophoresis (0.8 % agarose gel). The sequencing library was constructed using a MetaVx Library Preparation kit (GENEWIZ, Inc., South Plainfield, NJ). In brief, 5–50 ng of DNA was used for amplicon generation to cover the V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of 16S rDNA. Indexed and universal adapters were added to the ends of the 16S rDNA amplicons by limited-cycle PCR. The DNA libraries were validated with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) and quantified using Qubit and real-time PCR (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA).     The DNA libraries were multiplexed and loaded on an Illumina MiSeq following the instructions from the manufacturer (Illumina, San Diego, CA). A 2 × 150 paired-end (PE) configuration was used for sequencing. The image analysis and base calling were processed using MiSeq Control Software. The initial taxonomy was performed on Illumina’s BaseSpace cloud computing platform.     A total of 12,244,464 paired-end reads were generated, and CLC Genomics Workbench version 10.0.1 was used to filter for adapter-free, high-quality reads.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "E. coli ATTC 4157 was cultured and challenged with Gentamicin Sulfate (between 0 and 150 ug/mL) on board the International Space Station while maintaining matched ground (1g) controls (every tested condition consisted of four replicates). BioServe's spaceflight hardware, Fluid Processing Apparatus (FPA) and Group Activation Packs (GAP) were used for flight and ground samples. The FPA contains four chambers, the first one was loaded with 2.75 mL of Growth Medium (Medium E), the second with 0.50 mL inoculum (E. coli at a concentration that would yield and experiment start cc of 1.2e6 cell/mL), the third with 0.25 mL of antibiotic, and the fourth with 2.10 mL of fixative (RNA Later II).\n\nSamples were sent to the International Space Station at 4C in FPAs, as described above. Temperature was increased to 37C and 23 hours later, the experiment was started by introducing the inoculum (E. coli ATCC 4157) into the growth medium (Medium E as described in Vogel & Bonner (1956) supplemented with 5 g/L glucose), yielding 3.25 mL of a culture with a starting cell concentration of 1.22e6 cell/mL.\nThe ground controls were similarly prepared and maintained.     Antibiotic solutions were prepared on December 10, 2014 and were maintained at 4°C afterwards. The loading of the hardware was finalized and it was handed over for integration into the Cygnus spacecraft on December 13, 2014. The experiment hardware was maintained at 4°C until experiment start. AES-1 launched onboard Orbital CRS-1 on January 9, 2014 with the samples held at 4°C. After being berthed to ISS, three days later the samples were transferred from the transport CGBA to another CGBA onboard Station waiting at 4°C. After transfer, the ISS CGBA was commanded to 30°C and 23 hours later, the first activation took place (introduction of the inoculum into the growth medium, as seen in Fig 6). Nineteen hours later the second activation was conducted (introduction of the antibiotic solution into the growth chamber). Thirty hours later the experiment was terminated (fixative allowed to mix with the culture). Thus, the experiment total processing time was 49 hours.\n\nNineteen hours after experiment start, antibiotic (Gentamicin Sulfate (MP Biomedical, Cat No. 1676045, Santa Ana, CA, USA)) was introducing into the cultures. Antibiotic concentration varied from one sample to the next from 0 to 150 ug/mL in 25 ug/mL steps.     After the experiment conclusion, the GAPs containing FPAs with PFA as fixative were stored in the ISS CGBA, which was then commanded to 20°C. The ones with RNA Later II were placed in the MELFI freezer at -75°C. The space samples remained stored as indicated until their return to Earth. The PFA-fixed samples came back on SpaceX-3, which landed May 18, 2015, and the RNA Later II samples returned on SpaceX-4 on October 25, 2015. All of these operations were repeated on Earth for the ground controls with the same timing and conditions, but with an 8 hour offset.     Four ml of the bacterial suspension in RNALater II and Medium E growth medium were spun down at 200g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet were resuspended in 200ul PBS and mixed by pipetting. 100ul aliquots were taken out for DNA and RNA extraction from the same sample. RNA extraction was done using Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with on-column DNase digestion. Final elution was made in 30 uL dH2O. The concentration and integrity of the total RNA was estimated by Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA Assay Kit  (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA), respectively.\nRibosomal RNA (rRNA) was removed using Ribo-Zero Gold (Yeast) kit (Epicenter, Madison, WI) using manufacturer's recommended protocol. Immediately after the rRNA removal the RNA was fragmented and primed for the first strand synthesis using the NEBnext First Strand synthesis module (New England BioLabs Inc., Ipswich, MA). Directional second strand synthesis was performed using NEBNExt Ultra Directional second strand synthesis kit.     Following this the samples were taken into standard library preparation protocol using NEBNext DNA Library Prep Master Mix Set for Illumina with slight modifications. Briefly, end-repair was done followed by polyA addition and adapter ligation. Post-ligated materials were individually barcoded with primers and amplified through 12 cycles of PCR. Final library quantity was assessed by Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit and the library quality was estimated on LabChip GX (Caliper, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Accurate quantification of the final libraries for sequencing applications was determined using the qPCR-based KAPA Biosystems Library Quantification kit (Kapa Biosystems, Inc., Woburn, MA). Each library was diluted to a final concentration of 12.5 nM and pooled equimolar prior to clustering.     Paired-End (PE) sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer (Illumina, Inc.).",

          "Study Description": "Bacterial behavior has been observed to change during spaceflight. Higher final cell counts, enhanced biofilm formation, increased virulence, and reduced susceptibility to antibiotics have been reported to occur for cells cultured in space . Most of these phenomena are theorized as being an indirect effect of an altered extracellular environment, where the carbon source uptake is inhibited and excreted acidic byproducts buildup around the cell due to the lack of gravity-driven transport forces. However, to date neither spaceflight results, ground-based studies, physical measurement techniques nor computational approaches have provided sufficient evidence needed to confirm this model. Gene expression data from the Antibiotic Effectiveness in Space (AES-1) experiment, however, have now allowed us to look into the biomolecular processes behind these observations and showed a systematic activation of glucose starvation and acid resistance genes. These results corroborate the reduced mass transport model proposed to govern bacterial responses to spaceflight. Furthermore, the gene expression data suggests that metabolism was stimulated in space, which could play a role in causing the observed increase in bacterial cell concentrations in microgravity. Similarly, the decrease in extracellular pH may also be involved with the reported increase in virulence in space.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "MinION Library Preparation\nAliquots of DNA for mouse, E. coli, and lambda libraries were sheared individually using Covaris  g-TUBEs  (Covaris,  Boston,  MA)  by  centrifugation  at  4,800  x g  for  2  min  to  produce fragments  that  were  predominantly  8  kb.  Fragmentation  was  verified  using  a  2100  Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Sheared mouse, E. coli, and lambda DNA samples were quantified using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and combined in equal abundances, targeting 1.5 ug total (0.5 ug each). Mixed DNA samples then underwent  treatment  to  repair  residual  nicks,  gaps,  and  blocked  3'  ends  using  Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) DNA Repair Mix (New England Biolabs), with modifications to the manufacturer's protocol to include a 0.5X Agencourt AMPure XP system magnetic bead clean-up (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Brea, CA) to remove small fragments of DNA.\n\nThe repaired DNA was then prepared for sequencing according to Oxford Nanopore Technologies™ procedure for the SQK-MAP-006 Kit. Following library preparation, individual samples were mixed with a 102 ng aliquot of pre-sequencing library (150 ul) with 162.5 ul of 2X running buffer, 6.5 ul fuel mix (Oxford  Nanopore Technologies) and 156 ul molecular-grade sterile deionized water to a total  volume of 450 ul. This volume was loaded into a 1 ml syringe and the syringe was capped. A total of 18  samples  were  prepared: nine flight samples and nine ground  control  samples.  Capped syringes containing the samples were packaged with an identical 1 ml syringe for potential bubble removal  and  syringe  tips  were  placed  inside  of  a  large  plastic  tube  to  facilitate  transport. After syringe loading, the tubes were stored at -80 C.\n\nPacBio RSII Library Preparation\nSingle  Molecule,  Real-Time  (SMRT)  sequencing  libraries  were  prepared  using  the SMRTbell  Template  Prep  Kit  1.0  (Pacific  Biosciences)  and  20  kb  Template  Preparation  Using  BluePippin  Size-Selection  System  protocol  (Pacific  Biosciences).  5 ug  of  each  sample were used.  Library quality and quantity were determined using an Agilent 2200 TapeStation and Qubit dsDNA  BR  Assay  (Life  Technologies),  respectively.\n\nIllumina MiSeq Library Preparation\nSequencing libraries were prepared from 1 ng of sample using the NexteraXT kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's protocol.  Libraries were indexed with dual 8-nt barcodes on each end  of  the  sequencing  amplicon.  In total, 4 dual-indexed DNA sequencing libraries were constructed, corresponding to lambda bacteriophage, E. coli, mouse, and an equimolar mixture of DNA from the 3 organisms. Libraries were quantitated using the Agilent Bioanalyzer and Qubit spectrophotometer.\n     Samples analyzed in this study contained sequence libraries prepared from mixtures of female mouse BALB/C (Zyagen, San Diego, CA),\nEscherichia coli K-12 (Zyagen), and N6-methyladenine-free bacteriophage lambda (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) genomic DNA.\n     Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION (v6)\nSequencing was  initiated  using  MAP_Lambda_Burn_In_Run_SQK_MAP006.py  protocol  selected  from  the  MinKNOW  software.  Real-time  communications  with  the  ISS  allowed  the  ground  control  flow cells  and  samples  to  be  retrieved,  temperatures  equilibrated,  and  injected  for  priming  and  final  sample loading in a synchronous manner.\n\nPacBio RSII\nSequencing  was  conducted  using  P6-C4 chemistry and a v3 SMRT Cell (Pacific Biosciences) at Weill Cornell Medicine\n\nIllumina MiSeq\nSequenced  on  an  Illumina MiSeq  as  a  1  x  160  base  pair  (bp)  single-end sequencing run. The approximate percentage of the run allocated to each library as determined by the quantified  input  concentration was 3%  for  lambda  bacteriophage,  17%  for E.  coli, 30%  for mouse, and 50% for the equimolar mixture.     The  nine  flight  samples  were  removed  from  the  -80 C  freezer,  placed  on  dry  ice  in  a  Styrofoam cooler, and shipped overnight to the launch processing facility at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Once at KSC, the samples were maintained in a -80 C freezer until transfer to the powered freezer on the SpaceX Dragon Capsule. To more closely approximate the handling of the flight samples, the nine ground control samples were also removed from the freezer, placed on dry ice in a Styrofoam cooler and allowed to sit on the laboratory bench for the same amount the time that the flight samples were out of the freezer during transit. Samples  were  maintained  within  the  launch  processing  labs  at  KSC until 48 h before the launch, at which point they were loaded onto the vehicle.\nThe  DNA  samples  were launched  in  a  powered  freezer  in  which temperatures were maintained between -80 and -90 C. Upon docking with the ISS, the flow cells and DNA samples were transferred to refrigerator (+2 to+8 C) and freezer (-80 to -90 C) dewars within the Minus Eighty Degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI), respectively. All other items were stored at ambient ISS conditions.     MinION data\nThe SURPIrt pipeline is a real-time analysis pipeline for automated metagenomic pathogen detection and reference-based genomic assembly from nanopore sequencing data. We simulated a real-time SURPIrt analysis of the NASA runs using both ground and in-flight nanopore data downloaded from the ISS. For the simulation, the SURPIrt pipeline was run in automated mode to continually scan a download directory containing raw FAST5/HDF files from the MinION sequencer for batch analysis. We used Minimap v0.2-r124-dirty and Miniasm v0.2-r137-dirty as described in the github tutorial, using 8 threads (https://github.com/lh3/miniasm). Two assemblies were generated, using reads that mapped exclusively to Escherichia coli K12 MG1655 using GraphMap from the four runs on the ISS, and all reads from the ISS that did not map to host organisms (human and mouse, using genomes hg38 and mm10). We then polished these assemblies using nanopolish v0.5.0. We used Canu v1.73 (20) at default parameters using a specified target genome size of 4.8 MB to de novo assemble contigs directly from in-flight nanopore data corresponding to the metagenomic mixture of mouse, E. coli, and lambda genomes. Runs were performed using both a 64-core computational server with 512 gigabytes (Gb) memory and an 8-hyperthreaded core laptop with 64 Gb memory. Four sets of de novo assemblies were generated: (1) in-flight runs 1-3 (n=46,871), (2) in-flight runs 1-4 (n=84,502), (3) in-flight runs 1-4 after removal of host M. musculus reads (n=53,287), and (4) in-flight runs 1-4 from bacterial reads identified using the SURPIrt pipeline. Assembly metrics, including N50, were calculated by the abyss-stats.pl program in ABySS (21). E. coli were mapped to the consensus PacBio genome using Mauve version 2.4.0 (22). Genome-wide pairwise identities of de novoassemblies were estimated using JSpeciesWS (23) after specifying the use of MUMmer (24) for pairwise identity calculations.\n\nPacBio data\nWe performed a de novo assembly of the E. coli genome used in this study using the PacBio data. We used the Hierarchical Genome Assembly Process (HGAP, v2) for read-cleaning and adapter trimming (pre-assembly), de novo assembly with Celera Assembler, and assembly polishing with Quiver (18). Raw sequencing reads were filtered for length and quality such that the minimum polymerase read score was 0.8, the minimum subread length was 500 bp, and the minimum polymerase read score was greater than 100. The assembly was generated using CeleraAssembler v1 with the default parameters and was polished using the Quiver algorithm (18). Our assembly yielded a single contig of 4,734,145 base pairs at >99.7% accuracy and confirmed the E. coli sample as strain K-12.\n\nIllumina data\nWe next performed independent de novo and directed assemblies of the E. coli genome using single-end Illumina data. Raw Illumina reads were preprocessed for trimming of adapters and removal of low-complexity and low-quality sequences. E. coli reads were identified using Bowtie2 alignment against the E. coli reference genome in local alignment mode at default parameters. De novo assembly was performed using the SPAdes genome assembly v3.8.2 (19) with the careful parameter.",

          "Study Description": "As part of an ongoing effort to catalogue microbial communities inhabiting the International Space Station (ISS) crew-associated environmental samples were collected from the Japanese Kibo Russian and US research modules. Initial analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified 11 Bacillus isolates (two from Kibo Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) four from US Segment Harmony Node 2 and five from Russian Segment Zvezda module sites) all belonging to the Bacillus anthracis-B. cereus-B. thuringiensis group. Isolates were further characterized by whole genome comparative analysis. Each isolate was sequenced assembled and aligned against all members of the B. cereus sensu lato group. Based on genome size estimates (5.2 - 5.3 Mbp) strain nucleotide identity (>99.99%) and maximum likelihood phylogenetic placement all isolates were found to exhibit a very high level of similarity. With respect to gene content all isolates were inspected for cry proteins common to B. thuringiensis as well as toxins specific to B. cereus. No significant hits were found to any known cry genes while full-length matches were found for multiple B. cereus toxin genes. Finally the isolates were closely screened against B. anthracis genomes and no B. anthracis signatures were identified. Notably all isolates contained the plcR ancestral C allele and lacked significant hits to pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids and toxins. The collective results from the analysis confirm that these strains belong to a previously uncharacterized Bacillus species hereafter referred to as Bacillus issensis. The type strain is ISSFR-003T (=NRRL B-65389T= DSMZ 101676T).",

To synchronize germination spores in water (~1 x 10^9) were heat activated at 70 xc3 x80 xc3 xb6C for 30 min then harvested by centrifugation. To initiate germination spores were resuspended in 100 ml of 2x LB medium containing the germinant L-alanine (10 mM final concentration) in a 250-ml Klett flask and agitated vigorously in a rotary water bath shaker at 37 xc3 x80 xc3 xb6C. Germination was monitored by loss of optical density as measured in a Klett-Summerson photometer fitted with the No. 66 (660 nm; red) filter.     Raw and normalized intensities were extracted from scanned images background subtraction quantile and Loess normalization were performed by UF-ICBR. The microarray contained 15,209 data points equivalent to 4,103 genes with an average number of 3.7 measurements per gene; the oligos were designed such that each Open Reading Frame (ORF) was sampled at multiple locations (n = 3 or 4). Log-transformed data sets for each ORF from simulated Mars-exposed spores were compared to the same ORF from the ground control spores using one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).

          "Study Description": "Because of their ubiquity and resistance to spacecraft decontamination bacterial spores are considered likely potential forward contaminants on robotic missions to Mars. Thus it is important to understand their global responses to long-term exposure to space or Mars environments. As part of the PROTECT experiment spores of B. subtilis 168 were exposed to real space conditions and to simulated martian conditions for 559 days in low Earth orbit mounted on the EXPOSE-E exposure platform outside the European Columbus module on the International Space Station. Upon return spores were germinated total RNA extracted and fluorescently labeled and used to probe a custom Bacillus subtilis microarray to identify genes preferentially activated or repressed relative to ground control spores. Increased transcript levels were detected for a number of stress-related regulons responding to DNA damage (SOS response SP-beta prophage induction) protein damage (CtsR/Clp system) oxidative stress (PerR regulon) and cell envelope stress (SigV regulon). Spores exposed to space demonstrated a much broader and more severe stress response than spores exposed to simulated Mars conditions. The results are discussed in the context of planetary protection for a hypothetical journey of potential forward contaminant spores from Earth to Mars and their subsequent residence on Mars. Two-color microarrays were performed comparing germination of Space-exposed or Mars-exposed vs. ground-control (Earth) spores.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "After 24 hours of cultivation, the contents of every bioreactor was gently mixed by pipetting and divided into several aliquots. Ten millilitres of culture from each growth condition was immediately fixed with RNA Protect Reagent (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions, and fixed cell pellets were frozen at -20 C until RNA extraction. Samples were immediately exposed to different stresses. The extraction of total RNA was performed with the Total RNA Isolation System (Promega). RNA quality and quantity were assessed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 electrophoresis system and the Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop technologies) respectively. cDNA synthesis and further processing for the transcriptomic analysis were performed according to the protocol of the GeneChip manufacturer (Affymetrix). Ten micrograms of total RNA per sample was used for cDNA synthesis and a Poly-A RNA control was added to the RNA sample using the GeneChip eukaryotic poly-A control kit (Affymetrix). The synthesis of cDNA was performed using denatured total RNA (70 C for 10 min), 13 ng/ul random hexamer primers (Roche), 0.5 U/ul SUPERase In (Ambion), 25 U/ul SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 0.5 nmol/ul deoxynucleoside triphosphates in 1x first strand buffer with 10 nmol/ul dithiothreitol. The latter mix was placed in a Thermocycler operated at 25 C for 10 min, 37 C for 60 min, 42 C for 60 min and 70 C for 10 min. The remaining RNA was degraded by treatment with 1 N NaOH, incubation for 30 min at 65 C and subsequent neutralization with 1 N HCl. cDNA was purified using a MiniElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen), where after the concentration of cDNA was assessed using the Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop technologies). Eight micrograms of cDNA was fragmented to a size range of 50-200 nucleotides with DNase I (Promega) for 10 min at 37 C where after the enzyme was inactivated at 99 C for 10 min. The fragmented cDNA was verified by loading a sample on a 2% agarose gel containing 0.1 %0 (v/v) GelRed (Biotium).     Fragmented cDNA was end-labelled with biotin-dUTP using the GeneChip DNA labelling reagent (Affymetrix) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Promega) in 1x reaction buffer (Promega) at 37 C for 60 min. The reaction was stopped using 0.5 M EDTA.     Biotinylated cDNA was hybridized to GeneChip P. aeruginosa Genome arrays (Affymetrix) by incubation in a GeneChip hybridization oven 640 at 50C with orbital shaking at 60 r.p.m. for 16 h in the following MES-buffer [2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid]: 0.1 ug/ul herring sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 ug/ul bovine serum albumine (Invitrogen), 7.8% dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 mM B2 control oligo (Affymetrix) in 1x hybridization buffer (made according to instructions of Affymetrix GeneChip). Microarray slides were washed according to the manufacturer's protocol and stained using a fluidics station 450 (Affymetrix) and applying the Midi_euk2v3_450 protocol. Briefly, the staining procedure was comprised of the following steps: (i) binding of streptavidin (Invitrogen) to the biotin-labeled hybridized cDNA, (ii) binding of a biotin-conjugated streptavidin antibody (Labconsult) and (iii) binding of R-phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen).     Microarrays were scanned at the emission wavelength of 570 nm where after the data analysis took place.     DData were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.5 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.5/Microarray/Affymetrix/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAffymetrix). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.4). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using oligo (version 1.58.0). Raw data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). The raw probe level intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the oligo (version 1.58.0) quantile method. Normalized probe level data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). Normalized probe level data was summarized to the probeset level using the oligo (version 1.58.0) RMA method. Gene annotations were retrieved for each probeset from ThermoFisher (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/sec/assets?url=TFS-Assets/LSG/Support-Files/Pae_G1a-na36-annot-csv.zip, created March 2016, accessed June 2024). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probeset to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value.     The wild type P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain (ATCC 15692) was used in this study and all cultures were grown in Lennox L Broth Base (LB) (Life Technologies) at 28 C. An overnight shaking culture (125 r.p.m.) of P. aeruginosa in LB was washed and diluted in 0.85% NaCl solution to an OD600 of 1. This bacterial suspension was used to inoculate fresh LB medium at a final concentration of 10-4 CFU/ml.     Synthecon Rotating Wall Vessel bioreactors (RWV) (50 ml or 10 ml) were filled with inoculated medium so that no headspace (i.e. no bubbles) was present. Other than for stress resistance assays, for which 10 ml capacity bioreactors were used, RWV bioreactors with a capacity of 50 ml were adopted for all experiments. Identical bioreactors were mounted in triplicate on (i) a RWV device in vertical position (LSMMG) (Cellon), (ii) a RWV device in horizontal position (NG) and (iii) the center of the inner Random Positioning Machine (RPM) frame (RG) (Fokker Space), and placed in a large humidified (70%-80% relative humidity) culture chamber, to avoid evaporation of culture medium through the gas-permeable membrane at the back of each vessel. A 25 r.p.m. rotation speed was adopted for the RWV cultures, while RPM-cultures were randomly rotated at 10 r.p.m.. Bacteria were grown in the three described test conditions for 24 hours.     The absorbed dose from ionizing radiation received by the flight specimens was estimated using TLD passive dosimeters located in the middeck of the space shuttle, where the payload was located. More specifically, we computed the average between three dosimeters (DLOC1, DLOC2, and DLOC3) for the mission and we divided it by the total duration of the mission to estimate the average absorbed dose rate in mGy/day. This dose rate did not include any shielding effects from the hardware where the specimens resided. The total absorbed dose in water was then computed by simply multiplying the average dose rate with the duration of the experiment. The duration of the experiment was defined as the time in space during which the specimen was living. Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. A table with these detailed computations for all space shuttle datasets is available on GeneLab at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.  The ground samples were not assessed for radiation exposure.",

          "Study Description": "This study describes the transcriptional response of P. aeruginosa PAO1 to low-Earth orbit environmental conditions. Our aim was to assess whether the microgravity environment of spaceflight could induce virulence traits in P. aeruginosa. To this end, P. aeruginosa cultures were grown in space, and the expression profile was compared with ground control samples (both in biological triplicate). Characterization of bacterial behavior in the microgravity environment of spaceflight is of importance towards risk assessment and prevention of infectious disease during long-term missions. Further, this research field unveils new insights into connections between low fluid-shear regions encountered by pathogens during their natural infection process in vivo, and bacterial virulence. This study is the first to characterize the global transcriptomic and proteomic response of an opportunistic pathogen that is actually found in the space habitat, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Overall, P. aeruginosa responded to spaceflight conditions through differential regulation of 167 genes and 28 proteins, with Hfq identified as a global transcriptional regulator in the response to this environment. Since Hfq was also induced in spaceflight-grown Salmonella typhimurium, Hfq represents the first spaceflight-induced regulator across the bacterial species border. The major P. aeruginosa virulence-related genes induced in spaceflight conditions were the lecA and lecB lectins and the rhamnosyltransferase (rhlA), involved in the production of rhamnolipids. The transcriptional response of spaceflight-grown P. aeruginosa was compared with our previous data of this organism grown in microgravity-analogue conditions using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor technology. Interesting similarities were observed, among others with regard to Hfq regulation and oxygen utilization. While LSMMG-grown P. aeruginosa mainly induced genes involved in microaerophilic metabolism, P. aeruginosa cultured in spaceflight adopted an anaerobic mode of growth, in which denitrification was presumably most prominent. Differences in hardware between spaceflight and LSMMG experiments, in combination with more pronounced low fluid shear and mixing in spaceflight when compared to LSMMG conditions, were hypothesized to be at the origin of these observations. Collectively, our data suggest that spaceflight conditions could induce the transition of P. aeruginosa from an opportunistic organism to potential pathogen, results that are of importance for infectious disease risk assessment and prevention, both during spaceflight missions and in the clinic.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "R. rubrum S1H agar cultures prepared according to the space flight experimental setups described in BASE-A sample were exposed to ionizing radiations in the calibration room facility at SCK xc3 xa2 xc2 x80 xc2 xa2CEN (Mol Belgium). In order to mimic the ISS ionizing radiation environment pure 137Cs gamma and 252Cf neutron sources were used as representative of low-linear energy transfert (LET) and high-LET particles respectively. The source reference values were traceable to primary standards (PTB for gamma and NPL for neutrons). During irradiation samples were kept rotating at 2 rpm in between the two sources for 10 days (maximum irradiation time allowance) at 21 xc3 x82 xc2 xb0C  xc3 x82 xc2 xb1 2 xc3 x82 xc2 xb0C being exposed to a total dose of ca. 2 mGy (Figure 3). Actual absorbed dose was assessed in situ by using TLD  s (LiF:Mg,Ti   TLD-100   from Harshaw Bicron United Stated and LiF:Mg,Cu,P   MCP-N   from TLD-Poland Poland) and OSLD  s (Al2O3:C   TLD-500   from Harshaw-Bicron) for gamma detection and bubble detectors (BD-PND-BDT from Bubble Technology Industry Canada) for neutron detection.     R. rubrum S1H cultures prepared according to the space flight experimental setups described in BASE-A sample were cultivated in the ESA random positioning machine (RPM) facility located at the University of Sassari (Italy) (Figure 3). The RPM was operated as a random walk 3D-clinostat (basic mode) with an angular velocity of rotation of 60 deg/s for 10 days.     Cultures of R. rubrum S1H grown as mentioned above were transported at room temperature from SCK xc3 xa2 xc2 x80 xc2 xa2CEN (Mol Belgium) to Baikonour (Kazakhstan) 10 days before launch. Three biological independent culture suspensions were deposited 24 hours before launch as 4 spots of 20  xc3 x82 xc2 xb5l corresponding to 6x106 cells or as 1 mat of 100  xc3 x82 xc2 xb5l corresponding to 3x107 cells per ca. 10 cm xc3 x82 xc2 xb2 surface of a 5 ml layer Sistrom-succinate agar medium in 6 well culture plates (CellStar 6 Greiner Bio-One Belgium) and kept at room temperature.     Total RNA was extracted using a SV Total RNA Isolation System kit (Promega United States) and stored at -80  xc3 x82 xc2 xb0C. The quality/integrity of total RNA was checked using a BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent United States) and total RNA quantity was measured using the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop technologies United States).     RNA amplification was performed using consecutively both MessageAmp xc3 xa2 xc2 x84 xc2 xa2 II-Bacteria Kit for prokaryotic RNA amplification producing the amplified RNA (aRNA) and Amino Allyl MessageAmpTM II aRNA Amplification kit (Ambion United States) producing the Amino Allyl RNA (aaRNA) following the manufacturer xc3 xa2 xc2 x80 xc2 x99s instructions. The quality/integrity of total RNA and amplified RNA was checked using a BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent United States). aaRNA was labeled using the ChipShot xc3 xa2 xc2 x84 xc2 xa2 Indirect Labeling and Clean-Up System (Promega and Corning United States) following the manufacturer xc3 xa2 xc2 x80 xc2 x99s instructions. The ChipShot xc3 xa2 xc2 x84 xc2 xa2 Indirect System provides reagents and enzymes for generating fluorescently labeled cDNA using a two-step labeling process that includes synthesis of aminoallyl-modified cDNA followed by conjugation to the CyDye xc3 xa2 xc2 x84 xc2 xa2 NHS ester.     The two differentially labeled cDNAs were resuspended in the universal hybridization buffer (Pronto kit; Corning-Promega United States) mixed and added jointly to the surface of the spotted microarray glass slide for overnight hybridization at 42 xc3 x82 xc2 xb0C using a HS 4800 Pro automated hybridization station (TECAN Switzerland).

The slide was washed according to the Pronto kit xc3 xa2 xc2 x80 xc2 x99s protocol and then dried in the hybridization station.     Spots were analyzed using GenePix Pro v.6.0.1 software and flagged according to their quality. Quality check was performed for each array using the ArrayQuality package from BioConductor (Gentleman et al 2004). Raw median intensity data were imported into R version 2.7.0 for statistical analysis using the LIMMA package version 2.14.1 (Smyth 2005) as available from BioConductor. Raw data were background-corrected based on convolution of normal and exponential distributions with an offset of 50 (Ritchie et al 2007). Data were normalized within each array using the loess normalization algorithm (Smyth and Speed 2003) and between each array using Aquantile normalization (Yang and Thorne 2003). The in-slide replicate correlations were calculated using the Duplicate correlation function in the LIMMA package (Smyth et al 2005). The log expression values were fit to a linear model and moderated t-statistics were calculated using empirical Bayes method (Smyth 2004). P-values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamin and Hochberg xc3 xa2 xc2 x80 xc2 x99s method to control the false discovery rate (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995).

Whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray and high throughput proteomics which offer the possibility to survey respectively the global transcriptional and translational response of an organism were used to test the effect of space flight. Moreover in an effort to identify a specific stress response of R. rubrum to space flight ground simulation of space ionizing radiation and space gravity were performed under identical culture setup and growth conditions encountered during the actual space journey. This study is unique in combining the results from an actual space experiment with the corresponding space ionizing radiation and modeled microgravity ground simulations which lead to a more solid dissection of the different factors contribution acting in space flight conditions. Total RNA was extracted from R. rubrum S1H grown after 10 days in space flight or after 10 days in simulated ionizing radiation or simulated microgravity.

Moreover, the effects of space flight on microbial pathogenicity and associated infectious disease risks have not been studied. The bacterial pathogen Salmonella typhimurium was grown aboard Space Shuttle mission STS-115 and compared with identical ground control cultures. Global microarray and proteomic analyses revealed that 167 transcripts and 73 proteins changed expression with the conserved RNA-binding protein Hfq identified as a likely global regulator involved in the response to this environment. Hfq involvement was confirmed with a ground-based microgravity culture model. Space flight samples exhibited enhanced virulence in a murine infection model and extracellular matrix accumulation consistent with a biofilm. Strategies to target Hfq and related regulators could potentially decrease infectious disease risks during space flight missions and provide novel therapeutic options on Earth.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Ten micrograms of RNA was reverse transcribed by random priming according to the Pronto kit instructions (Corning-Promega, United States) and directly labeled by incorporation of Cy3-dCTP or Cy5-dCTP nucleotides (Amersham Bioscience, United Kingdom) for respectively control and experimental samples.     The two differentially labeled cDNAs were resuspended in the universal hybridization buffer (Pronto kit; Corning-Promega, United States), mixed, and added jointly to the surface of the spotted microarray glass slide for overnight hybridization at 42Â°C using a HS 4800 Pro automated hybridization station (TECAN, Switzerland). The slide was washed according to the Pronto kitâs protocol and then dried in the hybridization station.     The two differentially labeled cDNAs were resuspended in the universal hybridization buffer (Pronto kit; Corning-Promega, United States), mixed, and added jointly to the surface of the spotted microarray glass slide for overnight hybridization at 42Â°C using a HS 4800 Pro automated hybridization station (TECAN, Switzerland). The slide was washed according to the Pronto kitâs protocol and then dried in the hybridization station.     Spots were analyzed using GenePix Pro v.6.0.1 software and flagged according to their quality. Quality check was performed for each array using the ArrayQuality package from BioConductor (Gentleman et al, 2004). Raw median intensity data were imported into R version 2.7.0 for statistical analysis using the LIMMA package version 2.14.1 (Smyth, 2005) as available from BioConductor. Raw data were background-corrected based on convolution of normal and exponential distributions with an offset of 50 (Ritchie et al, 2007). Data were normalized within each array using the loess normalization algorithm (Smyth and Speed, 2003) and between each array using Aquantile normalization (Yang and Thorne, 2003). The in-slide replicate correlations were calculated using the Duplicate correlation function in the LIMMA package (Smyth et al, 2005). The log expression values were fit to a linear model and moderated t-statistics were calculated using empirical Bayes method (Smyth, 2004). P-values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamin and Hochbergâs method to control the false discovery rate (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).     ID_REF equals  less than br greater than VALUE equals normalized log ratio data representing experimental sample/control sample less than br greater than P-VALUE equals P-values were calculated using the limma package (BioConductor) and were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamin and Hochberg's method to control the false discovery rate.     Total RNA was extracted using a SV Total RNA Isolation System kit (Promega, United States) and stored at -80 C. The quality/integrity of total RNA was checked using a BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent, United States) and total RNA quantity was measured using the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop technologies, United States).     R. rubrum strain S1H was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC25903). Sistrom medium A containing 2 g l−1 Na-succinate (Sistrom, 1960) or Sistrom-peptone-yeast medium (Saegesser et al., 1992) containing 30 g l−1 peptone and 10 g l−1 yeast extract (BD Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), supplemented with 20 g l−1 agar for solid cultures, were used. For the MESSAGE 2-related experiments Sistrom-peptone-yeast was used, whereas Sistrom-succinate was used for the BASE-A-related experiments. The 869 medium (Mergeay et al., 1985) supplemented with 2 mM H6TeO6 (Sigma-Aldrich, Bornem, Belgium) was used for post-flight analysis of tellurate resistance.     Space Flight\nThree independent cultures of R. rubrum S1H grown to stationary phase in Sistrom medium A in dark aerobic conditions were suspended in 0.85% NaCl (Saline tablets, Oxoid, Hampshire, United Kingdom) to a final OD680 of ca. 0.600 and transported at room temperature from the laboratory in SCK·CEN (Mol, Belgium) to the cosmodrome in Baikonour (Kazakhstan) 8 days before launch. Inoculation was performed 15 h before launch on Sistrom-peptone-yeast Petri dishes (Surfair Plate, PBI International, Milano, Italy). Drops of 10 μl containing 3 × 107 colony forming units of R. rubrum S1H, as well as dilution series (3 × 103 and 3 × 102 colony forming units) for viable count purpose, were spotted in biological triplicates spread over two agar plates (Supplementary Figure 1A). After inoculation, Petri plates were sealed first with Parafilm (Pechiney Plastic Packaging, Chicago, IL, USA) and Kapton tape (3M, Cergy-Pontoise, France), next, individually packed in Ziplock bags, and then jointly packed in a second Ziplock bag and placed in a sealed jar. Radiation dosimeters (Track-Etch Detectors, Optically Stimulated Luminescence Detectors and ThermoLuminescent Detectors, described in Goossens et al., 2006) and temperature sensors (CUBE, Meilhaus Electronic, Puchheim, Germany) were added in the jar. This jar was then wrapped in protective foam and NOMEX fabric bags (DuPont, Richmond, VA, USA) and stored at room temperature (Supplementary Figure 1). Finally, the exterior of the package was disinfected with 3% hydrogen peroxide wipes according to Russian flight procedures and was placed into the Soyuz (TMA-3) 8 h before launch. On arrival in the ISS (after 2 days at ambiant temperature in the Soyuz), the containers were incubated for 8 days in the Russian Service Module of the ISS behind structural bars (Supplementary Figure 1E) at a relative constant temperature of 21±2 °C.\n\nGround Controls\nCultures of R. rubrum S1H grown as mentioned above were transported at room temperature from SCK·CEN (Mol, Belgium) to Baikonour (Kazakhstan) 10 days before launch. Three biologically independent culture suspensions were deposited 24 h before launch as 4 spots of 10 μl for life count, as mentioned above, and as 1 mat of 150 μl corresponding to 3 × 107 cells per ca. 10 cm2 surface of a 5 ml layer Sistrom-succinate agar medium in six-well culture plates (CellStar 6, Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany) (Supplementary Figure 1F) and kept at ambient temperature. An oxygen indicator strip (Anaerotest, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was added at the bottom of the multiwell plate in between the wells, to visualize oxygen concentration in the gas phase in the multiwell plate during incubation pre-, in- and post-flight. Culture plates were sealed with one layer of Parafilm and one layer of Scotch tape (3M, Cergy-Pontoise, France). Radiation dosimeters (Track-Etch Detectors and Optically Stimulated Luminescence Detectors described in Vanhavere et al., 2008) and temperature sensors (SmartButton, ACR Systems, Surrey, BC, Canada) were added in the container.\n\nMicrogravity Simulation\nR. rubrum S1H cultures, prepared according to the space flight experimental set-ups described above, were mounted on the European Space Agency random-positioning machine (RPM) facility located at the University of Sassari (Italy) in a room with an ambient temperature of ca. 22 °C (Figure 1a). The RPM was built by Dutch Space in Leiden (The Netherlands) and is similar to an earlier Japanese model, which was extensively reviewed in Hoson et al. (1997). The total sample package (20 × 20 × 10 cm3) was mounted at the center of the two independent frames for which rotation is driven by two separate motors. The RPM was operated as a random walk three-dimensional clinostat (basic mode) with an angular velocity of rotation of 60 deg s−1 (Walther et al., 1998) for 10 days (maximum cultivation time allowance for that facility). Random rotation at 60 deg s−1, 1–10 cm away from the center of rotation, yields gravity contours from 1.12 × 10−3 to 1.12 × 10−2 g as calculated by g′equals (ω2R)/g0, where ω equals 1.05 radian s−1, R equals 0.01–0.10 m and g0 equals 9.81 m s−2 (Hoson et al., 1997; Boonyaratanakornkit et al., 2005).     Space Flight\nAfter a total of 10 days flight, including ca. 2 days in the Soyuz and ca. 8 days in the ISS (18–28 October 2003), the samples returned to the Earth (Soyuz TMA-2). After landing in the Kazakhstan desert (near Arkalyk), the jar containing the cultures in Petri dishes was transported within 40 h at 4 °C without exposure to airport X-rays scanning, to SCK·CEN (Mol, Belgium). In contrast, the parallel-prepared ground control samples returned immediately after preparation in Kazakhstan to SCK·CEN and were cultured in dark conditions under comparable temperature and time profile as the ISS samples. From both ground control and ISS-exposed samples, colonies were harvested for both transcriptomic and proteomic analysis.\n\nGround Control\nTwo culture plates were sealed hermetically in one polycarbonate ‘Biocontainer’ (PedeoTechniek, Oudenaarde, Belgium) (described in Vanhavere et al., 2008) and vacuum sealed in a highly transparent Minigrip polyethylene bag (Minigrip, Brussels, Belgium) of 60-μm thickness. During the 2-day trip in the Soyuz (TMA-9) to the ISS, the temperature of the pouch was maintained at 22±1 °C. After docking, all samples were stored at ambient temperature in the ISS Russian Zvezda service module (the exact location in the module is unknown) and a temperature of 21±1 °C was recorded. The samples returned to the Earth after a total of 12 days in-flight including ca. 2 days in the Soyuz and ca. 10 days in the ISS (17–28 September 2006). Samples were handled as mentioned for the MESSAGE 2 experiment, and 24 h after landing of the Soyuz (TMA-8) the analysis was started at SCK·CEN. The parallel ground control experiment was maintained at 22±1 °C during transport from Baikonur to Belgium in transportation box, followed by an incubation at 22±1 °C, and simultaneously cooled down to 4 °C after landing of the space samples. From both ground control and ISS exposed samples, colonies and cell mats were harvested for transcriptomic and proteomic analysis.     To mimic the ISS-ionizing radiation environment, 137Cs γ and 252Cf neutron sources were used as representative of low-linear energy transfer (LET) and high-LET particles, respectively. 137Cs is a common mono-energetic source of 0.662 MeV γ rays (LET up to 10 keV μm−1). The neutron source 252Cf has been studied in the SCK·CEN calibration room facility (Vanhavere et al., 2001) and is expelling a neutron spectrum with an average energy of 2.1 MeV (LET up to 250 keV μm−1). The source reference values were traceable to primary standards (PTB for γ and NPL for neutrons). R. rubrum S1H agar cultures, prepared according to the space flight experimental set-ups, were exposed to ionizing radiation in the calibration room facility at SCK·CEN (Mol, Belgium). During irradiation, samples were kept rotating at 2 r.p.m. in between the two sources for 10 days (maximum irradiation time allowance for the facility) at 21±2 °C (Figure 1b), being exposed to ca. 0.16 mGy day−1 of γ rays and 0.02 mGy day−1 of neutron rays, totaling ca. 1.8 mGy per 10 days, which is comparable with the actual space flights experiments (Goossens et al., 2006; Vanhavere et al. 2008). The total cumulative absorbed dose was measured in situ by using ThermoLuminescent Detectors (LiF:Mg, Ti ‘TLD-100’ from Harshaw Bicron, Solon, OH, USA and LiF:Mg,Cu,P ‘MCP-N’ from TLD-Poland, Kraków, Poland) and Optically Stimulated Luminescence Detectors (Al2O3:C ‘TLD-500’ from Harshaw Bicron) for γ dosimetry and bubble detectors (BD-PND/BDT from Bubble Technology Industry, Chalk River, ON, Canada) for neutron dosimetry. Non-irradiated control samples were kept outside the irradiation bunker at the same temperature for the same period of time.",

          "Study Description": "In view of long-haul space exploration missions, the European Space Agency initiated the Micro-Ecological Life Support System Alternative (MELiSSA) project targeting the total recycling of organic waste produced by the astronauts into oxygen, water and food using a loop of bacterial and higher plant bioreactors. In that purpose, the alpha-proteobacterium, Rhodospirillum rubrum S1H, was sent twice to the International Space Station and was analyzed post-flight using a newly developed R. rubrum whole genome oligonucleotide microarray and high throughput gel-free proteomics with Isotope-Coded Protein Label technology. Moreover, in an effort to identify a specific response of R. rubrum S1H to space flight, simulation of microgravity and space-ionizing radiation were performed on Earth under identical culture set-up and growth conditions as encountered during the actual space journeys. Transcriptomic and proteomic data were integrated and permitted to put forward the importance of medium composition and culture set-up on the response of the bacterium to space flight-related environmental conditions. In addition, we showed for the first time that a low dose of ionizing radiation (2 mGy) can induce a significant response at the transcriptomic level, although no change in cell viability and only a few significant differentially expressed proteins were observed. From the MELiSSA perspective, we could argue the effect of microgravity to be minimized, whereas R. rubrum S1H could be more sensitive to ionizing radiation during long-term space exploration mission.",
