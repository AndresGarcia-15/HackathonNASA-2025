          "Study Protocol Description": "The APH Science Carrier is a root module that is divided into four quadrants, each independently controlled. Each quadrant is filled with a porous granular ceramic substrate that was sieved to a particle size of 1-2 mm. The substrate was washed with DI water to remove dust and autoclaved in a covered tray for 30 minutes. The substrate was dried in a forced air oven at 70 degrees C for a minimum of 72 hours until thoroughly dry. Dry and sterile 1-2 mm substrate was weighed and mixed with Nutricote controlled release fertilizer prills. Each quadrant of the Science Carrier was filled with 990 grams of substrate and planted with 12 pepper seeds placed in 3 rows and secured with guar. The overall planting density was 240 plants per meter squared. Seeds were planted in April 2021 and the science carrier was sealed inside a bag and was packaged in foam before being launched from the Kennedy Space Center on Space X CRS-22 on 3 June 2021. The pre-planted science carrier was installed in the APH facility by the Flight Engineer on 12 July 2021 and imbibed until saturated. A team at KSC continuously monitored and tele-operated the experiment from Earth, controlling watering, lighting, and other environmental conditions. The plants germinated and grew for 14 days at an average photosynthetic photon flux of 300 micromol per meter squared per second, a photoperiod of 15 hours day / 8 hours night and an average air temperature setting of 23 degrees C, 80% Relative Humidity, and a wind speed of 0.3 m/s were selected set points and changed as the study progressed. There were 3 pre-programmed light settings throughout the study each having an average of 300 micromol per meter squared per second at three different heights from the science carrier surface. As the plant grew to each of these heights, the lighting was adjusted accordingly. The light spectral quality was 27% red, 33% green, and 40% blue light. The CO2 concentration was controlled at 550 ppm throughout the experiment to reduce the effects of intumescence however CO2 concentrations varied as the plants matured. After 14 days the relative humidity was reduced to 50% and the root zone volumetric moisture content was lowered to 50% respectively. The root zone volumetric moisture was lowered again to 40-45% after thinning to one plant per quadrant and maintained until the end of the experiment. Ethylene concentration was controlled by recirculating the APH chamber air through a scrubber filled potassium permanganate coated pellets. Wind speed was increased periodically after flowers were first seen to assist in flower pollination. Hand pollination was also conducted on each flower by a crew member. During the growth period, the crew thinned the plants on day 28, removed debris from the chamber on days 40, 50, 70, 90, and 110, inserted plant support stands on day 50 to stabilize and provide support to the plant stems, assisted with hand pollination, and harvested the plants.     Harvests took place on day 137. At the completion of the second harvest in November 2021, the PH-04 SC was stowed at ambient temperature and returned to Earth in January 2022. Fruit and leaves were wrapped and stored at -80 degrees C on the ISS until returned to Earth and maintained at that temperature until processing. The Science carrier was returned to KSC where it was placed at 4 degrees C until processing. Samples were taken from the science carrier / root tray surface using swabs and components were sampled. Fruit and leaves were frozen at -80 degrees C in the station's MELFI and maintained at that temperature when received at KSC until processing.     All samples were processed for molecular sequencing. Microbial DNA was isolated from approximately 100 mg of plant tissue (leaf, stem, root, fruit, and seed) or component and placed in a 2 mL sterile screw cap centrifuge tube with up to 4 sterile, stainless steel beads (2.8mm) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were immediately processed in a Bead Ruptor Cryo Mill for 2 minutes at a frequency of 30 Hz. After processing through the Cryo Mill and minimizing tissue thaw, 300 micro liters of power bead solution from the DNeasy UltraClean Microbial Kit was added to the 2 mL tube and vortexed to mix the contents. The subsequent extraction followed the manufacturer's recommendations. Liquid samples from water and swabs were collected after microbial sampling was completed and centrifuged to collect the cell component. Pellets were recovered and the DNA was isolated using the DNeasy UltraClean Microbial kit. DNA was quantified using the Qubit ds DNA Assay for downstream application. The foam and wick samples processed in the same way as the swab samples.     16S PCR was completed with V4 region, customized barcoaded 15S rRNA gene primers as described by Kosich et al. 2013. The PCR master mix contained 1x PCR buffer, 2.25 mM MgCL2, 300 mM dNTPs, 300 nM forward and reverse primers, and 0.25 units of Platinum Taq polymerase. Each reaction was completed in duplicate with 1ng of DNA template per reaction. The thermocycling conditions were denatured at 95 degrees C for e5 minutes followed by 30 cycles at 95 degrees C for 10 minutes completed the PCR. Replicates of PCR reaction were combined, and cleaned with Min-Elute Cleanup System to remove excess primers and dNTPs. Amplicon concentration was determined with the Qbit 2.0 ds DNA assay and nanomolar concentration calculated for each sample. Samples were diluted to 4nM and an equimolar concentration library was created per Illumina's library preparation guidelines.     The library was spiked with a 10% PhiX aliquot to the library and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform with a 500 cycle V2 sequencing kit with 250 bp paired ends and FASTQ reads at more than 30 quality score.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Astronauts were instructed to swab a 5cm x 5cm surface on selected racks and locations across nine USOS modules, avoiding connector panels, utility panels, cables, and non-permanent stow bags (with the exception of modules primarily used for stowage, where surfaces available for sampling mostly comprised stow bags). A raster pattern with a zigzag technique was suggested for surface sampling.     Total nucleic acid extraction was performed from one cotton swab of each dual headed sampling device  (n equals 803) using the MagMAX Microbiome Ultra total nucleic acid isolation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat A42357), as previously described. Briefly, 96-well extraction bead-plates pre-filled with surface swabs or control aliquots in each well (see Sample collection and plating) were subjected to total nucleic acid extraction following the manufacturer’s protocol. Lysis was performed with a TissueLyser II (Qiagen). Bead clean-ups were performed with the KingFisher flex purification system (Thermo Fisher Scientific).     We performed low-biomass, 16S V4 rRNA gene (16S) amplicon sequencing on nucleic acid extractions (n equals 803) using KatharoSeq methods and Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) PCR primers. KatharoSeq incorporates appropriate controls during sample processing to disambiguate true biological signal in low-biomass samples from background noise that arises from reagent kit and plasticware contaminants. Amplicon library preparation was performed through miniaturized PCR reactions as previously described. Due to the low-biomass characteristics of dry surface swabs, a higher template nucleic acid input volume was used, compared to the standard EMP 16S protocol (https://earthmicrobiome.org/protocols-and-standards/16s/). Briefly, for a miniaturized 10µL total PCR reaction volume, 3.6 µL of PCR-grade water, 4.0µL of Platinum Hot Start PCR Master Mix (2x)(Thermo Fisher, Cat 13000014), 0.2µL of Forward primer (10 µM), 0.2µL of Reverse primer (10 µM), and 2µL of extracted total nucleic acid were mixed into each well of a 384-well PCR plate. PCR amplification followed the standard EMP thermocycler conditions. 16S amplicon libraries were equal volume pooled and PCR cleaned using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Cat 28104).     Clean library pools were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform using MiSeq 300 cycle (2x151 paired end reads) reagent kit (v2) (Illumina, Cat MS-102-2002) and custom sequencing primers outlined in the standard EMP 16S protocol.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.     Pure solvent used as instrumental blanks. Mixed standard solution of six chemicals as instrument internal standards. Swabs extracted with 50:50 ethanol:water (v:v).     Data-dependent acquisition using a Vanquish ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system coupled to a Q Exactive quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Chromatography column was Kinetex C18 column (50 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 µm particle size, 100 A pore size; Phenomenex, Cat 00B-4475-AN) with SecurityGuard C18 column (2.1 mm ID; Cat AJ0-8782) at 30 °C column temperature. The mobile phases (0.5 mL/min) were 0.1 % formic acid (Fisher Scientific Cat A117-50) in both water (A) and ACN (B) with the following gradient: 0-1 min 5 % B, 1-7 min 5-100 % B, 7-7.5 min 100 % B, 7.5-8 min 100-5% B, 8-10 min 5% B.     The raw spectra were converted to .mzML files using MSconvert (ProteoWizard).     Shotgun sequencing libraries from samples that passed KatharoSeq thresholds were prepared following a high-throughput, miniaturized KAPA HyperPlus (Roche, Cat KK8514) library preparation protocol, exhaustively described previously. Briefly, DNA from each sample was quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat KK8514), and then normalized to 5 ng in 3.5µL of molecular-grade water using an Echo 550 acoustic liquid-handling instrument (Labcyte). When sample DNA concentration was insufficient to reach the intended 5 ng input, a 3.5µL aliquot of sample was transferred. During library preparation with KAPA HyperPlus, reagents for each step (enzymatic fragmentation, end-repair and A-tailing, and adaptor ligation) were added at a 1:10 ratio of the recommended volumes, using a Mosquito HV micropipetting robot (SPT Labtech). Fragmentation was performed at 37ºC for 20 min. Sequencing adapters and barcode indices were added in two steps, following the iTru strategy previously described. First, the Mosquito HV robot was used to add universal ‘stub’ adapters and ligase mix to the end-repaired DNA, and the ligation reaction was incubated for 30 min at 20ºC. Adapter-ligated DNA was purified using AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter, Cat A63881) magnetic beads and a BlueWasher purification robot (BlueCat Bio) at a ~0.8X bead:sample ratio, with one 80% ethanol wash. Clean beads were resuspended in 6µL of molecular-grade water. Later, the elution was transferred into a PCR plate with unique i5 and i7 index combinations (iTru). The PCR plate was produced by aliquoting 5µL of KAPA HiFi PCR MasterMix (Roche,Cat  KK2602) to a 384-well PCR plate, and dispensing 0.25µL of each unique primer pair (0.25µL of i5 and 0.25µL of i7) to each well. Secondly, the purified adapter-ligated DNA was amplified by transferring 4.5µL of elution of each sample to the 5.5µL of PCR master mix per well, in a 384-well PCR plate. The 10µL PCR reaction was amplified for 15 cycles following the recommended KAPA HyperPlus thermal cycling conditions. Amplified shotgun library was purified with AMPure XP magnetic beads and the BlueWasher (BlueCatBio), as described earlier, at a ~0.8X bead:sample ratio. Each sample was eluted into 10µL of water, and the elution was transferred to a 384-well echo compatible plate (Labcyte, Cat NC1731983) using a Mosquito HV. Samples were equal volume pooled using the Echo 550 liquid handler (Labcyte). The sequencing pool was quality checked with an TapeStation (Agilent, Cat  5067-5584 and Cat  5067-5585), size selected to a 300 - 700 bp range using a Pippin Prep electrophoresis instrument (Sage Sciences, Cat HTC2010).     The sequencing pool was sequenced on a low-output iSeq v2 (300 cycle) (Illumina, Cat 20031371) sequencing platform to generate sequence count distributions.  A second, normalized sample pool was generated from sequence count normalization, as previously described139. The normalized pool was quality checked, size selected, and sequenced (2x151 paired end reads) on a lane of a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flowcell v1.5 (300 cycle) (Illumina, Cat  20028312).     Utilizing kraken2 v2.1.1, a human genome reference database was constructed from NCBI's RefSeq (GCF_000001405.39) GRCh38.p13, with --no-masking, and defaults of kmer-length 35 and minimizer-length of 31. FASTQ files were screened against this database, and all successfully classified reads were removed.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.",

We produced a 3D map of the microbes and metabolites throughout the International Space Station (ISS), with 803 samples collected during space flight, including controls. We find that the use of each of the nine sampled modules within the ISS strongly drives the microbiology and chemistry of the habitat. Relating the microbiology to other Earth habitats, we find that, as with human microbiomes, built environment microbiomes also align naturally along an axis of industrialization, with the ISS providing an extreme example of an industrialized environment. We demonstrate the utility of culture-independent sequencing for microbial risk monitoring, especially as the location of sequencing moves to space. The resulting resource of chemistry and microbiology in the space-built environment will guide long-term efforts to maintain human health in space for longer durations.",

To assess differences in outcomes due to age, twenty 10-12 week-old and twenty 32 week-old mice were flown, respectively. To directly assess spaceflight effects, half of the young and old mice (10 old, 10 young) were sacrificed on-orbit after 22-23 days (ISS Terminal, ISS-T), while the other half (10 old, 10 young) were returned live to Earth after 40 days and allowed to recover for 2 days (Live Animal Return, LAR) before sacrifice. Both the ISS-T and LAR animals had independent ground controls (10 mice housed in flight hardware in matched environmental conditions), basal controls (10 mice sacrificed 1 day after launch), and vivarium controls (10 mice housed within standard vivarium habitats). Thus RRRM-1 included a total of 160 mice. All mice (BALB/cAnNTac) were sourced from Taconic Biosciences (Germantown, NY). Mice were weighed, chipped with BMDS RFID chip (IMI-500) and shipped to NASA KSC for delivery at approximately L-4 weeks. Mice were housed and maintained in the Animal Care Facility (ACF) at NASA KSC with 12:12 light cycle matched in timing to the light cycle used for Transporters and Habitats programmed for flight. All mice were housed in cages of 5 mice/cage with the same littermates as they had been raised. Mice were initially given ad lib standard lab chow and water, which was changed on a schedule of 2x per week. Mice were housed initially on standard bedding and provided igloo-type enrichment. Animal health was checked daily by appropriately trained NASA personnel and contracted lab technicians. At L-3 weeks, mice were placed on raised mesh flooring to simulate spaceflight Transporter and Habitat cage conditions, given water delivered through lixits identical to those used in the flight hardware and put on the NASA Nutrient-Upgraded Rodent Foodbars (NuRFB). Food and water was changed weekly and mice were weighed bi-weekly. Igloo-type enrichment was provided in all cages. At L-10 days, mice were grouped (10 mice per cage) in larger cages for social acclimation prior to launch. Groupings were done based on age of animals and with regard to establishing similar average weights between any given grouping. At L-2 days, baseline, spaceflight and ground control groups were identified. At L-1 day, spaceflight animals were loaded into spaceflight Transporters. Habitat Ground Control (HGC) mice were loaded into Transporters on a 3-day offset from spaceflight animals. Vivarium Ground Control (VGC) mice (also on a 3-day offset) were returned to 5 mice/cage and placed on standard bedding and provided water through typical sipper tubes at launch equivalent. All mice were maintained on NuRFB throughout the duration of the study. Spaceflight and HGC mice were given new food at weekly intervals. VGC mice were given new food and fresh water also on weekly intervals. Mold contamination of food: Spaceflight and Habitat Ground Control mice were exposed to mold in their food to unknown relative degrees. The Vivarium Control and Baseline Control mice had clean food throughout their habitation. Loose food bars: Food bars came loose and fell to the bottom of the cage for the HGC mice and was free floating for the Spaceflight mice. This did not prevent the mice from eating. This may have caused some degree of stress for these animals that would have been experienced differently between the Spaceflight and HGC groups. Live animal return: Because weather in the Pacific was very poor, mice experienced double density housing (10 per cage instead of 5) for at least 7 days instead of the expected 2-3 days. Habitat Ground Control mice were treated the same way but this duration of double-density housing probably created additional stress on both groups of mice. In addition, because of rough seas, the Spaceflight mice might have experienced some sea sickness-type conditions that would not have been experienced by the HGC mice. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). GeneLab only processed 68 and 77 samples from LAR and ISS-T groups, respectively, in this dataset for a total of 145 processed samples.     Live Animal Return (LAR) samples: Mice were anesthetized with gas anesthesia and euthanized by means of cardiac puncture blood draw (exsanguination) and double thoracotomy. Fecal samples and other tissues were removed and preserved using liquid nitrogen after euthanasia. All groups (baseline, flight, habitat and vivarium ground controls) were treated identically. All samples were maintained at -80C or lower temperatures throughout the storage during transportation and shipment. ISS Terminal (ISS-T) samples: Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and euthanized by means of cardiac puncture blood draw (exsanguination) and double thoracotomy. The carcass was then wrapped in foil and frozen in MELFI on board the ISS or in ground -80C freezers. Carcasses were maintained at -80C or lower temperatures throughout the storage on board the ISS, in ground freezers and during transportation and shipment. For fecal sample collection, carcasses were thawed at room temperature one at a time (staggered) until the tissues were sufficiently pliable for dissection (approximately 60-90 minutes). Once thawed, tissues were removed from each carcass and preserved using liquid nitrogen. All samples were maintained at -80C or lower temperatures throughout the storage in ground freezers and during transportation and shipment.     DNA was extracted using the Maxwell RSC Purefood GMO and Authentication Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) following GeneLab SOP 3.3 Feces DNA Extraction using Maxwell RSC instrument with PureFood GMO kit. 0.5-2 fecal pellet(s) (based on amount in tube and mass of pellet range 10-15 mg) was/were placed into a tube with 1 mL CTAB solution and homogenized using tissue homogenizing bead mix (Navy RINO Lysis, Next Advance, Raymertown, NY) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance, Raymertown, NY) for 3 minutes at 4 ˚C following GeneLab SOP 2.1 Tissue homogenization using Bullet Blender Bead Beater. Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 4 ˚C and 21,000 g to deflate foam. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA following the manufacturer's protocol. DNA was eluted in 60-140 µL RNAse free H2O (60-120 used for LAR sample extraction in 2023 because of low DNA yield, higher DNA yield in 2024 resulted in use of 130-140 uL H2O) and was further cleaned using OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). Concentrations for all DNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit DNA HS kit following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. DNA quality and size were assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with Agilent gDNA ScreenTape Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP 4.2 QC Genomic DNA. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     DNA library was prepared with the Illumina DNA Library Prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab. Input DNA were approximately 100-500 ng. All libraries (Preps 2-5) were prepared entirely on the epMotion, except for Prep 1, for which the epMotion had an error and the library cleanup step was done manually. Index adapters were IDT for Illumina, 96-well DNA Dual Index Adapters, set C, and Nextera DNA UD Indexes, Plate C. 5 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit. For all prep batches except for Prep 1, the average library fragment sizes were assessed as being too large (~700 to greater than 900 bp), and several manual cleanups (0.4-0.6x bead:sample ratios on a few samples were tested, 0.55x ratio used for most samples) were performed to correct library size to a sequencable range (average of 641 bp). Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) following GeneLab SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Libraries were pooled and balanced based on read count. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     DNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as following: Read 1: 251 bp, Index1: 10 bp, Index2: 10 bp Read 2: 251 bp. PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     Human reads were identified and removed from the raw data as described in GL-DPPD-7105-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Metagenomics/Remove_human_reads_from_raw_data/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7105_Versions/GL-DPPD-7105-A.md). In short, human reads were identified and removed from the raw data using kraken2 (v2.1.1) against a human genome reference database that was constructed from NCBI's RefSeq (GCF_000001405.39) GRCh38.p13. The database was constructed by running kraken build with the following parameters: --no-masking, kmer-length 35, and minimizer-length 31.     Non-human reads were assessed for the percent mouse reads as described in GL-DPPD-7109 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Metagenomics/Estimate_host_reads_in_raw_data/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7109_Versions/GL-DPPD-7109.md). In short, mouse reads were classified and quantitated from the non-human reads using kraken2 (v2.1.1) against a mouse genome reference database that was constructed from NCBI's RefSeq (GCF_000001635.27) GRCm39. The database was constructed by running kraken build with the following parameters: --no-masking, kmer-length 35, and minimizer-length 31.     Human reads removed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.17) was used to generate MultiQC reports.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "All Veggie pillows were assembled at Kennedy Space Center, FL and prepared for flight as described in detail by Massa et al., 2017. Crop seeds were sanitized using a bleach/ hydrochloric acid (HCl) fuming method. Approximately 75–100 seeds were batch sanitized by adding 0.5 ml concentrated HCl to 30 ml bleach (5% sodium hypochlorite solution) in a 500 ml wide-mouth jar and placing an open petri dish containing the seeds into the bleach container, without submersion, then sealing the container to maintain the chlorine fumes around the seeds. Seeds were sanitized for 1 h before being removed from the acid/bleach container for off-gassing overnight (approximately 24 h) in a laminar flow hood. Two seeds were planted in Veggie pillows in calcined clay (arcillite)  and 7.5 g/ liter− 1 of 18–6-8, type 100-day time-release fertilizer (Nutricote Florikan ESA, Sarasota, FL, United States). Seeds were germinated and grown in controlled-environment growth chambers simulating environmental conditions aboard the ISS (50% relative humidity, 3000-ppm CO2, temperature 23 C). The photoperiod was set at 16 h/8 h light dark cycles with LED lights providing 200–300 μmol m− 2 s− 1 photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). During VEG-03D operation, a fan anomaly occurred, causing a rise in humidity to 100% for approximately 25 days inside the Veggie facility and condensation on the bellows surface.     Pillows were thinned to a single plant per pillow . Four harvests were completed.  Samples from harvest 2 and 4 were frozen and returned for analysis. Plant tissues were separated into leaf and root and placed in pre-weighed 50-ml tubes containing sterile water and glass beads and analyzed for microbial load using culture based and molecular methods. Surface swab samples were collected by the crew from 8 different sites within or on the Veggie facility using self-contained sterile swabs (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), three from the interior bellows, one from the upper one-third of the bellows, one in the middle, and the third from the lower portion, three plant pillow top surfaces, one from the internal fan screen, and one from the fan outlet vent ports. After sample collection, the swabs were returned to the sterile container and stored frozen at -80 C in the Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer on ISS (MELFI).     DNA was isolated from each sample using the Qiagen Cell Kit and was followed by PCR  for the 16S rRNA gene for bacteria and barcoded primers for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) for fungi.     Samples were diluted to 4 nM and an equimolar concentration library was created per Illumina’s library preparation guidelines. The library was spiked with a 10% PhiX aliquot to add diversity to the library.     Sequencing was completed using the Illumina MicroSeq V2500 cycle  kits. Sequencing was completed as paired end on the Illumina MiSeq Next Generation Sequencer (NGS). FastQ sequences were identified to the genus level using the RDP/GreenGenes and SILVA (bacteria) and Unite (fungal) databases.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.",

This studies also stresses the food safety component of fresh crops grown on the ISS. The VEG-03D technology demonstration was completed achieving simultaneous multi-species plant growth within a Veggie unit on the International Space Station (ISS). Microbiological characterization using molecular and culture-based methods was performed on leaves and roots from two harvests of three leafy greens, red romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. ‘Outredgeous’); mizuna mustard, (Brassica rapa var japonica); and green leaf lettuce, (Lactuca sativa cv. Waldmann’s) and associated rooting pillow components and Veggie chamber surfaces. Culture based enumeration and pathogen screening indicated the leafy greens were safe for consumption. Surface samples of the Veggie facility and plant pillows revealed low counts of bacteria and fungi and are commonly isolated on ISS. Community analysis was completed with 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Comparisons between pillow components, and plant tissue types from VEG-03D, E, and F revealed higher diversity in roots and rooting substrate than the leaves and wick. This work provides valuable information for food production-related research on the ISS and the impact of the plant microbiome on this unique closed environment.",

This studies also stresses the food safety component of fresh crops grown on the ISS. The VEG-03F technology demonstration took place within a Veggie unit on the International Space Station (ISS). Microbiological characterization using molecular methods was performed on leaves and roots from one harvest of red romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. ‘Outredgeous’) and associated rooting pillow components and Veggie chamber surfaces. Culture based enumeration and pathogen screening indicated the leafy greens were safe for consumption. Surface samples of the Veggie facility and plant pillows revealed low counts of bacteria and fungi and are commonly isolated on ISS. Community analysis was completed with 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Comparisons between pillow components, and plant tissue types from VEG-03D, E, and F revealed higher diversity in roots and rooting substrate than the leaves and wick. This work provides valuable information for food production-related research on the ISS and the impact of the plant microbiome on this unique closed environment.",

Samples were diluted to 4 nM and an equimolar concentration library was created per Illumina’s library preparation guidelines. The library was spiked with a 10% PhiX aliquot to add diversity to the library.     Sequencing was completed using the Illumina MicroSeq V2500 cycle kits. Sequencing was completed as paired end on the Illumina MiSeq Next Generation Sequencer (NGS) with 250-bp paired ends and FASTQ reads at greater than 30 quality score.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.     All Veggie pillows were assembled at Kennedy Space Center, FL and prepared for flight as described in detail by Massa et al., 2017. Crop seeds were sanitized using a bleach/ hydrochloric acid (HCl) fuming method. Approximately 75–100 seeds were batch sanitized by adding 0.5 ml concentrated HCl to 30 ml bleach (5% sodium hypochlorite solution) in a 500 ml wide-mouth jar and placing an open petri dish containing the seeds into the bleach container, without submersion, then sealing the container to maintain the chlorine fumes around the seeds. Seeds were sanitized for 1 h before being removed from the acid/bleach container for off-gassing overnight (approximately 24 h) in a laminar flow hood. Two seeds were planted in Veggie pillows in calcined clay (arcillite) and 7.5 g/ liter− 1 of 18–6-8, type 100-day time-release fertilizer (Nutricote Florikan ESA, Sarasota, FL, United States). Seeds were germinated and grown in controlled environmental conditions aboard the ISS (50% relative humidity, 3000-ppm CO2, temperature 23 C). The photoperiod was set at 16 h/8 h light dark cycles with LED lights providing 200–300 μmol m− 2 s− 1 photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).     Pillows were thinned to a single plant , grown for 28 days and 3 additional harvests were completed.  Plants were harvested as multiple harvests with samples collected and placed in the -80 ° C until returned to Earth. Samples were maintained at -80 until processing. Plants were separated into leaf and root tissue, and 3 samples of media, and wick were collected. All harvests were completed using aseptic techniques to minimize contamination. Plant tissues were separated into leaf and root and placed in pre-weighed 50-ml tubes containing sterile water and glass beads.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "DNA, RNA and proteins were isolated from each sample using the QIAGEN AllPrep DNA/RNA/Protein Kit (QIAGEN, cat  47054) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, yet omitting steps one and two. In order to lyse biological material from each sample, 350uL of each sample was transferred to a QIAGEN PowerBead Tubes with 0.1mm glass beads and secured to a Vortex-Genie 2 using an adapter (cat 1300-V1-24) before being homogenized for 10 minutes. 350uL of the subsequent lysate was then transferred to a spin-column before proceeding with the protocol. Concentration of the isolated DNA, RNA and protein for each sample were measured by fluorometric quantitation using the Qubit 4 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat  Q33238) and a corresponding assay kit.  The Qubit 1Xds DNA HS Assay Kit for DNA concentration (cat  Q33231), the RNA HS Assay Kit (cat  Q32855) for RNA concentration.     Illumina DNA Library prep kit was used for preparing all extracted DNA samples for Illumina Whole genome sequencing per manufacturer’s instructions. Adapters used were IDT® for Illumina® DNA/RNA UD Indexes, Tagmentation (96 Indexes, 96 Samples).     All libraries were pooled and sequenced on a S4 flow cell of the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System with 2 × 150 bp paired-end reads.     Utilizing kraken2 v2.1.1, a human genome reference database was constructed from NCBI's RefSeq (GCF_000001405.39) GRCh38.p13, with --no-masking, and defaults of kmer-length 35 and minimizer-length of 31. FASTQ files were screened against this database, and all successfully classified reads were removed.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.     Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.11. Quality-trimming and filtering was performed with bbmap v38.86. Read-based processing was performed with humann v3.6. Individual samples were assembled with megahit v1.2.9. Genes were called with prodigal v2.6.3. Taxonomic classification of genes and contigs was performed with CAT v5.2.2. Functional annotation was done with KOFamScan v1.3.0. Reads were mapped to assemblies with bowtie2 v2.3.5.1, and coverage information was extracted for reads and contigs with samtools v1.9 and bbmap v38.86. Binning of contigs was performed with metabat2 v2.15. Bins were summarized with bit v1.8.53 and estimates of quality were generated with checkm v1.1.3. High-quality bins (greater than 90% est. completeness and less than 10% est. redundancy) were taxonomically classified with gtdb-tk v1.5.0.     For library preparation, total RNA samples were sent to Hudson Alpha. Samples were treated with DNAse 1 (Zymo Research, Catalog   E1010). Post-DNAse digested samples were then put into the NEBNext rRNA depletion v2 (Human/Mouse/Rat), Ultra II Directional RNA (10 ng), and Unique Dual Index Primer Pairs were used following the vendor protocols from New England Biolabs. Completed libraries were quantified by Qubit or equivalent and run on a Bioanalyzer or equivalent for size determination. Libraries were pooled and quantified by Qubit fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific), TapeStation 2200 (Agilent), and qRT-PCR using the Kapa Biosystems Illumina library quantification kit.     All libraries were pooled and sequenced on a S4 flow cell of the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System with 2 × 150 bp paired-end reads.     Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.17) was used to generate the raw MultiQC report.     All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented for data and sample sharing. We sequenced analyzed samples from human skin, oral, and nasal, environmental swabs before, during, and after a 3-day mission to space.     Body swabs were collected from ten different sites, comprising three microbial ecosystems (oral, nasal, skin) around the body at eight different timepoints surrounding launch. These are referred to as L-92, L-44, L-3, FD1, FD2, R+1, R+45, R+82, where “L-” refers to pre-launch, “FD” corresponds to flight day (i.e., mid-flight), “R” refers to recovery (i.e., post-flight). Open air control, swab water control, laboratory control are also collected. The crew were each provided sterile Isohelix Buccal Mini Swabs (Isohelix, cat MS-03) and 1.0mL dual-barcoded screw-top tubes (Thermo Scientific, cat 3741-WP1D-BR/1.0mL) prefilled with 400uL of DNA/RNA Shield storage preservative (Zymo Research, cat  R1100). Isohelix swabs were dipped in nuclease-free water (on-Earth) or Hfactor hydrogen infused water (in-flight). Eight skin swab sites: post-auricular, axillary vault, volar forearm, occiput, umbilicus, gluteal crease, glabella, and the toe-web space. Following sample collection, swabs were immediately transferred to the barcoded screw-top tubes and kept at room temperature for less than 4 days before being stored at 4C until processing.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "DNA was extracted from 25 mg dust samples before and after incubations using a DNeasy Powerlyzer Power Soil Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with a modified bead mixture (1 g garnet, 0.3 g 100 µm glass beads, and 0.1 g 500 µm beads). Each DNA extraction run included a blank and confirmed to contain no microbial DNA. A total of 50 µL of DNA extract was collected for each sample and stored at -20℃ until use.     Amplicon library preparation used the standard two-step approach recommended by Illumina for generating libraries and was performed by RTL Genomics (Lubbock, TX, USA). Fungal primers: ITS1F (CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA) and ITS2aR (GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC). ribosomal DNA primers - Bacterial primers: 515F (5’-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTA) and 806R (5’-GGACTACHVHHHTWTCTAAT).     All sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq (TM) using a read length of 2 x 300 base pairs.     - Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology 2 (QIIME2), version 2021.8, was used to analyze raw FASTQ sequencing data For fungal sequences: - Primers and spacers were trimmed using the Cutadapt plug-in - Paired-ends joined using the VSEARCH join-pairs method - Sequences were trimmed to a Phred score of 30 with a 3 low-quality base window using the Quality-filter plugin - Sequences were clustered using the vsearch open reference method with Unite database reference sequences (version 9.0) - The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) version 2.9.0, User-friendly Nordic Internal Transcribed spacer Ectomycorrhiza (UNITE) 2019 database, and Fungal High-throughput Taxonomic tool for use with Next-Generation Sequencing (FHitINGS) version 1.4 were used to identify fungal taxonomy For bacterial sequences: - Sequences were run through the Dada2 pipeline - Sequences were clustered by phylogeny - Bacterial taxa was classified in QIIME2 using the feature-classifier plugin which utilized the Greengenes database version 13_8     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.     ISS Dust Samples: All dust used in this study was obtained from vacuum bags (CELOC hypoallergenic filter system Oreck  PKBB12DW) from the vacuum onboard the ISS which astronauts use to clean the HEPA filter coverings that are part of the air ventilation system. It is important to note that we had no control of when, how much, or where these vacuums were used while onboard, which means other areas may have also been vacuumed in addition to the HEPA filter coverings. In total, ISS dust from 4 separate vacuum bags were returned to Earth and analyzed in this study. ISS vacuum bags 1-4 were collected by the ISS crew on GMT 264 (September 21, 2018), GMT 102 (April 12, 2019), GMT 243 (August 31, 2019), and GMT 286 (October 13, 2019) and returned to Earth on SpaceX16 (January 13, 2019), SpaceX-17 (July 3, 2019), and SpaceX-19 (January 7, 2020). In total, it took approximately 6, 5, 6, and 4 months for bags 1, 2, 3, and 4 to reach our lab at OSU from the actual collection date onboard ISS. For ISS vacuum bag 1, the full vacuum bag was sent directly to The Ohio State University Indoor Environmental Quality Laboratory. ISS vacuum bags 2-4 were first sent to the Toxicology and Environmental Chemistry group at NASA’s Johnson Space Center (Houston, TX, USA) and then a subsample of dust was sent to us for analyses. In addition, we received dust samples which were frozen onboard the ISS, returned in cold stowage, and sent directly to our laboratory, where they were stored at -80°C until use.\n\nIncubations: All incubation were completed in a sterilized 3.8 L glass chamber and placed in a VWR incubator (Model TFFU20F2QWA Radnor, PA USA) set to 25°C. Sodium chloride (NaCl) and Magnesium Chloride (MgCl2) solutions were used to simulate 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, and 90% ERH conditions. Deionized (DI) water alone was used to create 100% ERH conditions. Salt solutions were measured for water activity (aw) using an Aqualab™ Dew Point Water Activity Meter (Decagon 125 Devices Pullman, WA USA) and adjusted as needed. All incubation chambers contained approximately 50 mL of salt solution or DI for the desired ERH condition and an Onset® HOBO® Data logger (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA USA) to monitor Equilibrium Relative Humidity (ERH) and temperature. Dust samples were not sieved and measure out into approximately 25 mg portions that were placed on sterile aluminum foil on a plastic dish. Two-week incubations consisted of triplicate samples for each ISS bag and ERH condition (3 samples from each bag per incubation chamber) similar to previous studies. Time-of-wetness incubations followed a procedure previously outlined. Time-of-wetness refers to the time fraction per day that relative humidity conditions are above the 80% threshold. This framework was applied to microbial growth in ISS dust by calculating the relative growth rates at days 5, 10, 14, and 21 at elevated (85% ERH) and saturated (100% ERH) conditions which cycled between 50% ERH for 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours during separate incubations. To obtain the relative growth rate (R/k), we first calculated the growth rates (k) for constant (24 hours/day) elevated and saturated conditions. Next, the effective growth rates (R) were calculated for each condition (elevated and saturated) at 6-, 12-, and 18-hour time points. The relative growth rate was calculated for each bag at each time-of-wetness first, then these values were averaged to obtain the averaged maximum relative growth rate for each time point and ERH condition. Samples were extracted and quantified at days 5, 10, 14, and 21 after incubation (One 25 mg dust sample per day per bag). All incubation chambers were covered with parafilm to retain ERH conditions and allow CO2 to escape.",

          "Study Description": "On Earth, people spend 90% of their time indoors where dust and moisture can facilitate rapid microbial growth, especially fungi. The International Space Station is a specialized closed environment that contains own unique indoor microbiome. Elevated moisture such as from a temporary ventilation system malfunction may lead to unintended microbial growth indoors, which is associated with negative health outcomes and degradation of essential built environment materials. We need to develop a predictive approach for modeling microbial growth to understand when it may occur in these critical indoor spaces. Here we demonstrate that exposure to even fluctuating elevated relative humidity above 80% can lead to rapid microbial growth and community composition changes in dust from spacecraft. We were able to model fungal growth in space station dust using the time-of-wetness framework with activation and deactivation limited growth occurring at 85% and 100% relative humidity conditions, respectively. Alpha and beta diversity of fungi was altered with both significantly decreasing as relative humidity and time elevated increased. Our results demonstrate that we can use moisture conditions to develop predictive models for fungal growth and composition. Understanding microbial growth in spacecraft can protect astronaut health, spacecraft integrity, and promote planetary protection as human activity increases in low-Earth orbit, the moon, Mars, and beyond.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "DNA, RNA and proteins were isolated from each sample using the QIAGEN AllPrep DNA/RNA/Protein Kit (QIAGEN, cat 47054) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, yet omitting steps one and two. In order to lyse biological material from each sample, 350uL of each sample was transferred to a QIAGEN PowerBead Tubes with 0.1mm glass beads and secured to a Vortex-Genie 2 using an adapter (cat 1300-V1-24) before being homogenized for 10 minutes. 350uL of the subsequent lysate was then transferred to a spin-column before proceeding with the protocol. Concentration of the isolated DNA, RNA and protein for each sample were measured by fluorometric quantitation using the Qubit 4 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat Q33238) and a corresponding assay kit. The Qubit 1Xds DNA HS Assay Kit for DNA concentration (cat Q33231), the RNA HS Assay Kit (cat Q32855) for RNA concentration.     For library preparation, total RNA samples were sent to Hudson Alpha. Samples were treated with DNAse 1 (Zymo Research, Catalog E1010). Post-DNAse digested samples were then put into the NEBNext rRNA depletion v2 (Human/Mouse/Rat), Ultra II Directional RNA (10 ng), and Unique Dual Index Primer Pairs were used following the vendor protocols from New England Biolabs. Completed libraries were quantified by Qubit or equivalent and run on a Bioanalyzer or equivalent for size determination. Libraries were pooled and quantified by Qubit fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific), TapeStation 2200 (Agilent), and qRT-PCR using the Kapa Biosystems Illumina library quantification kit.     All libraries were pooled and sequenced on a S4 flow cell of the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System with 2 × 150 bp paired-end reads.     Utilizing kraken2 v2.1.1, a human genome reference database was constructed from NCBI's RefSeq (GCF_000001405.39) GRCh38.p13, with --no-masking, and defaults of kmer-length 35 and minimizer-length of 31. FASTQ files were screened against this database, and all successfully classified reads were removed.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.     All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented for data and sample sharing. We sequenced analyzed samples from human skin, oral, nasal and environmental swabs before, during, and after a 3-day mission to space.     The crew collected biospecimen samples before, during, and after flight. One of these biospecimen collections included microbial swabs collected from nine surfaces in the Dragon capsule (execute button, G-meter button, control touch screen - left, control touch screen - right, side hatch mobility aid, lid of waste locker, seat 2, commode panel, viewing dome) and one open air control. Swabs were collected twice during flight (flight day 2 (FD2), and flight day 3 (FD3)) and twice pre-flight in the crew training capsule in Hawthorne, CA (L-92, L-44). Isohelix swabs were dipped in nuclease-free water (on-Earth) or Hfactor hydrogen infused water (in-flight). Areas of the SpaceX Dragon Capsule were swabbed for 30 seconds using both sides of the swab. Swabs were then stored in 400uL of Zymo Research DNA/RNA Shield (cat  1100) and kept at room temperature for less than 4 days before being stored at 4C until processing.     Illumina DNA Library prep kit was used for preparing all extracted DNA samples for Illumina Whole genome sequencing per manufacturer’s instructions. Adapters used were IDT® for Illumina® DNA/RNA UD Indexes, Tagmentation (96 Indexes, 96 Samples).     All libraries were pooled and sequenced on a S4 flow cell of the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System with 2 × 150 bp paired-end reads.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.     Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.11. Quality-trimming and filtering was performed with bbmap v38.86. Read-based processing was performed with humann v3.6. Individual samples were assembled with megahit v1.2.9. Genes were called with prodigal v2.6.3. Taxonomic classification of genes and contigs was performed with CAT v5.2.2. Functional annotation was done with KOFamScan v1.3.0. Reads were mapped to assemblies with bowtie2 v2.3.5.1, and coverage information was extracted for reads and contigs with samtools v1.9 and bbmap v38.86. Binning of contigs was performed with metabat2 v2.15. Bins were summarized with bit v1.8.53 and estimates of quality were generated with checkm v1.1.3. High-quality bins (greater than 90% est. completeness and less than 10% est. redundancy) were taxonomically classified with gtdb-tk v1.5.0.",

For fecal collection, all subjects are provided with DNA Genotek OMNIgene-GUT (OM-200) kits for gut microbiome DNA collection. Each subject was instructed to empty their bladder and collect a fecal sample free of urine and toilet water. From the fecal specimen, each subject used a sterile single-use spatula, provided by the OMNIgene-GUT kit, to collect the feces and deposit it into the OMIgene-GUT tube. Once deposited and sealed, the user was instructed to shake the sealed tube for 30 seconds in order to homogenize the sample and release the storage buffer. All samples from each timepoint were stored at room temperature for less than 3 days before storing at -80°C long-term.

OMNIgene-GUT tubes thawed on ice (4°C) and vortexed for 10 seconds before transferring 400uL of homogenized feces into the QIAGEN PowerBead Pro Tube with 0.1mm glass beads and secured to a Vortex-Genie 2 using an adapter (cat  1300-V1-24) before being homogenized at maximum speed for 10 minutes. The remainder of the protocol was completed as instructed by the manufacturer. The concentration of the isolated DNA was measured by fluorometric quantitation using the Qubit 4 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat  Q33238), and the Qubit 1Xds DNA Broad Range Assay Kit was used for DNA concentration (cat  Q33265).     For shotgun metagenomic sequencing, library preparation for Illumina NGS platforms was performed using the Illumina DNA FLEX Library prep kit (cat  20018705) with IDT for Illumina DNA/RNA US Indexes (cat  20060059).     Following library preparation, quality control was assessed using a BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent, cat  G2939BA) and the High Sensitivity DNA assay. All libraries were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 2000 Sequencing System with 2 × 150 bp paired-end reads.     Utilizing kraken2 v2.1.1, a human genome reference database was constructed from NCBI's RefSeq (GCF_000001405.39) GRCh38.p13, with --no-masking, and defaults of kmer-length 35 and minimizer-length of 31. FASTQ files were screened against this database, and all successfully classified reads were removed.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.     Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.11. Quality-trimming and filtering was performed with bbmap v38.86. Read-based processing was performed with humann v3.6. Individual samples were assembled with megahit v1.2.9. Genes were called with prodigal v2.6.3. Taxonomic classification of genes and contigs was performed with CAT v5.2.2. Functional annotation was done with KOFamScan v1.3.0. Reads were mapped to assemblies with bowtie2 v2.3.5.1, and coverage information was extracted for reads and contigs with samtools v1.9 and bbmap v38.86. Binning of contigs was performed with metabat2 v2.15. Bins were summarized with bit v1.8.53 and estimates of quality were generated with checkm v1.1.3. High-quality bins (higher than 90% est. completeness and lower than 10% est. redundancy) were taxonomically classified with gtdb-tk v1.5.0.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Collected skin was flash embedded in OCT blocks. Three or 4 replicate OCT-embedded tissues were placed on a single slide per patient including pre and post flight replicates.     Immunofluorescent visualization marker for Pan-Cytokeratin (PanCK, Novus cat  NBP2-33200,  Alexa Fluor® 532, clone ID AE1 + AE3), fibroblast activation protein (FAP, Abcam cat  ab222924, Alexa Fluor® 594, clone ID EPR20021) and smooth muscle actin (SMA, R and D Systems cat  IC1420R, Alexa Fluor® 647, clone 1A4) were used for region or interest (ROI) selection. The DSP whole transcriptome assay (WTA) was used to assess genes collected in each ROI. For DSP processing, OCT slides were thawed overnight in 10% NBF at 4°C followed by PBS washes for thorough fixation.  After washes, slides were prepared following the automated Leica Bond RNA Slide Preparation Protocol for fixed frozen samples, digesting samples with 1.0 µg/mL protease K for 15 min, and antigen retrieval for 20 min at 100°C (NanoString, no. MAN-10115-05). In situ hybridizations with the GeoMx Whole Transcriptome Atlas Panel (WTA, v1.0, 18,677 genes) at 4 nM final concentration were done in Buffer R (NanoString). Morphology markers were prepared for four slides concurrently using Syto13 (DNA), PanCK, FAP and SMA in Buffer W for a total volume of 225 μl per slide. Slides incubated with 225 μl of morphology marker solution at RT for 1 h, then washed in SSC and loaded onto the NanoString DSP instrument. The No Template Control was used to detect contamination in the library prep.     Libraries were constructed with Illumina adapters for paired end sequencing.     Libraries were sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer.     Images were captured using the NanoString GeoMx system. The 20x scan was used to select freeform ROIs to guide selection of outer epidermal (OE), inner epidermal (IE), outer dermal (OD) and vascular (VA) regions.     FASTQ files were converted to digital count conversion files using the NanoString GeoMx NGS DnD Pipeline (v2.3.4). From the normalized count matrix, DESeq2 (v1.34.0) was used to perform differential expression analysis.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.     DNA and RNA were extracted with the Qiagen Allprep Bacterial DNA/RNA/Protein Kit (cat  47054).     For library preparation, total RNA samples were sent to Hudson Alpha. Samples were treated with DNAse 1 (Zymo Research, Catalog   E1010). Post-DNAse digested samples were then put into the NEBNext rRNA depletion v2 (Human/Mouse/Rat), Ultra II Directional RNA (10 ng), and Unique Dual Index Primer Pairs were used following the vendor protocols from New England Biolabs. Completed libraries were quantified by Qubit or equivalent and run on a Bioanalyzer or equivalent for size determination. Libraries were pooled and quantified by Qubit fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific), TapeStation 2200 (Agilent), and qRT-PCR using the Kapa Biosystems Illumina library quantification kit.     Libraries were sequenced using 2 x 150 Paired end sequencing on an S4 flow cell using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer.     Utilizing kraken2 v2.1.1, a human genome reference database was constructed from NCBI's RefSeq (GCF_000001405.39) GRCh38.p13, with --no-masking, and defaults of kmer-length 35 and minimizer-length of 31. FASTQ files were screened against this database, and all successfully classified reads were removed.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.     Illumina DNA Library prep kit was used for preparing all extracted DNA samples for Illumina Whole genome sequencing per manufacturer’s instructions. Adapters used were IDT® for Illumina® DNA/RNA UD Indexes, Tagmentation (96 Indexes, 96 Samples).     Libraries were sequenced using 2 x 150 Paired end sequencing on an S4 flow cell using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.     Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.11. Quality-trimming and filtering was performed with bbmap v38.86. Read-based processing was performed with humann v3.6. Individual samples were assembled with megahit v1.2.9. Genes were called with prodigal v2.6.3. Taxonomic classification of genes and contigs was performed with CAT v5.2.2. Functional annotation was done with KOFamScan v1.3.0. Reads were mapped to assemblies with bowtie2 v2.3.5.1, and coverage information was extracted for reads and contigs with samtools v1.9 and bbmap v38.86. Binning of contigs was performed with metabat2 v2.15. Bins were summarized with bit v1.8.53 and estimates of quality were generated with checkm v1.1.3. High-quality bins (greater than 90% est. completeness and less than 10% est. redundancy) were taxonomically classified with gtdb-tk v1.5.0.     All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented for data and sample sharing.     Skin biopsies were performed on the deltoid region of the arm from the L-44 and R+1 timepoint. Each site was prepared by application of ChloraPrep and anesthesia was induced with administration of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine. A trephine punch was used to remove a 3- or 4-mm diameter piece of skin. The resected piece was cut into approximately ⅓ and ⅔ sections. The larger piece was placed in a cryovial and stored at -80°C for spatial transcriptomics. One-third of the sample was stored in formalin and kept at room temperature to perform histology. Skin swabs: Isohelix swabs were dipped in nuclease-free water. Swabs were then stored in 400uL of Zymo Research DNA/RNA Shield (cat 1100).",

Samples were then embedded in OCT and prepared for spatially resolved transcriptomics using the NanoString GeoMx Whole Transcriptome Atlas Panel. Skin was profiled in four regions: outer epidermis (OE), inner epidermis (IE), outer dermis (OD), and vasculature (VA) regions. Four crew members were profiled pre-fight (C001, C002, C003, C004) and three crew members were profiled post-flight (C002, C003,  C004). Additionally, skin swabs of the deltoid region were collected before each biopsy. Skin swabs were first dipped in nuclease-free water before swabbing each region for 30 seconds.

          "Study Protocol Description": "One fecal pellet (equivalent in mass) was used per mouse for DNA extraction and bacterial DNA was isolated using the QIAGEN Power Fecal DNA isolation kit (QIAGEN, Cat. No. 12955-4) with bead beating. Total DNA isolated for 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was also utilized for metagenomic sequencing. Oral samples collected via Plasdent Maxaplicator Super fine (2 mm) swabs were used for collection (MPN 600-R-2). Oral Swab DNA samples were processed using the Lucigen - Master Pure DNA isolation kit (Ca. No. MC85200).     Whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing was performed at the University of Washington's Northwest Genomics Center (NWGC) on 10 biological replicates for both ISS and ISS_G rodents respectively (N equals 20). Sequencing libraries were generated using KAPA HTP Library Preparation Kits (07961901001, Roche) and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 System using a S Prime flow cell configured for 300 cycles which resulted in a total of 1,342,813,654 reads with an average of 70,674,403 reads per sample. Raw paired-end reads were then filtered, trimmed for quality, and screened against a mouse (C57BL) reference database using kneadData (McIver et al., 2018).     Utilizing kraken2 v2.1.1, a human genome reference database was constructed from NCBI's RefSeq (GCF_000001405.39) GRCh38.p13, with --no-masking, and defaults of kmer-length 35 and minimizer-length of 31. FASTQ files were screened against this database, and all successfully classified reads were removed.     Utilizing kraken2 v2.1.1, a mouse genome reference database was constructed from NCBI's RefSeq (GCF_000001635.27) GRCm39, with --no-masking, and defaults of kmer-length 35 and minimizer-length of 31. FASTQ files were screened against this database, and all successfully classified reads were counted and reported as a percentage of the total.     Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.11. Quality-trimming and filtering was performed with bbmap v38.86. Read-based processing was performed with humann v3.6. Individual samples were assembled with megahit v1.2.9. Genes were called with prodigal v2.6.3. Taxonomic classification of genes and contigs was performed with CAT v5.2.2. Functional annotation was done with KOFamScan v1.3.0. Reads were mapped to assemblies with bowtie2 v2.3.5.1, and coverage information was extracted for reads and contigs with samtools v1.9 and bbmap v38.86. Binning of contigs was performed with metabat2 v2.15. Bins were summarized with bit v1.8.53 and estimates of quality were generated with checkm v1.1.3. High-quality bins (greater than 90% est. completeness and less than 10% est. redundancy) were taxonomically classified with gtdb-tk v1.5.0.     The sequencing of the V1-V3 region (Allen et al., 2016) of 16S rRNA gene was completed using a custom protocol (F. Escapa et al., 2020) and on the Illumina Mi-Seq platform.     Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7104-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Metagenomics/Illumina/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7107_Versions/GL-DPPD-7107.md), using workflow SW_AmpIllumina v1.0.0 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/SW_AmpIllumina-A_1.0.0/Amplicon/Illumina/Workflow_Documentation/SW_AmpIllumina-A). Quality assessment of filtered reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.9. Primers were already removed from the submitted raw data. The raw data had 101 bp R1 reads and 401 bp R2 reads. Due to relatively poor quality of the R2 reads, and because for many recovered sequences the paired reads did not span the target amplicon (exploration of this can be found in the general-processing-notes.txt file packaged with in the V1V3-processing_info.zip archive), only the R1 reads were processed – which in this case extended into the V3 region back from the reference 518 position. DADA2 v1.20.0 was utilized for quality-trimming and filtering and inference of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), and taxonomy was assigned with DECIPHER v2.20 using the SILVA r138 reference database.     The sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was then performed as previously described (Tong et al., 2014). The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and barcoded using 515f/806r primers then 2x150bp (paired-end) sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Caporaso et al., 2012).     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7104-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Metagenomics/Illumina/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7107_Versions/GL-DPPD-7107.md), using workflow SW_AmpIllumina v1.0.0 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/SW_AmpIllumina-A_1.0.0/Amplicon/Illumina/Workflow_Documentation/SW_AmpIllumina-A). Quality assessment of filtered reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.9. Primers were already removed from the submitted raw data. DADA2 v1.20.0 was utilized for quality-trimming and filtering and inference of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), and taxonomy was assigned with DECIPHER v2.20 using the SILVA r138 reference database.     The analysis of the mouse blood serum metabolome targeted three different classes of molecules that each used different sample preparation and LC-MS/MS protocols: regular polar metabolites (Group 1), carbonic acids (Group 2), and glycols (Group 3). All samples were extracted in a randomized order. First, a stock extract for the three downstream methods was prepared by mixing 5 ul mouse blood serum with 20 ul methanol. The mixtures were precipitated at -20 C for 2 hours, 10 min at 20,000  g and 4 C and supernatants were transferred into new Eppendorf tubes. For regular polar metabolites (Group 1), 2.5 ul extract were mixed with 50 ul 0.1 % (v/v) formic acid, centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 _ g and 4 C, transferred into glass vials, and injected (5 ul) directly into the LC-MS/MS system. Carbonic acids (Group 2) were derivatized using the 2-Hydrazinoquinoline-method established by (Lu et al., 2013). Specifically, 2.5 ul serum extract were mixed with 500 nmol 13C,D4-acetic acid isotope in 50 ul freshly prepared derivatization mix (1 mM 2-hydrazinoquinoline, 1 mM 2,2'-dipyridil disulfide, and 1 mM triphenylphosphine in acetonitrile). The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at 60 C, chilled on ice, and quenched with 50 ul H2O. After centrifugation at 20,000  g and 4 C for 5 min, samples were transferred into glass vials and 10 ul aliquots used for LC-MS/MS-analysis. Glycols (Group 3) were prepared according to (Imbert et al., 2014). 2.5 ul blood serum extracts were spiked with 2.5 nmol D4-1,4-butanediol isotope in 7.5 ul water. Then, 10 ul 4 M NaOH were added and mixed with 5 ul benzoyl chloride followed by 5-minute incubation at room temperature. The derivatization reaction was stopped by adding 5 ul 5 % (w/v) glycine. Samples were vortexed, incubates for 5 min and the glycol derivatives extracted with 200 ul propane. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C and 20,000  g, supernatants transferred into a fresh Eppendorf tube and evaporated in a SpeedVac to complete dryness. After reconstitution in 50 ul buffer (50 % acetonitrile, 50 % water, 10 mM ammonium formate pH 2.5), insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and 10 ul aliquots subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis.     Targeted quantitation was performed on a SCIEX QTRAP 6500 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (SCIEX, Framingham, MA, USA) equipped with an Ion Drive Turbo V ESI source and a Shimadzu Nexera XR HPLC system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Details of the respective HPLC methods and instrument parameters are summarized in Table S15. For polar metabolites (Group 1), a Poroshell 120 EC-C18 (4.6x100 mm, 2.7 um particle size; Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, California)) guarded by a Security Guard Ultra C18 precolumn (Phenomenex, Torrance, California) was used for reverse phase separation as described (Schulte et al., 2020). Derivatized carbonic acids were separated using an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1x50 mm, 1.7 um particle size; Waters Corporation (Milford, Massachusetts)) hyphenated to a KrudKatcher Ultra HPLC In-Line Filter (0.2 um depth x 0.004 inch) as previously described (Lu et al., 2013). Glycol derivatives were separated using an Atlantis dC18 column (2.1 x 150 mm, 3 um particle size; Waters Corp.) protected by a KrudKatcher Ultra HPLC In-Line Filter (0.2 um depth x 0.004 inch) according to (Imbert et al., 2014). The mass spectrometer was optimized for the detection of each molecule to obtain maximum intensity (polarity, collision energy, precursor and product ion selection). Samples were analyzed in randomized order and quality control standards were injected at regular intervals during and between analysis batches to monitor instrument performance (analyte separation and detection). Calibration standards were prepared by serial-dilution of stock solutions containing 64 compounds for polar metabolites, 4 carbonic acids, and 3 glycols. The carbonic acid and glycol standards were derivatized at the same time as the respective sample batches as described above. Calibration curves were collected over a concentration range of 100,000 to 0.0001 nmol using 5 and 10 uL injection volumes. All stock solutions were aliquoted and stored at -20 C until used.     The objective of the Rodent Research-5 (RR-5) study was to evaluate bone loss in mice under microgravity conditions and to determine if treatment with NELL1 can reduce or prevent bone loss that would otherwise occur in microgravity. Bone loss assessments include measuring a combination of blood markers, micro Computed Tomography (uCT), Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA), and bone histomorphometry. Forty mice (female; BALB/c; 30 weeks old; Taconic), launched in two Transporters (20 mice per), then were transferred to Rodent Habitats onboard the International Space Station (ISS) and maintained in microgravity for ~30 days until Live Animal Return (N of 20; LAR to UCLA) or for ~9 weeks total which were ISS Terminal (N of 20; IT). There was a Baseline of subjects at KSC. A Ground Control group mimicked LAR, which was housed at KSC, then shipped live to UCLA. There was a Ground Control group at KSC which mimicked flight. All animals were kept on a temperature controlled (~28C), 12-hr Light/Dark Cycle. There were two treatment groups: control (saline vehicle [10 mg/kg in 0.3 mls], and experimental NELL1 [10 mg/kg in 0.3 mls]). Alizarin red or calcein green bone label markers were administered as well (respectively 50 mg/kg, 0.1 mls and 20 mg/kg, 0.1 mls). Injections of vehicle, NELL1, and bone markers were intraperitoneal (i.p.).  The mice were injected 6-8 days after launch and at two week (+/- 1day) intervals thereafter. During the first set of injections (L+6-8 days), only NELL1 or vehicle was injected (no bone marker). Two or three treatments were administered to all 40 mice on orbit, depending on Dragon berth duration.  Twenty mice, at just prior to Dragon unberth (Spx-11), were transferred to a Dragon and transported live back to Earth (LAR). An additional two treatments were administered to the 20 mice that remained aboard the ISS. The 20 mice kept aboard the ISS, at ~L+4 to 5 weeks, were anesthetized via i.p. injection of ketamine/xylazine, DXA scanned, and then recovered via injection of atipamazole. At L+9 weeks the ISS mice were anesthetized (Ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine) and DXA scanned. Blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture through closed chest. Animals were euthanized by exsanguination and cervical dislocation. One hind limb was dissected from each animal and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF). The NBF was removed and replaced with 70% ethanol after 5-6 days of fixation. The blood was separated by centrifugation, and tubes were frozen and stored at -80C or colder. Each carcass was wrapped in aluminum foil and placed in -80C storage or colder until return. All the samples analyzed in this dataset were collected from saline vehicle treated animals.     Fecal Sample collection: Nominally, two freshly harvested fecal samples or more per mouse (in individual, autoclaved cages) were collected and placed in 2.0 mL sterile, nuclease free (RNAase/DNAase), non-pyrogenic, polypropylene Corning Cyrogenic vials. Samples were promptly flash frozen with liquid nitrogen for 15 minutes - one hour (within 15 minutes or less of collection) and stored in a -80C freezer. One fecal pellet (equivalent in mass) was used per mouse for DNA extraction and sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was then performed as previously described (Tong et al., 2014). Oral Sample collection: The molars, cheeks and tongue (lingual and buccal) regions of the LAR and LAR_G rodents (3 swabs per mouse within each cage) were used as a consistent anatomical position for oral microbiome sampling. The rodents were anesthetized via isoflurane and sampled. Specifically, Plasdent Maxaplicator Super fine (2 mm) swabs were used for collection (MPN 600-R-2). Plasma serum was isolated as described in (Kwak and Zhang et al. 2022)",

The NASA led Rodent Research 5 mission enabled an ancillary investigation of the gut microbiome varying exposure to microgravity (flight) relative to ground controls in the context of previously shown bone mineral density (BMD) loss that was observed in these flight groups. We demonstrate elevated abundance of Lactobacillus murinus and Dorea sp. during microgravity exposure relative to ground control through whole genome sequencing and 16S rRNA analyses. Specific functionally assigned gene clusters of Lactobacillus murinus and Dorea sp. capable of producing metabolites, lactic acid, leucine/isoleucine, and glutathione are enriched. These metabolites are elevated in the microgravity-exposed host serum through LC-MS/MS metabolomic analysis. Along with BMD loss, ELISA analysis reveals increases of osteocalcin and reductions in tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b signifying additional loss of bone homeostasis in flight.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "10 tissue samples were collected from patients presenting with severe diabetic foot ulcers at Mater Dei Hospital, Malta. These samples were collected aseptically during amputation surgery. 5 biofilm samples were also obtained from patients presenting with less severe diabetic foot ulcers at the Floriana Health Centre, Malta, which is a primary Health Care Facility. The biofilm samples were collected aseptically during ulcer debridement as part of the required treatment. 12 skin swabs were obtained from the abovementioned patients, either on the day of debridement or a day after the amputation surgery. The swab was moistened with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and an area of the healthy skin from the contralateral foot was swabbed. The inoculated swab was then placed in PBS and transported to the lab for processing. Three patients were not swabbed as they discharged themselves the day after surgery. The six tissue samples that were chosen for Project Maleth were treated in the following way. Each original tissue sample was further cut into two other pieces. One piece was placed in a cuvette and immersed in Phosphate buffered saline. This tissue, which served as the Earth Control tissue sample, was kept in an incubator at 30C for the whole mission duration. This temperature was equivalent to that found on the ISS. The other piece of tissue was placed in another cuvette and immersed in PBS. The six cuvettes containing the tissue samples were mounted on the IceCube and sent to Cape Canaveral for a SpaceX CRS23 re-supply mission. These will be referred to as the ISS tissue samples. Once on the ISS, the tissues remained in orbit for thirty days until they returned back on Earth. After returning back to Earth, both the samples that were sent to ISS and the control samples were kept at 15-18C in Phosphate buffered saline (the solution that they were in during the experiment). Both the ISS and Earth control tissues were kept at this temperature for a month until the ISS samples arrived in our labs in Malta from the USA. Upon arrival at our labs in Malta, the ISS tissue samples as well as the Earth Control tissue samples, were processed for culture and lysed for DNA extraction.     200µl of the lysed tissue/biofilm or 200µl of PBS from the skin swabs were transferred to an Eppendorf tube and placed in the QIACube for DNA extraction using the QIAamp® DNA Mini kit. After DNA extraction, the DNA concentration was measured with Qubit.\nNegative control samples were processed in the same way to determine and exclude any reagent contamination. The three negative controls consisted of uninoculated PBS, uninoculated RNase/DNase free water and an uninoculated swab that was vortexed in PBS.     After DNA extraction, the samples were processed for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The first PCR was performed by taking 10µl of the 20ng of gDNA and performing the following thermal cycling conditions (98 C for 2 minutes, then 30 cycles of 98 C for 10s, 65oC for 20s and 72 C for 20s. The final extension was at 72 C for 2 minutes). The following primers were used; Forward GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA; Reverse GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT. The Primermix is based on Caparose et al 2011 targeting the V4 region. The second PCR was then performed using the same thermal cycling conditions however, to each different sample a specific barcode tag was added. The samples were then loaded on 1% Agarose gel to check if the samples were amplified to the right size. The samples were then pooled and sample clean-up was performed by magnetic beads. The DNA concentration was then determined again by Qubit and the DNA library was analysed with Agilent Bioanalyzer to determine the size of the basepairs. The band should be between 300-600bp. Finally the pooled DNA library was then denatured and diluted to 4pM. The PhiX library was also denatured and diluted to 4pM.     The amplicon library and the PhiX Control were then combined and loaded into the cartilage. The flowcell and the loaded cartilage were placed in the Illumina MiSeq Next Generation Sequencer for sequencing.     Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.9. Primers were removed with cutadapt v2.3. DADA2 v1.20.0 was utilized for quality-trimming and filtering and inference of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), and taxonomy was assigned with DECIPHER v2.20 using the SILVA r138 reference database.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Twenty (20) mice (female, 10 B6129SF2/J Wild Type (WT) and 10 B6;129S2-Cdkn1atm1Tyj/J (p21-null), 14-15 weeks old) were launched in one Transporter on SpaceX-21 (SpX-21) on December 6, 2020. The Flight (FL) mice were transferred into two Rodent Habitats upon arrival to the International Space Station (ISS) and were maintained in microgravity for 28-29 days. At 7 days before euthanasia (December 26 and 27, 2020), all 20 mice received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection with the bone formation marker (Calcein). At about 48 +/- 2 hours before euthanasia (December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2021), all 20 mice received an IP injection with a second dose of Calcein as well as the cell proliferation marker (BrdU). At approximately 28-29 days in microgravity (January 2 and 3, 2021), the Flight mice were euthanized with a Ketamine/Xylazine cocktail, followed by cardiac puncture and thoracotomy. Following skin removal, both hindlimb quarters were removed and preserved or fixed. Each carcass was wrapped in aluminum foil, preserved in the CryoChiller, and stored at -80C or colder until return to PI. Two other groups of mice, 20 for Ground Control (GC) and 24 for Vivarium Control (VIV), half B6129SF/J Wild Type (WT) and half B6;129S2-Cdkn1atm1Tyj/J (p21-null), were selected by the PI and underwent the same procedures and treatment as the Flight group but with an offset of 3 days. In addition to the IP injections (Calcein and BrdU) described above, all mice in the FL, GC, and VIV groups also received a pre-flight subcutaneous injection of the bone marker (Alizarin Red). Twenty (20) female mice (half WT and half p21-null) were selected by the PI for the Baseline Control (BL) group. Following a successful Launch, baseline animals were injected with Calcein at the time of Launch (7 days prior to dissection) and at 48 +/- 2 hours before dissection. BL animals were also injected with BrdU at 48 +/- 2 hours before dissection. Baseline dissections were performed 7 days after launch following the same procedures used for the Flight animals.     At the end of RR-10 experiment, all frozen carcasses and preserved hindlimbs were returned to the PI. In May 2021, the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) team performed complex, integrated dissections at NASA Ames Research Center with the Principal Investigator team. On the day of the dissection, mouse carcasses were thawed by bringing the carcass out of -80C preservation to room temperature and keeping the carcass in RT for 40 minutes. Once the mouse carcass was thawed enough to manipulate, the dissection started and various tissues were collected. The digestive system was collected from the mouse carcass and transferred on a clean weighting boat to a secondary dissector. Fecal samples were extruded from the colon by creating a small incision in the colon tissue and taking the pellets out using blunt tweezers. Fecal pellets were put in to the preservation tubes and preserved. On average, fecal samples were collected ~11 minutes after dissection began.     DNA was extracted using the Maxwell RSC Purefood GMO and Authentication Kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Half to whole frozen fecal pellet was placed into a tube with 940 uL CTAB solution and homogenized using tissue homogenizing bead mix (Navy RINO Lysis, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 3 minutes at 4C. Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at 10C and 21,000 g to deflate foam. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA following the manufacturer's protocol. DNA was eluted in 75 uL RNAse free H2O and was further cleaned using OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit (Zymo Research). Concentrations for all DNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit DNA HS kit. DNA quality and size were assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with Agilent gDNA ScreenTape Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     DNA library was prepared with the Illumina DNA Prep Library kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab. Input DNA were approximately ~500 ng. Index adapters were IDT for Illumina, 96-well Illumina RNA/ DNA Unique Dual Index Adapters, Set A and Set B. 5 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size ~550 bp was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).  Concentrations for all DNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit DNA HS kit.  Library quality control was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).     DNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Paired end 250bp. PhiX included as control.     Utilizing kraken2 v2.1.1, a human genome reference database was constructed from NCBI's RefSeq (GCF_000001405.39) GRCh38.p13, with --no-masking, and defaults of kmer-length 35 and minimizer-length of 31.

At 48 +/- 2 hours before euthanasia, all 20 mice received an IP injection with a second dose of Calcein as well as a cell proliferation marker (BrdU). Then, following 28-29 days in microgravity, the Flight mice were euthanized. Following removal of hindlimbs, carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, preserved in the CryoChiller, and stored at -80 C or colder until return to Earth. In addition to the Flight group, three ground control groups were also part of the study: Basal (representing the pre-launch state), Vivarium (standard vivarium housing for the same duration of time as flight), and Ground (flight habitat in the International Space Station Environment Simulator, ISSES). Twenty mice (10 of each strain) were included in each of these control groups (except Vivarium which included 12 of each strain). These were treated, euthanized and processed on the same schedule and in the same manner as the flight samples. At the end of RR-10 experiment, all frozen carcasses were partially thawed and fecal pellets were removed and preserved by flash freezing in LN2. DNA was extracted, shotgun metagenome libraries generated, and libraries sequenced (target 10 M clusters at PE 250 bp). This dataset features WT samples from the Flight (n=3), Ground (n=5), Basal (n=10) and Vivarium groups (n=12), as well as p21-null samples from Flight (n=5), Ground (n=5), Basal (n=10) and Vivarium groups (n=12).",

The Flight mice were transferred into two Rodent Habitats upon arrival to the International Space Station (ISS) and were maintained in microgravity for 38 days. The Flight mice were transferred into a Transporter and returned to Earth for Live Animal Return (LAR) on SpX-21 (January 13th, 2021). After Atlantic Ocean splashdown, the LAR Flight mice were transported via helicopter to Kennedy Space Center. Collectively, 20 Flight, 20 HGC, and 20 VGC mice were transferred from Rodent Transporters (Flight and HGC) or vivarium cages (VGC) and placed into shipping containers. All 60 mice were flown via charter plane to the PI’s institution, Texas A and M University (TAMU). All post-flight euthanasia and dissections were performed by the PI team at TAMU. The original plan was to perform all pre-flight and post-flight activities at Roskamp Institute in Sarasota, Florida. Due to the health risks associated with travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, HRP approved all post-flight activities at TAMU, which significantly decreased or eliminated travel for the PI, BSP, and Payload Developer (PD) teams. Upon arrival at the TAMU Animal Care Facility (ACF), the mice underwent post-flight procedures, followed by euthanasia and tissue collection by the PI team.     Fecal pellets were gently pushed out of the descending colon with forceps.  If necessary, colon was wet with saline with a saline wipe before fecal pellets were pushed out using the flat side of the forceps. GeneLab processed 9 samples each from flight/ground control/vivarium control groups in this dataset.

          "Study Protocol Description": "Surface sample collections were conducted using pre-moistened sterile polyester wipes (23 cm x 23 cm; ITW Texwipe, Mahwah, NJ) that were placed in a sterile Ziploc bag. Samples were collected from 8 habitable locations around the ISS during early flight for Flight 4 (F4) and mid-flight on Flight 5 (F5). Collected samples were stored at 4C prior to return.     Samples were processed and concentrated using the InnovaPrep concentration pipettor and divided into two aliquots, one treated with PMA to analyze intact cells, and one not treated with Propidium monoazide (PMA). DNA extraction was performed seperately on the PMA and non-PMA treated samples using the Maxwell 16 System (Promega, Madison, WI) in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer.     DNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using the Nextera Flex DNA Library Preparation Kit (20018705, Illumina). Quality and fragment size were assessed on the Agilent Tapestation 4200 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Libraries were quantitate using the Qubit fluorimeter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and normalized to equivalent DNA quantities where possible, pooled, and diluted according to the manufacturer's standard recommendations.     The Illumina NextSeq 500 was used to shotgun metagenomic sequencing with the NextSeq 500/550 300 cycle High Output Sequencing Kit v2.5 (Catalog number 20024908, Illumina, San Diego, CA), using 150 base pair, paired-end reads.

          "Study Protocol Description": "VEG 03A experiment plants were harvested at two separate dates, Dec 9, 2016 and Dec 28, 2016 as a cut and come again study. Plant leaves were wrapped in aluminum foil and placed in -80C (MELFI) until return. Two plant pillows with root material from each experiment were also frozen at -80C until return. Parallel ground experiments were handled and sampled identical to flight with a 72 hour delay. The final harvest was processed for 16S microbial characterization. This dataset only includes samples harvested on Dec 28, 2016.     Temperature was maintained during the return of tissues to Kennedy Space Center, where they were also maintained at -80C until processing. Plant leaf material was processed immediately upon thawing and pillows containing roots were thawed at 4 - 8C overnight before sampling was completed. All leaf material from the final harvest was divided for chemical, microbiological and molecular analysis. DNA was extracted from plant leaf and root material of the Veggie pillows using the Microbial Cell DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen, Inc, Carlsbad, CA) then quantified using the Qubit 2.0 double stranded DNA assays (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY).     The variable 4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA) was selected as a phylogenetic markers to identify microorganisms taxonomically to the species level. A dual indexing system for multiplexing was adapted for these communities and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was optimized for reagent concentrations and volume. Each community was labeled with two barcoded primers for identification at completion of sequencing. Amplicons were created in triplicate using 1 ng of template DNA in each reaction. After PCR all amplicons were purified using the Min-Elute System (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA) and quantified with the Qubit 2.0 high sensitivity ds DNA assay (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY).     The purified amplicons were then pooled in an equimolar concentration to create the library following Illumina protocols. The sample library was combined with a 10% Phi-X control library to create diversity and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq using a V2 500-cycle kit (Illumina, Inc, San Diego, CA).     Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.9. Primers were removed with cutadapt v2.3. DADA2 v1.20.0 was utilized for quality-trimming and filtering and inference of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), and taxonomy was assigned with DECIPHER v2.20 using the SILVA r138 reference database.     Plants were grown in Veggie pillows containing solid, porous, arcillite (calcined clay) substrate in two different blends, Blend 1: 100% sized to 600 u1 mm or Blend 2: a 1:1 ratio of that size to 1–2 mm (Turface Proleague, Profile Products, LLC) and controlled release fertilizer (Nutricote 18-6-8, type 180, Florikan, Sarasota, FL, United States). Procedures for detailed substrate and pillow preparation are outlined in Massa et al. (2017b). Two surface sanitized seeds were attached with guar in each plant pillow between paired germination wicks. All plant rooting pillows with attached seeds were kept dry in heat sealed, gas-impermeable Tedlar bags until test initiation on the ISS. Seeds for three separate, independent plantings (biological replicates) were germinated and grown for 33–56 days on ISS and ground controls were run in controlled environment chambers under ISS environmental conditions with a 24 h delay for VEG-01A and B and a 72 h delay for VEG-03A. Each experiment began with six rooting pillows. Germinated seeds were thinned to one plant per pillow at day 7. Each independent planting was grown at different times aboard ISS with parallel ground experiments for comparison. VEG-01A was grown from May 8 to June 10, 2014; VEG-01B was grown from July 8 to August 10, 2015, and VEG-03A was grown from October 25 to December 28, 2016. VEG-01A and B were harvested after 33 days of growth using sanitized scissors to remove the leaves (Table 1). VEG-03A leaves were harvested sequentially starting at 33 days followed by 3 weekly harvests. Harvested leaves from each plant were wrapped in foil and placed into a −80°C freezer. The first, third, and half of the fourth harvests were consumed by the crew. Only the 2nd harvest and the remaining leaves (approximately half of the total leaves) of the final harvest from VEG-03A were stored for sample return. After completion of the final harvest for all three plantings, two rooting pillows from each independent experiment were removed from Veggie hardware and placed into bags and frozen at −80°C. Ground control samples were processed and stored the same as flight samples. The Veggie baseplate was positioned 30.5–31.75 cm below the LED light array to provide approximately 200 micromole per square meter per second of photosynthetically active radiation at the surface of the pillows in the center of the Veggie unit at a ratio of 12 red (630 nm): 3 Blue (455 nm): 1 green (530 nm). A photoperiod was set to 16 h light/8 h dark. Both the VEG-01A and part of the VEG-03A experiment on ISS had data collected inside the Veggie chamber using a temperature and relative humidity data logger.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.",

          "Study Description": "The ability to grow safe, fresh food to supplement packaged foods of astronauts in space has been an important goal for NASA. Food crops grown in space experience different environmental conditions than plants grown on Earth (e.g., reduced gravity, elevated radiation levels). To study the effects of space conditions, red romaine lettuce, Lactuca sativa cv ‘Outredgeous,’ plants were grown in Veggie plant growth chambers on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared with ground-grown plants. Multiple plantings were grown on ISS and harvested using either a single, final harvest, or sequential harvests in which several mature leaves were removed from the plants at weekly intervals. Ground controls were grown simultaneously with a 24–72 h delay using ISS environmental data. Food safety of the plants was determined by heterotrophic plate counts for bacteria and fungi, as well as isolate identification using samples taken from the leaves and roots. Molecular characterization was conducted using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to provide taxonomic composition and phylogenetic structure of the community. Leaves were also analyzed for elemental composition, as well as levels of phenolics, anthocyanins, and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC). Comparison of flight and ground tissues showed some differences in total counts for bacteria and yeast/molds (2.14 – 4.86 log10 CFU/g), while screening for select human pathogens yielded negative results. Bacterial and fungal isolate identification and community characterization indicated variation in the diversity of genera between leaf and root tissue with diversity being higher in root tissue, and included differences in the dominant genera. The only difference between ground and flight experiments was seen in the third experiment, VEG-03A, with significant differences in the genera from leaf tissue. Flight and ground tissue showed differences in Fe, K, Na, P, S, and Zn content and total phenolic levels, but no differences in anthocyanin and ORAC levels. This study indicated that leafy vegetable crops can produce safe, edible, fresh food to supplement to the astronauts’ diet, and provide baseline data for continual operation of the Veggie plant growth units on ISS.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "At the completion of the VEG-01A experiments plants were harvested. Plant leaves were wrapped in aluminum foil and placed in -80C (MELFI) until return. Two plant pillows with root material from each experiment were also frozen at -80C until return. Parallel ground experiments were handled and sampled identical to flight with a 24 hour delay.     The Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region was selected as a phylogenetic marker to identify fungi taxonomically to the species level. A dual indexing system for multiplexing was adapted for these communities and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was optimized for reagent concentrations and volume. Each community was labeled with two barcoded primers for identification at completion of sequencing. Amplicons were created in triplicate using 1 ng of template DNA in each reaction. After PCR all amplicons were purified using the Min-Elute System (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA) and quantified with the Qubit 2.0 high sensitivity ds DNA assay (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). The purified amplicons were then pooled in an equimolar concentration to create the library following Illumina protocols.     The sample library was combined with a 10 % Phi-X control library to create diversity and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq using a V2 500-cycle kit (Illumina, Inc, San Diego, CA).     Temperature was maintained during the return of tissues to Kennedy Space Center, where they were also maintained at -80C until processing. Plant leaf material was processed immediately upon thawing and pillows containing roots were thawed at 4 - 8C overnight before sampling was completed. All leaf material was divided for chemical, microbiological and molecular analysis. DNA was extracted from plant leaf and root material of the Veggie pillows using the Microbial Cell DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen, Inc, Carlsbad, CA) then quantified using the Qubit 2.0 double stranded DNA assays (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY).     The variable 4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA) was selected as a phylogenetic markers to identify microorganisms taxonomically to the species level. A dual indexing system for multiplexing was adapted for these communities and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was optimized for reagent concentrations and volume. Each community was labeled with two barcoded primers for identification at completion of sequencing. Amplicons were created in triplicate using 1 ng of template DNA in each reaction. After PCR all amplicons were purified using the Min-Elute System (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA) and quantified with the Qubit 2.0 high sensitivity ds DNA assay (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). The purified amplicons were then pooled in an equimolar concentration to create the library following Illumina protocols.     The sample library was combined with a 10 % Phi-X control library to create diversity and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq using a V2 500-cycle kit (Illumina, Inc, San Diego, CA).     Plants were grown in Veggie pillows containing solid, porous, arcillite (calcined clay) substrate in two different blends, Blend 1: 100% sized to 600 u1 mm or Blend 2: a 1:1 ratio of that size to 1–2 mm (Turface Proleague, Profile Products, LLC) and controlled release fertilizer (Nutricote 18-6-8, type 180, Florikan, Sarasota, FL, United States). Procedures for detailed substrate and pillow preparation are outlined in Massa et al. (2017b). Two surface sanitized seeds were attached with guar in each plant pillow between paired germination wicks. All plant rooting pillows with attached seeds were kept dry in heat sealed, gas-impermeable Tedlar bags until test initiation on the ISS. Seeds for three separate, independent plantings (biological replicates) were germinated and grown for 33–56 days on ISS and ground controls were run in controlled environment chambers under ISS environmental conditions with a 24 h delay for VEG-01A and B and a 72 h delay for VEG-03A. Each experiment began with six rooting pillows. Germinated seeds were thinned to one plant per pillow at day 7. Each independent planting was grown at different times aboard ISS with parallel ground experiments for comparison. VEG-01A was grown from May 8 to June 10, 2014; VEG-01B was grown from July 8 to August 10, 2015, and VEG-03A was grown from October 25 to December 28, 2016. VEG-01A and B were harvested after 33 days of growth using sanitized scissors to remove the leaves (Table 1). VEG-03A leaves were harvested sequentially starting at 33 days followed by 3 weekly harvests. Harvested leaves from each plant were wrapped in foil and placed into a −80°C freezer. The first, third, and half of the fourth harvests were consumed by the crew. Only the 2nd harvest and the remaining leaves (approximately half of the total leaves) of the final harvest from VEG-03A were stored for sample return. After completion of the final harvest for all three plantings, two rooting pillows from each independent experiment were removed from Veggie hardware and placed into bags and frozen at −80°C. Ground control samples were processed and stored the same as flight samples. The Veggie baseplate was positioned 30.5–31.75 cm below the LED light array to provide approximately 200 micromole per square meter per second of photosynthetically active radiation at the surface of the pillows in the center of the Veggie unit at a ratio of 12 red (630 nm): 3 Blue (455 nm): 1 green (530 nm). A photoperiod was set to 16 h light/8 h dark. Both the VEG-01A and part of the VEG-03A experiment on ISS had data collected inside the Veggie chamber using a temperature and relative humidity data logger.     Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.9. Primers were removed with cutadapt v2.3. DADA2 v1.20.0 was utilized for quality-trimming and filtering and inference of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), and taxonomy was assigned with DECIPHER v2.20.0 using the SILVA r138 reference database for 16S samples and the UNITE v2020 reference database for ITS samples.",

          "Study Description": "The ability to grow safe, fresh food to supplement packaged foods of astronauts in space has been an important goal for NASA. Food crops grown in space experience different environmental conditions than plants grown on Earth (e.g., reduced gravity, elevated radiation levels). To study the effects of space conditions, red romaine lettuce, Lactuca sativa cv ‘Outredgeous,’ plants were grown in Veggie plant growth chambers on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared with ground-grown plants. Multiple plantings were grown on ISS and harvested using either a single, final harvest, or sequential harvests in which several mature leaves were removed from the plants at weekly intervals. Ground controls were grown simultaneously with a 24–72 h delay using ISS environmental data. Food safety of the plants was determined by heterotrophic plate counts for bacteria and fungi, as well as isolate identification using samples taken from the leaves and roots. Molecular characterization was conducted using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to provide taxonomic composition and phylogenetic structure of the community. Leaves were also analyzed for elemental composition, as well as levels of phenolics, anthocyanins, and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC). Comparison of flight and ground tissues showed some differences in total counts for bacteria and yeast/molds (2.14 – 4.86 log10 CFU/g), while screening for select human pathogens yielded negative results. Bacterial and fungal isolate identification and community characterization indicated variation in the diversity of genera between leaf and root tissue with diversity being higher in root tissue, and included differences in the dominant genera. The only difference between ground and flight experiments was seen in the third experiment, VEG-03A, with significant differences in the genera from leaf tissue. Flight and ground tissue showed differences in Fe, K, Na, P, S, and Zn content and total phenolic levels, but no differences in anthocyanin and ORAC levels. This study indicated that leafy vegetable crops can produce safe, edible, fresh food to supplement to the astronauts’ diet, and provide baseline data for continual operation of the Veggie plant growth units on ISS.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "A cohort of 36 weeks-old female C57BL/6 mice (Taconic Biosciences) were flown to the ISS and were housed in the Rodent Habitat. Half of the mice were subjected to microgravity for ~30 days and returned to earth alive before euthanization (Live Animal Return, LAR). The other half were subjected to microgravity for 52-55 days before euthanzing on ISS (Iss-Terminal, ISS-T).  All the animals from which the samples were processed in this dataset were operated to insert an implantable subcutaneous nanochannel delivery system prior to launch to deliver sham treatment. The cocktail included Propylene glycol (20%v/v), 1N HCL (10%v/v), Solutol HS 15 (10%v/v), 1N NaOH (5%v/v), PBS (12.5%v/v), and water (42.5%v/v).  The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol (Protocol number RR6) was approved on Oct. 24, 2017 by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     After ~30 days in microgravity, half of the mice returned to earth alive (LAR FLT) and were euthanized by Isoflurane inhalation and were dissected immediately at Novartis Facilities.  The other half of mice were euthanized on ISS (ISS-T FLT) by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine after ~60 days in microgravity. Following blood draw and hind limb dissection, the carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, placed in a ziploc bag and placed in storage at -80C or colder until return to earth and dissected at Houston at a later date.  There were two Basal (BSL) groups of animals sacrificed (LAR BSL & ISS-T BSL) at Kennedy Space Center. A Ground Control group, LAR GC, mimicked the LAR FLT group, which was housed at KSC, then shipped alive to Novartis Facilities, where both the LAR FLT and LAR GC groups were processed.  The ISS-T Ground Controls (ISS-T GC), housed at KSC, followed the same euthanasia timeline, methods, and preservation of the ISS-Terminal Flight. The final dissection of frozen 60-day ISS-T FLT, frozen 60-day ISS-T GC and 0-day ISS-T BSl animals were completed at Houston Methodist Research Institute, in Houston, Texas. For all ISS-T groups, on the day of dissection, the frozen carcasses were removed from -80C freezer and placed in 4C fridge for thawing prior to dissection.  Multiple tissues were collected from each carcass by Primary PI and NASA BSP. The fecal pellets were extruded from the colon during dissection and were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C.  The fecal pellets were shipped frozen to NASA Ames Research Center and handled by LSDA. Samples were processed and proceeded with a list of assays with details described in the corresponding assay tables including the sample names.     DNA was extracted using the Maxwell RSC Purefood GMO and Authentication Kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Half of a frozen fecal pellet was placed into a tube with 940 uL CTAB solution and homogenized using tissue homogenizing bead mix (Navy RINO Lysis, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 4 minutes at 4C. Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at 10C and 21,000 g to deflate foam. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA following the manufacturer's protocol. DNA was eluted in 105 uL RNAse free H2O and was further cleaned using OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit (Zymo Research).  Concentrations for all DNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit DNA HS kit. DNA quality and size were assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with Agilent gDNA ScreenTape Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     DNA library was prepared with the Illumina Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab. Input DNA were approximately ~100 ng. Index adapters were IDT for Illumina, 96-well Nextera Flex Dual Index Adapters, set A. 5 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size ~550 bp was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Multiplexed library concentration was measured with KAPA Library quantification kit (Roche, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).      DNA library prep was performed by the University of Illinois at Chicago. Approximately 300 ng of genomic DNA was sheared by Covaris technology to 350bp fragments. Resulting sheared DNA was bead cleaned with AmpPureXP at a 0.8X bead to DNA ratio. Final DNA concentrations were adjusted to 2ng/ul as measured by the Qubit dsDNA HS assay. 30 ng of sheared DNA was carried through the Swift Accel-NGS 1S Plus DNA kit protocol as described by the company. Resulting libraries were analyzed on the Agilent D1000 TapeStation D1000 and pooled based on nM concentrations. The indexed pool was sequenced on a Mid output MiniSeq run and the observed indexing percentages used to re-pool libraries based on sequencing performance. The normalized sequencing pool was shipped to GeneLab for further sequencing. Normalized pool quality control was performed on iSeq 100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).     DNA library prep was performed by the University of Illinois at Chicago. 10 ng of genomic DNA was used as input to the Swift 16S + ITS assay. Manufacturers protocol (Cat No. AL-51648) was followed with the only exception being after indexing PCR individual libraries were not processed through the Cleanup step 2. Instead a QC pool was constructed with 2ul of each individual library and then the pool was processed through the cleanup step 2 and library quantitation by qPCR (KAPA). Following quantitation the QC pool was run on Illumina MiniSeq and the resulting % of each index used to construct a new pool with balanced indexing. This re-pool was cleaned up and quantitated as was the QC pool and sent for further sequencing.     DNA library prep was performed by the University of Illinois at Chicago. 10 ng of genomic DNA was used as input to a two-stage PCR amplification protocol (Naqib et al. 2018, Naqib et al. 2019). In the first stage, primers 515F/806R (Earth Microbiome Project) containing Fluidigm 'Common Sequence' linkers (CS1 and CS2) were used to amplify gDNA. In the second stage, Fluidigm AccessArray barcoded primers were used to amplify PCR products from the first stage. This PCR incorporated Illumina sequencing adapters and a sample barcode.

Library prep was performed by Loop Genomics. 150 ng genomic DNA was sheared by Covaris g-Tube technology following the manufacturer's recommended setting for 8kb target size. After, sheared DNA was cleaned with SPRIselect bead cleanup at 0.5X ratio and quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS assay. 10ng of sheared DNA was carried through LoopSeq synthetic long-read library preparation by Loop Genomics (San Jose, CA) using a modified version of the LoopSeq Bacterial Genome kit.  Libraries were analyzed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Chip and quantified by KAPA library quantification kit for Illumina.     Whole genome shotgun sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000.  For the libraries prepared with Illumina Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep kit, sequencing was done with paired end 249bp. PhiX included as control.  For the libraries prepared with Swift Accel-NGS 1S Plus DNA kit, sequencing was done with paired end 250bp. 20% PhiX included as control.     The indexed libraries pooled by qPCR quantification were sequenced at Novogene on Illumina HiSeq4000. Paired end 2x150bp reads were used, with a loading concentration of 2nM as determined by qPCR. 10% PhiX included as control. After Illumina sequencing, the raw FASTQ was demultiplexed by Illumina index and then by Loop sample index. Illumina sequencing adaptors were removed using Trimmomatics, and short reads sharing the same molecular barcode were assembled into contigs using SPAdes. The assembled contigs were mapped to a custom-curated database that includes EnsemblBacteria, EnsemblProtists, EnsemblFungi, and human genome.     For the libraries prepared with Swift 16S + ITS assay, sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina iSeq 100. Paired end 149bp. PhiX included as control.

The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module.  Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used.  Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification.  Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped.  Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.",

          "Study Description": "The objective of the Rodent Research-6 (RR-6) study was to evaluate muscle atrophy in mice during spaceflight and to test the efficacy of a novel therapeutic to mitigate muscle wasting. The experiment involved an implantable subcutaneous nanochannel delivery system (nDS; between scapula), which delivered the drug formoterol (FMT; a selective β2 adrenoceptor agonist), over the course of time. To this end, a cohort of forty 32-weeks-old female C57BL/6NTac mice were either sham operated or implanted with vehicle or treatment-filled nDS, launched in two Transporters (20 mice per Transporter) on SpaceX-13 on December 15, 2017. They were transferred to Rodent Habitats onboard the International Space Station (ISS), and maintained in microgravity for 29 days (N=20, Live Animal Return Spaceflight [LAR FLT]), or >50 days (N=20, ISS Terminal Spaceflight [ISS-T FLT]). After 29 days, the 20 LAR FLT animals were returned live to back to Earth on January 13, 2018. After splashdown, the animals were ambulatory on-ground for ~4 days, until all subjects were processed during one day of dissections. There were two Basal (BSL) groups of animals sacrificed (LAR BSL & ISS-T BSL; N=20; 40 animals; ~36 weeks old) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC; 12/9/17). LAR BSL animals were dissected, and samples were collected upon euthanasia. A Ground Control (GC) group, LAR GC, mimicked the LAR FLT group, which was housed at KSC, then shipped alive, to Novartis’s Facilities, where both the LAR FLT and LAR GC groups were processed (~41 weeks old; 1/16/18). All were anesthetized with isoflurane, blood samples were obtained by closed-chest cardiac puncture, and the animals were euthanized by exsanguination and thoracotomy. The 20 ISS-T FLT mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine over the course of a four days of dissections (2/6/18 until 2/9/18; 53-56 days after launch; 44 weeks old at time of on-orbit dissections). Blood samples and euthanasia were conducted the same as LAR groups. Following blood draw and hind limb dissection, the ISS-T FLT animal carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, placed in a ziploc bag and placed in storage at -80˚C or colder until return. The ISS-T Ground Control (ISS-T GC) (at KSC) followed the same euthanasia timeline, methods, and preservation. The final processing of frozen ISS-T FLT, frozen ISS-T GC and frozen 0-day ISS-T BSL animals were completed at Houston Methodist Research Institute, in Houston, TX (5/21/18 until 5/24/18). GeneLab received feces from only sham treated animals (no drug treated animals) from the following groups. FLT: LAR (n=9), ISS-T (n=7); GC: LAR (N=7), ISS-T (N=9); BSL: LAR (n=7), ISS-T (n=9). DNA was extracted and analyzed by sequencing using a variety of different targeted and un-targeted metagenome profiling assays.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "DNA was extracted using the Maxwell RSC Purefood GMO and Authentication Kit (Promega, Madison, WI). One frozen fecal pellet was placed into a tube with 940 uL CTAB solution and homogenized using tissue homogenizing bead mix (Navy RINO Lysis, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 4 minutes at 4C. Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at 10C and 21,000 g to deflate foam. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA following the manufacturer's protocol. DNA was eluted in 105 uL RNAse free H2O and was further cleaned using OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit (Zymo Research).                                                      Concentrations for all DNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit DNA HS kit. DNA quality and size were assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with Agilent gDNA ScreenTape Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     DNA library was prepared with the Illumina Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA).  Input DNA were approximately ~100 ng. Index adapters were IDT for Illumina, 96-well Nextera Flex Dual Index Adapters, set A. 5 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size ~550 bp was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Multiplexed library concentration was measured with KAPA Library quantification kit (Roche, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).     Metagenomics sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Paired end 249bp. PhiX included as control.     Utilizing kraken2 v2.1.1, a human genome reference database was constructed from NCBI's RefSeq (GCF_000001405.39) GRCh38.p13, with --no-masking, and defaults of kmer-length 35 and minimizer-length of 31. FASTQ files were screened against this database, and all successfully classified reads were removed.     Utilizing kraken2 v2.1.1, a mouse genome reference database was constructed from NCBI's RefSeq (GCF_000001635.27) GRCm39, with --no-masking, and defaults of kmer-length 35 and minimizer-length of 31. FASTQ files were screened against this database, and all successfully classified reads were counted and reported as a percentage of the total.     Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.9. Quality-trimming and filtering was performed with bbmap v38.86. Read-based processing was performed with humann v3.0.0. Individual samples were assembled with megahit v1.2.9. Genes were called with prodigal v2.6.3. Taxonomic classification of genes and contigs were performed with CAT v5.2.2. Functional annotation was done with KOFamScan v1.3.0. Reads were mapped to assemblies with bowtie2 v2.3.5.1, and coverage information was extracted for reads and contigs with samtools v1.9 and bbmap v38.86. Binning of contigs was performed with metabat2 v2.15. Bins were summarized with bit v1.8.26 and estimates of quality were generated with checkm v1.1.3. High-quliaty bins (higher than 90% est. completeness and lower than 10% est. redundancy) were taxonomically classified with gtdb-tk v1.5.0.     A cohort of 10 week-old male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory) were launched in one Transporter (10 mice per side), transferred to Rodent Habitats onboard the International Space Station (ISS) and maintained in microgravity for ~33 days (the SpaceX Dragon docked period). No crew activities were required except for standard animal transfers between the Transporter and Habitats, and other activities required to ensure animal welfare, such as health checks and NuRFB replenishments.    Prior to Dragon unberth, all mice were transferred into a clean Transporter followed by transfer to a Dragon capsule and then returned to Earth alive. The duration from splashdown to handover of the mice payload at the pier was approximately 24 hours. After handover of mice to the NASA Rodent Research team, the mice were immediately transported to the animal facility at Loma Linda University for conducting post-flight rodent gait assessment and dissections. The primary investigator teams, BSP teams, and Rodent Research dissection Lead and team conducted the dissection process at LLU immediately following a health check and specimen sampling and acquisition of walking kinematic data and intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements.  A Basal Control (BSL) was housed in standard cages at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and euthanized one day after launch of the FLT animals. Ground Control (GC) and Vivarium Control (VIV) studies were planned to commence at KSC approximately one-week after the conclusion of the flight experiments.  Early termination of RR-9 Ground Control (GC): Due to Hurricane Irma in September 2017 in Florida, the RR9 GC experiments were prematurely terminated. The experiment was repeated in May 2018 using the same strain of mice that was used for the flight experiment to match with flight animals. Besides Ground Control and Vivarium groups, an additional group of animals was used as Cohort Controls (Cohort Control #2) to normalize the variation due to differences in the cohorts.  Cohort control #1 and #2 animals (CC) were not provided with the rodent food bars, lixits, or raised wire floors.     Mice were euthanized, upon live animal return and dissected immediately. Each carcass dissection time was no longer than 1 hour from collection of the first tissue. The fecal pellets were extruded from the colon during dissection, and were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C.",

          "Study Description": "The objective of the Rodent Research-9 (RR-9) mission was to use mice to understand the molecular basis of phenomena that affect astronauts during long-duration spaceflight, particularly visual impairment and joint tissue degradation. To this end, a flight group (FLT) of 10-week-old male C57BL/6J mice was launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on 8/14/2017 and housed in Rodent Habitats on the ISS for 33 days before being returned alive to Earth. After splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, the animals were transported to Loma Linda University (LLU) for testing, euthanasia and dissection on 9/18/2018. A Basal Control (BSL) was housed in standard cages at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and euthanized one day after launch of the FLT animals (8/15/2017). Ground Control (GC) and Vivarium Control (VIV) studies were planned to commence at KSC approximately one-week after the conclusion of the flight experiments. However, all the GC and VIV mouse studies at KSC had to be cancelled due to Hurricane Irma and potential adverse effects on the animal housing facility. The GC and VIV studies were therefore rescheduled and begun in May, 2018. The GC was euthanized and dissected 6/18/2018 - 6/20/2018, while the VIV was euthanized and dissected 6/22/2018 - 6/23/2018. Because this resulted in a different cohort of mice being used for the GC and VIV controls as compared to the flight (FLT) and basal (BSL) groups, two cohort controls were included in the study. The first, Cohort Control 1 (CC_C1), was from the same cohort as the FLT and BSL animals, and was sacrificed and dissected 4 days after the FLT group (9/22/2017). The second, Cohort Control 2 (CC_C2), was from the same cohort as the GC and VIV animals, and was sacrificed and dissected 2-8 days after the GC and VIV groups, (6/24/2018 - 6/26/2018). The CC_C1 and CC_C2 groups were housed in standard cages and fed standard chow in contrast to all other groups which received Rodent Foodbars. To clarify the connections between treatment groups and animal cohorts, the following group abbreviations are used in the sample metadata: Flight (FLT_C1); Basal (BSL_C1); Ground Control (GC_C2); Vivarium Control (VIV_C2), Cohort Control 1 (CC_C1); Cohort Control 2 (CC_C2). Fecal pellets were isolated directly from mice during dissection and preserved by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen before stored at -80 C. DNA was then extracted, shotgun metagenomic libraries generated, and libraries sequenced (target 10 M clusters at PE 250 bp). Metagenomic data was generated from the following groups: Basal Control (n=5), Ground Control (n=5), Vivarium Control (n=5), Cohort Control 1 (n=5), Cohort Control 2 (n=5), Flight (n=5).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "DNA extractions were performed on the five sieved dust samples as well as the passive aerosol sample. 50mg aliquots of the dust samples, the passive aerosol sample and the passive aerosol blank were placed in a separate 2.0mL screw top vials. To optimize the DNA recovered in the extraction 0.3g of 100um glass beads, 0.1 g of 500um glass bead sand 1g of PowerBeads were added to each sample vial. The DNA in each sample was extracted using a modified version of the QIAGEN DNeasy PowerLyzer Microbial Kit (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD, USA)(Yamamoto et al., 2012). Modifications include the alterations to the bead beating described above and a reduction in the final elution volume to 50 uL.     Library preparation was completed by RTL Genomics in Lubbock, TX. More information on the library construction can be found here: http://rtlgenomics.com/short-frag-lib     Illumina MiSeq was used to sequence 15uL aliquots of each DNA extraction at RTL Genomics in Lubbock, TX.\n\nBacterial 16S primers from the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP; http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/protocols-and-standards/16s/; 515F, 5'-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3'; 806R, 5'-GGACTACVSGGGTATCTAAT-3'), and Fungal ITS1F and ITS2 from the EMP (http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/protocols-and-standards/its/; ITS1F, 5'-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA-3'; ITS2, 5'-GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC-3'). 2x250 bp chemistry was utilized.\n\nThe sequencing data was received from RTL Genomics as raw .fastq files which have been uploaded to GeneLab.     Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.8 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.7. Primers were removed with cutadapt v2.3. DADA2 v1.12 was utilized for quality-trimming and filtering and inference of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), and taxonomy was assigned with DECIPHER v2.14 using the SILVA r138 reference database.     Five sieved dust samples and one passive aerosol sample were obtained for this study. Particles on the ISS flow with the ventilation system air currents which are designed for uniform air mixing. Particles are ultimately deposited on the air handling system filter screen coverings. These filters were vacuumed as per normal ISS housekeeping activities. The sieved dust samples were obtained from a vacuum bag returned from the Soyuz vehicle 29S in July 2012. Once returned, the particles within the vacuum bag were sieved though standard test sieves No. 60 (>250 um and <500 um), No. 100 (>150 um and <250 um), No. 140 (>106 um and <150 um), No. 200 (>75 um and <106 um) and No. 270 (>53 um and <75 um). The samples were first analyzed with optical microscopy and photography and placed in plastic ziplock bags for storage.\n\nThe passive aerosol sample from ISS Node 3 was obtained as part of the Aerosol Sampling Experiment (Meyer, 2017)(Meyer, 2018) which took place in December 2016. A passive sampler was placed above a filter, in the path of the incoming airflow, to collect airborne particles in an area where the crewmembers frequently exercised and performed hygiene maintenance. The passive sampler had five drawers containing double sided carbon tape for the collection. Each sample drawer was closed after a certain number of days of exposure to isolate the sample from other ISS air and other samples. The sample substrate that we obtained was exposed to air in the ISS for 16 days before the drawer was closed and is believed to be uncontaminated.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Fecal samples from 32 RR-1 animals were obtained through NASA’s Biospecimen Sharing Program. Briefly, a single cohort of adult(16 weeks of age at the time of launch) female C57BL/6J mice were ordered from the Jackson Laboratory and housed under standard vivarium conditions before launch. All animals were fed on NASA’s spaceflight-approved rodent food bar starting at 24 days prior to the launch and throughout the entire study. Two weeks prior to the launch, animals were regrouped into cages of 10 animals, and a week later, one cage of 10 mice was selected as Flight animals and was launched on Sept. 21,2014, with the SpaceX-4 resupply mission to the ISS.Mice arrived at the ISS 4 days later and were then transferred into the ISS rodent habitat and housed for a total of 37 days in space until euthanasia in orbit.     Samples were collected and processed as described in OSD-48 (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-48). Mouse carcasses were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes. Multiple samples, including fecal pellets, were collected from each carcass. Total dissection time for each carcass was no longer than 30 minutes since collection of the first tissue. Fecal pellets were snap frozen with liquid nitrogen.     Mouse fecal pellets were extracted with Maxwell 16 Tissue DNA Purification Kit implemented on the Maxwell 16 automated extraction robot (Promega, Madison, WI).     The extracted DNA was prepared for sequencing using a two-stage PCR protocol, as described previously (Naqib et al. 2018). First stage PCR amplification was performed using primers (forward 515F GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA and reverse 926R CCGYCAATTYMTTTRAGTTT) targeting the V4-V5 variable regions of microbial 16S ribosomal RNA genes. Primers contained so-called CS1 and 'CS2' linkers at the 5' ends (Fluidigm AccessArray linkers). Subsequently, amplicons were prepared for sequencing through a short 2nd stage PCR (8 cycles) using sample-specific Fluidigm AccessArray primers with unique 10-base barcodes. '     The re-pooled libraries, with a 20%phiX spike-in, were loaded onto a MiSeq v3 flow cell and sequenced (2 × 300 paired-end reads; greater than 40,000 reads/sample requested) using an Illumina MiSeq sequencer. Fluidigm sequencing primers, targeting theCS1 and CS2 linker regions, were used to initiate sequencing. De-multiplexing of reads was performed onthe instrument. Library preparation, pooling, size selection, and sequencing were performed at the University of Illinois at Chicago Sequencing Core (UICSQC).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Both PMA and no-PMA treated samples were then each split into half again. One half (750 ul) of each sample was then transferred to Lysing Matrix E tube (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) and subjected to bead beating for 60 sec to allow cell disruption of hardy cells and spores with a limited loss of microbial diversity. The mechanically disrupted sample was then mixed with the unprocessed counterpart and used for DNA extraction via the Maxwell 16 automated system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), per the manufacturer's protocol. DNA was extracted in 50 ul volume and stored at -20C till further processing. DNA extracted from all CRV samples was quantified using the Qubit Quant-iT dsDNA High Sensitivity Kit (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and samples were selected based on the minimum DNA concentration requirement (~10 pg/uL) for metagenome sequencing. Only two samples from CRV1 and two samples from CRV2, with and without PMA treatment, satisfied this cutoff, resulting in 8 samples proceeding to metagenomics sequencing (2 CRV x 2 samples x 2 treatments equal to 8).     Sample preparation for metagenome sequencing was carried out using the Illumina Nextera Kit. Each library was assessed for quality and fragment size using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. Adapters were added and ligated to DNA sequences in each library. All libraries were then normalized to 2 mM, pooled together and subjected to denaturation followed by dilution to 1.8 pM concentration, as per the manufacturer's protocol.     Sequencing was carried out using the HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina) resulting in 100 bp paired end reads.     A Kraken2 database was constructed from the Kraken2 GRCh38 Homo sapiens data library with k-mer length 35, minimizer length 31, and low complexity sequence mapping options. The Kraken2 classifier was run on FASTQ against this database and unclassified reads retained as contaminant free. Human reads were removed in the raw data files and human reads removed (percent) is provided in the assay table.A Kraken2 database was constructed from the Kraken2 GRCh38 Homo sapiens data library with k-mer length 35, minimizer length 31, and low complexity sequence mapping options. The Kraken2 classifier was run on FASTQ against this database and unclassified reads retained as contaminant free. Human reads were removed in the raw data files and human reads removed (percent) is provided in the assay table.     Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.11) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.11. Quality-trimming and filtering was performed with bbmap v38.86. Read-based processing was performed with humann v3.6. Individual samples were assembled with megahit v1.2.9. Genes were called with prodigal v2.6.3. Taxonomic classification of genes and contigs was performed with CAT v5.2.2. Functional annotation was done with KOFamScan v1.3.0. Reads were mapped to assemblies with bowtie2 v2.3.5.1, and coverage information was extracted for reads and contigs with samtools v1.9 and bbmap v38.86. Binning of contigs was performed with metabat2 v2.15. Bins were summarized with bit v1.8.53 and estimates of quality were generated with checkm v1.1.3. High-quality bins (greater than 90% est. completeness and less than 10% est. redundancy) were taxonomically classified with gtdb-tk v1.5.0.     In this study, three CRV destined to the ISS were sampled at various locations outside and inside of the vehicle (N equals to 22). CRV sampled were scheduled to be birthed to the ISS shortly before (CRV1) or during (CRV2 and CRV8) similar sampling events happening on the ISS (Checinska Sielaff et al. 2019). Seven samples were collected on November 20, 2014 for CRV1, eight on March 18, 2015 for CRV2, and seven on January 26, 2016 for CRV8. Since CRV8 vehicle surfaces were extremely clean and all analyses, including traditional microbiology assays, were below detection limit, data pertaining to CRV8 vehicle locations are not presented in this study. Sampling kits were assembled as that of the assembly detailed in our previous ISS study (Checinska Sielaff et al. 2019; Singh et al. 2018b) to facilitate comparisons between these datasets. Briefly, each polyester wipe (9 x 9; ITW Texwipe, Mahwah, NJ) was soaked in 15 mL of sterile molecular grade water (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 30 min followed by transfer to a sterile zip lock bag (Venkateswaran et al. 2012). Several locations were sampled on CRV surfaces using polyester wipes. A single wipe was used for each location by donning sterile gloves (KIMTEC Pure G3 White; Nitrile Clean-room Certified; Cat. HC61190) to collect a sample of one-meter square area. The samples were stored at 4C and shipped to Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, Pasadena, CA) for processing. Microbiological analyses were carried out within 48 hrs of sampling at JPL. A control wipe (environmental control) was taken out from the zip lock bag, unfolded, waved for 30 s, and packed back inside a new sterile zip lock. One control wipe was included for each CRV sampling session. Similarly, an unused wipe that was flown to Kennedy Space Center and brought back to JPL along with the samples served as a negative control for sterility testing. If field controls (wipes that were exposed to the CRV environment but not used in active sampling) showed any signs of microbial growth, then negative controls would be assayed for cultivable counts to check sterility of the wipes used for sampling. However, none of the field controls showed any colony forming units (CFU) for all CRV sampling events. Sample collection and processing: Samples from CRV were processed in the same way as ISS samples from our previous studies (Checinska Sielaff et al. 2019). Briefly, each wipe was transferred to an individual 500 mL bottle containing 200 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and vigorously hand shaken for two minutes. The resulting suspension was then concentrated to 4 mL using a CP-150 concentration pipette (Innova Prep, Drexel, MO) and a 0.45 um hollow fiber polysulfone tip. Viability assay: Before DNA extraction, half of the sample was treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) so that the microbiome of intact/viable cells (PMA treatment) could be characterized. The PMA-untreated samples yielded information about the total microbial population (including free DNA, dead cells, cells with a compromised cell membrane, intact cells, and viable cells). PMA binds to DNA, making the DNA unavailable for amplification during PCR steps (Nocker et al. 2007). Due to its higher molecular weight and/or charge, PMA cannot penetrate into cells that have an intact cell membrane (i.e. viable) but can bind to free floating DNA or DNA inside cells with a compromised cell membrane (i.e. dead cells) (Nocker et al. 2006; Nocker et al. 2007). It is in this way that many studies have utilized PMA to distinguish between intact/viable cells and compromised/dead cells (Checinska et al. 2015; Jager et al. 2018; Lin et al. 2011; Vaishampayan et al. 2013). A 3 mL aliquot of the concentrated sample was split into two halves. One 1.5 mL aliquot was treated with PMA (Biotium, Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) to a final concentration of 25 uM, followed by 5 min incubation in the dark at room temperature. The sample was then exposed to photoactivation for 15 min in a PMA-Lite LED Photolysis Device (Biotium, Inc., Hayward, CA, USA). The other aliquot with no PMA treatment was also incubated in dark for 5 min followed by photoactivation for 15 min similar to the PMA treated aliquot.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Materials collected from three sample types examined as part of this study included the following: ISS filter particles obtained from HEPA systems onboard the space station (ISS filter), ISS dust samples obtained through vacuum collection within the cabin (ISS dust), and dust samples obtained through vacuum collection from a cleanroom where spacecraft are assembled (SAF dust). Portions of the cargo destined for the ISS are prepared in cleanrooms (class 100K) such as the SAF, where spacecraft are assembled; thus, any pre-existing commonality between the environments, derived from this subset of components, was of interest. Due to low biomass limitations in the availability of these materials, one sample was analyzed for each group. However, about 1 g of particulate materials was aseptically scraped from the HEPA filter and from the vacuum cleaner bags. These samples were either untreated to examine total microbial burden or subjected to PMA treatment to examine viable microbial content.\n\nThe materials collected using the HEPA filter system (40 months old) are representative of circulating air, and the vacuum cleaner bag was representative of fixed ISS (1-day collection) or JPL-SAF (180 days) surfaces.\n\nVacuumed dust samples were collected and weighed, whereas the HEPA filter elements were divided into small pieces and particulates associated with the pieces were aseptically collected using sterile scalpels before being quantitatively measured. Approximately 1 g of each vacuum dust and HEPA filter-associated particles was weighed, placed into a sterile tube containing 25 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and vortexed for 1 min. After vigorous mixing, large particles were allowed to settle, and aliquots of samples were carefully siphoned and DNA extracted.     The biological materials associated with each sample (15 mL) were further concentrated using Amicon Ultra-50 Ultracel centrifugal filter tubes (Millipore). Each filter unit has a molecular mass cutoff of 50 kDa, which facilitates the concentration of microbial cells, spores, and exogenous nucleic acid fragments greater than 100 bp in a final volume of 2.5 mL. All filtered samples were then divided into three separate aliquots: the first aliquot (1000 uL) was subjected to PMA pre-treatment (viability assessment), the second (1000 uL) was an untreated environmental sample (viable + nonviable; i.e., total DNA), and the third (500 uL) was archived for other molecular characterizations. For measuring the viable microbial population, one aliquot of filter-concentrated sample suspension (1000 uL) was treated with 12.5 uL of PMA (2 mM; Biotium, Inc.) to a final concentration of 25 uM, followed by thorough mixing and incubation in the dark for 5 min at room temperature. The sample was exposed to the PhAST Blue-PhotoActivation System (GenIUL, S.L.) for 15 min (in parallel with the non-PMA-treated sample). This step facilitates the blocking of DNA from dead cells. The samples were then split in half; one half was subjected to bead beating with the Fastprep-24 bead-beating instrument (MP Biomedicals) with parameters set at 5 m/s for 60 s. The second half of the unprocessed sample was combined with the mechanically disrupted counterpart before DNA was extracted via the Maxwell 16 automated system (Promega), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Resulting DNA suspensions (100 uL each) were stored at ‚-20C.     Extremely limited quantities of biomass were available for study, with all extracted DNA samples yielding less than1 ng/uL; thus, a whole genome amplification step was necessary. All nucleic acid samples were subjected to multiple displacement amplification (MDA) using the phi29-based Repli-g system (Qiagen). This platform has been shown to impart less amplification-based bias when compared to comparable systems. Amplified samples were purified using the DNA Clean and Concentrator Kit (Zymo Research). DNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using the Nextera DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina). Quality and fragment size were assessed on the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent). Libraries were normalized to 2 nM, pooled, denatured, and diluted to 1.8 pM according to the manufacturer‚Äôs standard recommendations (Illumina).     Sequencing was performed on the NextSeq 500 with the NextSeq Series High Output Kit v2 (Illumina), using 150-bp, paired-end reads.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7107 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Metagenomics/Illumina/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7107_Versions/GL-DPPD-7107.md) using workflow SW_MGIllumina v2.0.2 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/SW_MGIllumina_2.0.2/Metagenomics/Illumina/Workflow_Documentation/SW_MGIllumina). Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.11. Quality-trimming and filtering was performed with bbmap v38.86. Read-based processing was performed with humann v3.6, the following describes the assembly-based processing. Individual samples were assembled with megahit v1.2.9. Genes were called with prodigal v2.6.3. Taxonomic classification of genes and contigs was performed with CAT v5.2.2 against their pre-packaged NCBI nr database (CAT_prepare_20210107.tar.gz). Functional annotation of genes was done with KOFamScan v1.3.0.

          "Study Protocol Description": "For extraction, a 0.9% w/v NaCl solution was prepared using heat-treated NaCl (24 h, 250 °C, in order to degrade remnants of contaminating DNA) and autoclaved PCR-grade water (LiChrosolv, Merck Millipore). Three 5–10 cm2 pieces of fabric were aseptically cut out of the vacuum cleaner bags and dust filters and submerged in 15 ml 0.9% DNA-free NaCl solution.\n\nThe fabric pieces in solution were then vortexed for 10 s, manually shaken for 15 s, ultra-sonicated at 40 kHz for 2 min, and finally vortexed for 10 s to detach the dust from the fabric. The fabric was aseptically removed from the solution, and resulting suspension and solid fabric pieces were used for cultivation and molecular analyses.     Extracts of different ISS samples obtained from the Russian Service Module of the ISS were provided by T. Alekhova and her team. Dust samples were retrieved during ISS-expedition 9 in October 2004 and during ISS-expedition 16 in April 2008: sample 1: 'Dust filter-1 (2004),' dust filter of ventilation system (internal abbreviation: RISS1); sample 2: 'Dust filter-2 (2004),' dust filter of ventilation system (internal abbreviation: RISS4); sample 3: 'Dust collector (2004),' from vacuum cleaner (internal abbreviation: RISS5); sample 4: 'Dust filter (2008),' dust filter of ventilation system (internal abbreviation: RISS3); sample 5: 'Dust collector (2008),' from vacuum cleaner (internal abbreviation: RISS2). During the entire time after retrieval, the vacuum cleaner bags and dust filters were stored sealed (never opened since sampling on the ISS), under dry conditions at ambient temperature. Culture controls done from an unused, sterile dust collector and dust filter were negative.     After aliquots were removed for cultivation assays, the remaining dust suspension was centrifuged at 16,000 g to concentrate the remaining dust particles and microorganisms, which were then re-suspended in three aliquots of 0.5 ml of the supernatant. One aliquot was directly frozen at -80C, and one was treated with an end concentration of 50 uM propidium monoazide (PMA), to block free DNA of dead cells from downstream applications before freezing.\n\nOne aliquot was mixed with 0.5 ml of pre-warmed 30 C LB medium and incubated at 30 C for 1.5 h prior to direct DNA extraction with the aim of increasing the biomass and possibly triggering the germination of spores, which have been reported to resist state-of-the-art DNA extraction methods [5]. DNA was extracted using the modified XS-Buffer method as described previously. DNA concentrations were determined using Qubit, and DNA was afterwards subjected to PCR     Library preparation and sequencing were carried out at the Core Facility Molecular Biology at the Center for Medical Research at the Medical University Graz, Austria. In brief, DNA concentrations were normalized using a SequalPrep normalization plate (Invitrogen), and each sample was indexed with a unique barcode sequence (8 cycles index PCR). After pooling of the indexed samples, a gel cut was carried out to purify the products of the index PCR.     Sequencing was done using the Illumina MiSeq device and MS-102-3003 MiSeq Reagent Kit v3-600cycles (2x251 cycles).     Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.8 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.7. Primers were removed with cutadapt v2.3. DADA2 v1.12 was utilized for quality-trimming and filtering and inference of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), and taxonomy was assigned with DECIPHER v2.14 using the SILVA r138 reference database.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Sample processing took place in a ISO 7 (10K class) clean-room at JPL. In a certified biosafety cabinet, each wipe was aseptically removed from the zip lock bag and transferred to a 500 mL bottle containing 200 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4). The bottle with the wipe was shaken for 2 min followed by concentration with a Concentrating Pipette (Innova Prep, Drexel, MO) using a 0.22 μm Hollow Fiber Polysulfone tips (Cat  : CC08022). Each sample was concentrated to 4 mL with PBS elution fluid. Then, 3 mL of this concentrated sample was split into two 1.5 mL aliquots. One aliquot was treated with PMA (18.25 μL of 2 mM PMA, resulting in a final concentration of 25 μM) to assess cells that were viable or had an intact cell membrane, while the second aliquot was handled in a similar manner but without the addition of PMA. The PMA and non-PMA-treated aliquots were incubated in the dark at RT for 5 min, followed by 15 min of photoactivation using the PMA-LiteTM LED Photolysis Device, specifically designed for photoactivation of PMA (Biotium, Hayward, CA). The PMA- and non-PMA -treated aliquots were then split into two 0.75 mL aliquots. One aliquot was transferred to bead beating tubes containing Lysing Matrix E (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA), followed by bead beating for 60 s using the vortex sample holder (MO Bio, Carlsbad, CA). The bead-beaten aliquot and the aliquot without bead beating were combined for their corresponding PMA-treated and non-treated samples. DNA extraction was performed with the Maxwell 16 automated system (Promega, Madison, WI), in accordance with manufacture instructions using the Maxwell 16 Tissue LEV Total RNA purification kit. A Maxwell control (MC) without any sample added in its cartridge was run concurrently with each flight sample. The extracted DNA was eluted in 50 μL of water and stored at − 20 °C until further analysis.     Bacterial diversity was assessed by analyzing the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene coding sequence. Amplification was performed with the following primer pair: forward primer, A519F (new nomenclature: S-D-Arch-0519-a-S-15), 5′-CAG CMG CCG CGG TAA-3′, and the reverse primer 802R (new nomenclature: S-D-Bact-0785-b-A-18,) 5′-TAC NVG GGT ATC TAA TCC-3′. Expected amplicon size is 283 for Bacteria as estimated for 16S rRNA gene sequences deposited in the Silva SEED Reference Database. Fungal diversity was assessed by analyzing the ITS1 region between 18S and 5.8S rRNA coding sequences. Amplification primers were ITS1-F_KYO2 (5′-TAG AGG AAG TAA AAG TCG TAA-3′) and ITS2_KYO2 (5′-TTY RCT RCG TTC TTC ATC-3′). Expected amplicon length distribution is 271 ± 90 bp for Ascomycota, 284 ± 42 bp for Basidiomycota, and 216 ± 94 bp for non-Dikarya species. PCR synthesis of SSU-V4 and ITS1 amplicons was performed using Q5 High-Fidelity PCR Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The 40-μL reaction mixtures were incubated under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94 ° C for3 min followed by 35cycles of 94°C for 30s, 47°C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 90 s, with a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. Afterwards, each reaction mixture was fractionated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel, recovering all PCR products in the size range of 200 to 400 bp. The amplicons were isolated from gel slices using silica spin-columns, and eluted with nano-pure water. The purified amplicons were tagged with barcoded Illumina adapters using TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Library Prep Kit LT (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries were quantified on a TBS-380 Fluorimeter (Turner BioSystems, Sunnyvale, CA) using PicoGreen dye (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as a dsDNA-binding fluorogenic reagent. The dsDNA length distribution in individual library preps was assessed by analysis on a 2100 Bioanalyzer with High Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The libraries were pooled to be present at equimolar concentrations in each mixed sample with total concentration of 10 nM. The first mixed sample contained 20 16S rRNA-V4 libraries and 17 ITS1 libraries representing the first ISS sampling session together with corresponding controls. The second mixed sample contained 21 16S rRNA-V4 libraries and 20 ITS1 libraries representing the second ISS sampling session and corresponding controls.     The two sample sets were sequenced on a NextSeq 500 Sequencing System (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with NextSeq 500/550 Mid-Output v2 Kit for 300 main and 6 index cycles.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7104-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Amplicon/Illumina/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7104_Versions/GL-DPPD-7104-A.md), using workflow SW_AmpIllumina v1.1.0 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/SW_AmpIllumina-A_1.1.0/Amplicon/Illumina/Workflow_Documentation/SW_AmpIllumina-A). This dataset had 16S and ITS primers mixed in each fastq file. These were first separated with cutadapt v3.4 (see 'split-by-primers.sh' in the included 'processing_info.zip'). For both 16S and ITS subsets, quality assessment of filtered reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.9. DADA2 v1.20.0 was utilized for quality-trimming and filtering and inference of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), For the 16S data, taxonomy was assigned with DECIPHER v2.20 using the SILVA r138 reference database. For the ITS data, taxonomy was assigned with DECIPHER v2.20 using the UNITE v2020 reference database.     Sampling wipes were prepared at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL; Pasadena, CA). Briefly, each polyester wipe (9′′ × 9′′; ITW Texwipe, Mahwah, NJ) was folded two times and soaked in 15 mL of sterile molecular grade water (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 30 min followed by the transfer to a sterile zip lock bag. The sampling kit was assembled at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC, Moffett Field, CA). The implementation team at NASA ARC delivered the kit to the Cargo Mission Contract at Johnson Space Center (Texas) which was then transferred to Kennedy Space Center (Florida) in order to be loaded into the Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) Dragon space- craft prior to launch. Briefly, each sampling kit was sent to International Space Station as a part of the Space-X cargo, and returned to the Earth on Soyuz TM-14 or Dragon capsule. The kits were delivered to JPL immediately after the arrival to Earth. During each sampling session on the ISS, only one astronaut collected samples from eight different locations using wipes and contact slides. Each wipe was used to collect a sample of one-meter square. The control wipe (environmental control) was only taken out from the Zip lock bag, unfolded and packed back to the zip lock. The samples were stored at 4 C until the return trip to Earth and subsequent processing.",

          "Study Description": "The environmental microbiome study was designed to decipher microbial diversity of the International Space Station surfaces in terms of spatial and temporal distributions using 16S and ITS iTag Illumina sequencing. We hypothesized that the microbial population of environmental surfaces changes in time due to astronauts' activity and might be location specific. The environmental samples were collected with the polyester wipes from eight different locations in the ISS during two consecutive sampling sessions (three months apart). The specific objective was to unveil the viable microbial diversity of each location during two separate sessions in terms of abundance and richness of the communities. The International Space Station (ISS) as a closed built environment has its own environmental microbiome which is shaped by microgravity, radiation, and limited human presence. The microbial diversity associated with ISS environmental surfaces was investigated during this study. Polyester wipes and contact slides were used for sampling of eight various surface locations on the ISS at different time periods. The samples were retrieved and analyzed immediately upon the return to the Earth (via Soyuz TMA-14M or Dragon capsule from SpaceX). After surface sample collection, contact slides containing nutrient media for the growth of bacteria and fungi were incubated at 25C. The polyester wipes were processed to measure microbial burden (R2A, Blood Agar, and Potato Dextrose Agar) and recover cultivable bacteria as well as fungi. Subsequently, viable microbial burden was assessed using Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) assay, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods after propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment. The 16S-tag and metagenome analyses were used to elucidate viable microbial diversity. The cultivable bacterial population yield from the polyester wipes was very high (5 to 7-logs) when compared with the contact slides (102 to 103 CFU/m2). The PMA-qPCR analysis showed considerable variation of viable bacterial population (105 to 109 16S rDNA gene copies/m2) among locations sampled. Unlike contact slides, polyester wipes cover much larger sample surface (~1 m2) and produce much more reliable results of the microbial diversity of the ISS covering both cultivable and non-cultivable species. The cultivable, total, and viable microbial diversity was determined utilizing state-of-the art molecular techniques. The implementation of the PMA assay before DNA extraction allowed distinguishing viable microorganisms, which is crucial for determining their role to the crew health, the ISS maintenance and the general knowledge of the closed environmentally controlled built systems.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Sampling in Kibo was performed three times by an astronaut as part of the Microbe research program. The sampling locations inside the Kibo module were the internal and outer surface of the incubator named CBEF (Cell Biology Experiment Facilities; low frequency of astronaut contact), an air return grill and an air diffuser (reflection of the bacterial community of the air in Kibo), and handrail (high frequency of astronaut contact). The air return grill and the inside of the incubator were selected as sampling points from Microbe-II onwards. An optimized swabbing protocol was used for sampling the interior surfaces. Samples were stored in the freezer (-95 C) installed in Kibo and transferred to our laboratory via the NASA Kennedy Space Center and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency Tsukuba Space Center at -80 C. We previously confirmed that long-term storage with freezing does not affect the number of bacteria collected with swab method.\n\nBacteria collected with swabs were suspended in 10 ml of particle-free sterilized water and trapped on an autoclaved polycarbonate membrane filter (pore size 0.2 um; Advantec, Tokyo, Japan) in a funnel (filtration area 13 mm^2; KGS-04, Advantec). Bacterial cells on the filter were stained with filter-sterilized 1x SYBR Green II nucleic acid staining dye (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). We enumerated fluorescently stained bacterial cells under an epifluorescent microscope (E-400; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with the Nikon filter sets B2-A (EX450-490, DM505, BA520). One-hundred microscopic fields (1 mm^2) per sample were observed.     Following microscopic observation, DNA was extracted from bacterial cells on the polycarbonate filter as described previously.6 Extracted DNA was suspended in TE buffer (10 mmol/l Tris-HC1, 1 mmol/l EDTA, pH 8.0) and stored at -20 C before use. To estimate the DNA recovery rate during extraction, known amounts of PCR products of the luciferase gene (luc) fragment were inoculated into the samples as an internal standard and quantified after DNA extraction. The DNA recovery rate was calculated by comparing the copy number of the inoculated luc gene before and after DNA extraction.     In this study, we used a two-step PCR protocol. The first PCR amplification was performed using primers 968f and 1401r, which are specific for conserved bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences. The PCR mixture, containing 1.25 U of AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 25 pmol of each primer, 75 nmol of MgCl2, 10 nmol of each deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate, 5 ul of 10x PCR buffer, and 0.25 ul of 2.5 mg/ml 8-methoxypsoralen (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) in dimethyl sulfoxide, was made up to 48 ul with DNA-free water. A DNA suspension was added last in a 2-ul volume after irradiation of the PCR mixture with ultraviolet light (365 nm). A hot-start PCR was performed at 95 C for 9 min, and touchdown PCR was performed as follows: the annealing temperature was initially set at 63 C and was then decreased by 1 C every cycle until it was 53 C. Twenty additional cycles were carried out at 53 C. Denaturing was carried out at 94 C for 1 min. Annealing was performed using the scheme described above for 1 min, and extension was performed at 72 C for 3 min. The final extension step was 7 min at 72 C. The first PCR product was purified with a Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and eluted with nuclease-free water. The second PCR used the purified products of the first PCR as templates. Amplification was performed as described above, except that primers with an adapter and 10-nt-length barcode were used, and the total number of amplification cycles was reduced to 18. The second PCR product was also purified with a Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System and eluted with nuclease-free water. PCR product was quantified with a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen) and mixed in approximately equal concentrations (5x10^10 copies/ul).     16S rRNA gene fragments, including V6-8 regions, were amplified and analyzed by amplicon sequencing with the GS FLX System (Roche Diagnostics).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "DNA was isolated from homogenized fecal samples using a FastDNA SPIN kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH). This method includes a physical disruption step to ensure genomic DNA isolation from Gram positive bacteria. Purified DNA was stored at -80°C. A negative control containing H2O instead of sample was purified in parallel to each set of extractions to screen for contamination of extraction reagents.     Initial amplification of the V1-V2 region of the bacterial 16S rDNA was performed on total DNA isolated from fecal samples. Each sample was individually gel purified using the E-Gel Electrophoresis System. To ensure equal representation of each sample in the sequencing run, each barcoded sample was standardized by calculating equimolar amounts prior to pooling.     Pooled samples of the 16S rDNA multiplexed amplicons were sequenced on a Roche 454 Genome Sequencer FLX Titanium instrument using the GS FLX Titanium XLR70 sequencing reagents and protocols.     Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.8 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.7. Primers were removed with cutadapt v2.3. Quality-trimming and filtering was performed with bbmap v38.86. vsearch v2.15.1 was utilized for generating operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and taxonomy was assigned with DECIPHER v2.12 using the SILVA r138 reference database.     Experiment 1 - fractionated low LET gamma radiation and high dietary iron in rats: Thirty two, 12-week-old, male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA) were acclimated to an adequate iron diet (45 mg iron (ferric citrate)/kg diet) for 3 weeks (AIN-93G; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) and then assigned to one of four groups: adequate Fe diet/no radiation (CON), adequate Fe diet/radiation (RAD), high Fe diet (650 mg iron (ferric citrate)/kg diet)/no radiation (IRON), and high Fe diet/radiation (IRON+RAD). Animals received the assigned diet for 4 weeks.\n\nExperiment 2 - high LET 28silicon particle exposure and partial weight bearing (1/6 G) in mice: Twenty-eight, 4-month-old, female BalbC/ByJ mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and shipped to the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) animal care facility. The animals were acclimated to single housing conditions, and a standard diet (Harlan Teklad 8604) and water were available ad libitum for 14 days prior to radiation exposure. After acclimation, half of the animals were suspended horizontally in cages by a device with a tension spring that could be adjusted to maintain 1/6 G weight bearing (LUN) on all four limbs as described previously. The remaining animals served as full weight bearing (WB) controls.\n\nExperiment 3 - combined high LET and low LET radiation exposures and microgravity conditions during short term space flight in mice: Fourteen, 49-day-old, female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River, Raleigh, NC, USA) were acclimated to NASA Rodent Foodbar diets and water for 2 wk. All animals were then loaded into NASA-designed animal enclosure modules (AEMs) and given ad libitum access to food and water for the remainder of the study. Half of the animals were flown on the Space Shuttle Atlantis mission STS-135 for a period of 13 days. Lights in both the ground and flight AEM were on a 12/12 h light/dark cycle.     Experiment 1 - fractionated low LET gamma radiation and high dietary iron in rats: On day 14 of the experiment, animals began exposures to a 0.375 Gy fractionated radiation dose of 137Cs every other day for 16 days (3 Gy total dose) at the NASA Johnson Space Center. Animals in both the sham and radiation groups were placed in a restraint tube (Battelle, Geneva, Switzerland) for about 10 min per treatment session. On day 29 (24 h after last radiation exposure), animals were euthanized using isoflurane vapor. Cesium-137 produces gamma rays with an energy of 0.662 MeV and has a half-life of 30.1 years. Ionizing radiation energy values were added by GeneLab.\n\nExperiment 2 - high LET 28silicon particle exposure and partial weight bearing (1/6 G) in mice: Half of the LUN and WB mice were exposed to one dose of high LET ionizing 28Si (0.050 Gy at 300 MeV/nucleon, 0.25 Gy/min), simulating GCR. All animals were anesthetized with a ketamine:xylazine cocktail before euthanasia by decapitation on day 21.\n\nExperiment 3 - combined high LET and low LET radiation exposures and microgravity conditions during short term space flight in mice: All animals were then loaded into NASA-designed animal enclosure modules (AEMs) and given ad libitum access to food and water for the remainder of the study. Half of the animals were flown on the Space Shuttle Atlantis mission STS-135 for a period of 13 days.     The absorbed dose from ionizing radiation received by the flight specimens was estimated using TLD passive dosimeters located in the middeck of the space shuttle, where the payload was located. More specifically, we computed the average between three dosimeters (DLOC1, DLOC2, and DLOC3) for the mission and we divided it by the total duration of the mission to estimate the average absorbed dose rate in mGy/day. This dose rate did not include any shielding effects from the hardware where the specimens resided. The total absorbed dose in water was then computed by simply multiplying the average dose rate with the duration of the experiment. The duration of the experiment was defined as the time in space during which the specimen was 'living'. Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. A table with these detailed computations for all space shuttle datasets is available on GeneLab at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation. The ground samples were not assessed for radiation exposure.     Experiment 1: On day 29 (24 h after last radiation exposure), animals were euthanized using isoflurane vapor. The colon was resected, feces removed for microbial sequencing analysis, and colonic mucosa scraped in order to determine gene expression.\n\nExperiment 2: All animals were anesthetized with a ketamine:xylazine cocktail before euthanasia by decapitation on day 21. The colon was resected, feces removed, and the colonic mucosa scraped as part of a tissue sharing program.\n\nExperiment 3: Following landing (3-7 hours), all animals were anesthetized by isoflurane gas and euthanized by decapitation. The colon was resected, feces removed, a 1 cm section of the colon was fixed for histological preparations, and the remainder of the colon mucosa was harvested by scraping as part of a tissue sharing program.\n\nUpon resection of the colon at termination, fresh fecal samples were collected and transferred to sterile cryotubes, snap frozen, then transported to Texas A and M University on dry ice and stored at -80C.",

          "Study Description": "We report how high and low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation, microgravity, and elevated dietary iron affect colon microbiota (determined by 16S rDNA pyrosequencing) and colon function. Three independent experiments were conducted: 1) fractionated low LET gamma radiation (137Cs, 3 Gy, RAD), high Fe diet (IRON) (650 mg/kg diet), and a combination of low LET gamma radiation and high Fe diet (IRON+RAD) in male Sprague-Dawley rats; 2) high LET 38Si particle exposure (0.050 Gy), 1/6 G partial weight bearing (PWB), and a combination of high LET38Si particle exposure and PWB in female BalbC/ByJ mice; and 3) 13 d spaceflight in female C57BL/6 mice. For each experiment, the colon was resected and feces removed for microbial sequencing analysis on a Roche 454 Genome Sequencer FLX Titanium instrument (Microbiome Core Facility, Chapel Hill NC) using the GS FLX Titanium XLR70 sequencing reagents and protocols. Analysis of amplicon sequencing data was carried out using the QIIME pipeline. Low LET radiation, high iron diet, and spaceflight increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes. Low LET radiation, high Fe diet, and spaceflight did not significantly affect diversity or richness, or elevate pathogenic genera. Spaceflight increased Clostridiales and decreased Lactobacillales, and similar trends were observed in the experiment using a ground-based model of microgravity, suggesting altered gravity may affect colonic microbiota. Microbiota characteriztion in these models is a first step in understanding the impact of the space environment on intestinal health.",
