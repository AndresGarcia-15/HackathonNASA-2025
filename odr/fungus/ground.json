          "Study Protocol Description": "The samples were collected by using moist polyester wipes and subsequently the wipes were agitated in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The PBS suspension was concentrated using an InnovaPrep CP150 concentrating pipette, and spread onto different media plates (Dichloran Rose bengal Agar, Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) and Dichloran glycerol agar). The plates were incubated at 25˚C for 7 to 14 days before isolating fungal strains and stored for further identification. Fungal isolates were restreaked on PDA plates to obtain pure culture and suitable biomass for DNA isolation.     The genomic DNA extraction was performed using the ZymoBIOMICS MagBead DNA kit as per manufacturer’s instructions.     WGS libraries were prepared with an Illumina Nextera DNA Flex library preparation kit.     The fungal genomes were sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 paired-end 2 X 150-bp platform by using a S4 flow cell.     FastQC v0.11.7 and Fastp v0.20.0 was used for filtering and trimming of reads and the genomes were assembled using SPAdes v3.11.1.",
