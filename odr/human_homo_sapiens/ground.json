          "Study Protocol Description": "WAG male rats (n equals 69), a substrain of WAG/Rij, separated from the colony at Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO, Rijswijk, Netherlands), in about 1975, and maintained at Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), were shipped to the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Upton, NY. The hindlimb unloading )HU) procedure was initiated 5 days prior to sham-irradiation or irradiation as described below. On Day 1, the rats were randomly grouped to serve as either full weight-bearing on all four limbs, or to be HU via tail suspension with body weight borne on the two front limbs. The HU procedure was a modified version of the one previously published (Wiley et al., 2016). Briefly, rats were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane (2.5–3.0%; 100% oxygen flow rate). While anesthetized, the tail was cleaned using 70% isopropyl alcohol. Benzoin tincture was applied to the lateral surfaces of the tail prior to the placement of strips (1 cm wide by 30 cm long) of adhesive medical traction tape (3M, St. Paul, MN, United States). The tape was placed approximately 1 cm from base of the tail, spanning distally for approximately the next 3/4ths the length of the tail. The free end of the tape was looped through a catch that was part of a custom-build plastic ball bearing swivel. After passing through the swivel, the tape was symmetrically adhered to the other lateral side of the tail in a similar spatial manner. Three pieces of 1/2-in micropore surgical tape (3M, St. Paul, MN, United States) were secured perpendicularly along the traction tape. A 1.56-in stainless oval wire carabiner clip (Nite Ize, Boulder, CO, United States) was attached through a hole on the top portion of the plastic swivel, with the other end of the carabiner clip attached to a zipper hook that slides along a perlon cord (STAS group, BA, Eindhoven, Netherlands). The cord was attached to a clothesline support separator spreader pulley (Blue Hawk, Gilbert, AZ, United States) that slides along a 5/16-in diameter round, solid steel rod (Hillman, Cincinnati, OH, United States). Once the attachment was complete, the zipper lock was adjusted along the perlon cord to lift the hind limbs fully off the substrate with a pitch angle of the thorax and abdomen 30\u000edegree relative to the horizontal substrate plane. Rats quickly recovered from anesthesia and were monitored closely for the next 24 h. Rats maintained under standard gravitational conditions (non-HU) received isoflurane, but were not tail suspended. All HU and non-HU rats were further subgrouped as to receive one of the two radiation doses (0.75 Gy or 1.5 Gy) or sham-irradiation (0 Gy), and all animals were singly housed. Monitoring over the next 5 days was carefully performed to ensure the HU rats had access to food and water and could move smoothly across the cage, despite the hind limbs not touching the substrate. Wet rodent chow and gel packs were provided to ensure hydration. Corrugated cardboard bedding was supplied to permit burrowing for all rats. On Day 5, animals were transferred from HU or non-HU housing to a new plexiglass box (holder) drilled with air holes for radiation or sham-radiation exposure. HU animals remained suspended through the transferring process by removing the plastic ball bearing from the carabiner and relocating the animal to a plastic plexiglass holder (9.5' x 4' x 7.5') where plastic bead chains were attached to the swivel. The new holders were placed into a rigid foam frame allowing six rats (in six holders) to be placed into the beamline simultaneously. The frame accommodated lengths of plastic bead-chains hanging from a top cross bar. One bead chain was looped through the hole in the plastic swivel, and the free end of the bead chain was affixed to itself using a plastic zip tie. The bead chain was then adjusted at the cross bar to ensure a 30 degree of the body of the relative to the plexiglass floor of the holder, with the hind limbs remaining off the floor. Each holder lid contained a cutout section to permit closure with the tail extending upward toward the cross bar. This process was repeated five more times, such that a total six rats were HU and stacked (3 high; with two rats on the bottom, middle, and top levels) within the foam frame. Rats that did not receive HU were placed into similar plexiglass boxes drilled with airholes and stacked into rigid foam frames, but remained full weight-bearing. Their holders were smaller (8' x 4' x 4'), and were aligned in a matrix of three horizontal capsules and four vertical one for irradiation on the beam line (or sham-irradiation). Rats were then transported to the NSRL facility on each irradiation day for sham-irradiation or radiation exposure. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.     After 2 weeks of acclimatization, and at 9 months of age, they were sham-irradiated or irradiated with a standardized, simplified 5-ion exposure prescribed by NASA and referred to as simGCRsim (consisting of rapid, sequential exposure to protons (1000 MeV/n, LET equals 0.2 keV/mm, 35%), 28Si ions (600 MeV/n, LET equals 50.4 keV/mm, 1%), 4He ions (250 MeV/n, LET equals 1.6 keV/mm, 18%), 16O ions (350 MeV/n, LET equals 16.9 keV/mm, 6%), 56Fe ions (600 MeV/n, LET equals 173.8 keV/mm, 1%), and protons (250 MeV/n, LET equals 0.4 keV/mm, 39%). Rats were exposed to 0 or 1.5 Gy) at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at BNL on May 7 or May 8, 2019. The 1.5 Gy cohort included experimental groups of simulated weightlessness using HU alone and HU in combination with radiation. NSRL GCR and SPE simulations are designed to approximate the chronic mixed field exposures in space by means of sequential acute exposures to a variety of ion/energy combinations.  The exposure protocols are on the NSRL website: https://www.bnl.gov/nsrl/userguide/simgcrsim.php (SimGCRSim).  The dose can be administered either in a single series of exposures lasting approximately an hour or in daily fractions over several weeks.  The GCR simulations are described in detail here: Simonsen LC, Slaba TC, Guida P, Rusek A (2020) NASA’s first ground-based Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: Enabling a new era in space radiobiology research. PLoS Biol 18(5): e3000669. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000669     Nine months following sham-irradiation or irradiation and 6 months after the behavioral and cognitive testing, in February 2020, sham-irradiated rats and rats irradiated at 1.5 Gy, in the absence and presence of HU, were quickly killed using a guillotine without anesthesia. The blood was collected in EDTA-containing tubes, centrifugated at 2,000 g for 10 min and the plasma supernatant collected and stored at -80C.     Metabolites were extracted from 100 uL of plasma using cold methanol:water (8:2, v/v). Samples were homogenized and processed for untargeted metabolomics.     Liquid chromatography (LC) was performed using a Shimadzu Nexera system with an Inertsil Phenyl-3 column (4.6 x 150 mm, 100 angstroms, 5 mm; GL Sciences, Rolling Hills Estates, CA, United States) coupled to a quadrupole time-offlight mass spectrometer (Q-TOF) (AB SCIEX, Triple TOF 5600) operated in information-dependent MS/MS acquisition mode. Samples were ordered randomly and multiple quality control samples were included. QC samples were generated by pooling 10 mL aliquots from plasma samples extracts and analyzed along with the samples. Samples were run in the positive and negative ion mode. In case metabolites were present in both ion modes, the mode with the higher peak value was selected for further analysis. The column temperature was held at 50\u000eC and the samples were kept at 10\u000eC. Three types of quality control samples are included in the study: blank controls, pooled sample extracts, and NIST metabolomics standards (SRM 1950 human plasma).",

          "Study Description": "A limitation of simulated space radiation studies is that radiation exposure is not the only environmental challenge astronauts face during missions. Therefore, we characterized behavioral and cognitive performance of male WAG/Rij rats 3 months after sham-irradiation or total body irradiation with a simplified 5-ion mixed beam exposure in the absence or presence of simulated weightlessness using hindlimb unloading (HU) alone. Six months following behavioral and cognitive testing or 9 months following sham-irradiation or total body irradiation, plasma and brain tissues (hippocampus and cortex) were processed to determine whether the behavioral and cognitive effects were associated with long-term alterations in metabolic pathways in plasma and brain. Sham HU, but not irradiated HU, rats were impaired in spatial habituation learning. Rats irradiated with 1.5 Gy showed increased depressive-like behaviors. This was seen in the absence but not presence of HU. Thus, HU has differential effects in sham-irradiated and irradiated animals and specific behavioral measures are associated with plasma levels of distinct metabolites 6 months later. The combined effects of HU and radiation on metabolic pathways in plasma and brain illustrate the complex interaction of environmental stressors and highlights the importance of assessing these interactions. This study contains plasma metabolomics data. The hippocampus metabolomics data are deposited in OSD-833, the cortex metabolomics data in OSD-834, and the behavioral assay data in OSD-835.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "WAG male rats (n equals 69), a substrain of WAG/Rij, separated from the colony at Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO, Rijswijk, Netherlands), in about 1975, and maintained at Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), were shipped to the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Upton, NY. The hindlimb unloading )HU) procedure was initiated 5 days prior to sham-irradiation or irradiation as described below. On Day 1, the rats were randomly grouped to serve as either full weight-bearing on all four limbs, or to be HU via tail suspension with body weight borne on the two front limbs. The HU procedure was a modified version of the one previously published (Wiley et al., 2016). Briefly, rats were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane (2.5–3.0%; 100% oxygen flow rate). While anesthetized, the tail was cleaned using 70% isopropyl alcohol. Benzoin tincture was applied to the lateral surfaces of the tail prior to the placement of strips (1 cm wide by 30 cm long) of adhesive medical traction tape (3M, St. Paul, MN, United States). The tape was placed approximately 1 cm from base of the tail, spanning distally for approximately the next 3/4ths the length of the tail. The free end of the tape was looped through a catch that was part of a custom-build plastic ball bearing swivel. After passing through the swivel, the tape was symmetrically adhered to the other lateral side of the tail in a similar spatial manner. Three pieces of 1/2-in micropore surgical tape (3M, St. Paul, MN, United States) were secured perpendicularly along the traction tape. A 1.56-in stainless oval wire carabiner clip (Nite Ize, Boulder, CO, United States) was attached through a hole on the top portion of the plastic swivel, with the other end of the carabiner clip attached to a zipper hook that slides along a perlon cord (STAS group, BA, Eindhoven, Netherlands). The cord was attached to a clothesline support separator spreader pulley (Blue Hawk, Gilbert, AZ, United States) that slides along a 5/16-in diameter round, solid steel rod (Hillman, Cincinnati, OH, United States). Once the attachment was complete, the zipper lock was adjusted along the perlon cord to lift the hind limbs fully off the substrate with a pitch angle of the thorax and abdomen 30\u000edegree relative to the horizontal substrate plane. Rats quickly recovered from anesthesia and were monitored closely for the next 24 h. Rats maintained under standard gravitational conditions (non-HU) received isoflurane, but were not tail suspended. All HU and non-HU rats were further subgrouped as to receive one of the two radiation doses (0.75 Gy or 1.5 Gy) or sham-irradiation (0 Gy), and all animals were singly housed. Monitoring over the next 5 days was carefully performed to ensure the HU rats had access to food and water and could move smoothly across the cage, despite the hind limbs not touching the substrate. Wet rodent chow and gel packs were provided to ensure hydration. Corrugated cardboard bedding was supplied to permit burrowing for all rats. On Day 5, animals were transferred from HU or non-HU housing to a new plexiglass box (holder) drilled with air holes for radiation or sham-radiation exposure. HU animals remained suspended through the transferring process by removing the plastic ball bearing from the carabiner and relocating the animal to a plastic plexiglass holder (9.5' x 4' x 7.5') where plastic bead chains were attached to the swivel. The new holders were placed into a rigid foam frame allowing six rats (in six holders) to be placed into the beamline simultaneously. The frame accommodated lengths of plastic bead-chains hanging from a top cross bar. One bead chain was looped through the hole in the plastic swivel, and the free end of the bead chain was affixed to itself using a plastic zip tie. The bead chain was then adjusted at the cross bar to ensure a 30 degree of the body of the relative to the plexiglass floor of the holder, with the hind limbs remaining off the floor. Each holder lid contained a cutout section to permit closure with the tail extending upward toward the cross bar. This process was repeated five more times, such that a total six rats were HU and stacked (3 high; with two rats on the bottom, middle, and top levels) within the foam frame. Rats that did not receive HU were placed into similar plexiglass boxes drilled with airholes and stacked into rigid foam frames, but remained full weight-bearing. Their holders were smaller (8' x 4' x 4'), and were aligned in a matrix of three horizontal capsules and four vertical one for irradiation on the beam line (or sham-irradiation). Rats were then transported to the NSRL facility on each irradiation day for sham-irradiation or radiation exposure. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.     After 2 weeks of acclimatization, and at 9 months of age, they were sham-irradiated or irradiated with a standardized, simplified 5-ion exposure prescribed by NASA and referred to as simGCRsim (consisting of rapid, sequential exposure to protons (1000 MeV/n, LET equals 0.2 keV/mm, 35%), 28Si ions (600 MeV/n, LET equals 50.4 keV/mm, 1%), 4He ions (250 MeV/n, LET equals 1.6 keV/mm, 18%), 16O ions (350 MeV/n, LET equals 16.9 keV/mm, 6%), 56Fe ions (600 MeV/n, LET equals 173.8 keV/mm, 1%), and protons (250 MeV/n, LET equals 0.4 keV/mm, 39%). Rats were exposed to 0 or 1.5 Gy) at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at BNL on May 7 or May 8, 2019. The 1.5 Gy cohort included experimental groups of simulated weightlessness using HU alone and HU in combination with radiation. NSRL GCR and SPE simulations are designed to approximate the chronic mixed field exposures in space by means of sequential acute exposures to a variety of ion/energy combinations. The exposure protocols are on the NSRL website: https://www.bnl.gov/nsrl/userguide/simgcrsim.php (SimGCRSim). The dose can be administered either in a single series of exposures lasting approximately an hour or in daily fractions over several weeks. The GCR simulations are described in detail here: Simonsen LC, Slaba TC, Guida P, Rusek A (2020) NASA’s first ground-based Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: Enabling a new era in space radiobiology research. PLoS Biol 18(5): e3000669. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000669     Nine months following sham-irradiation or irradiation and 6 months after the behavioral and cognitive testing, in February 2020, sham-irradiated rats and rats irradiated at 1.5 Gy, in the absence and presence of HU, were quickly killed using a guillotine without anesthesia. The brain was cut along the midline on ice in PBS and the whole hippocampus and whole cortex were dissected as described\n(Raber et al., 2002) and stored at -80 C.     The tissues were homogenized in 300 mL (per 30 mg of tissues) of cold methanol:water (8:2, v/v). From 100 ml of hippocampal homogenates, metabolites were extracted.     Liquid chromatography (LC) was performed using a Shimadzu Nexera system with an Inertsil Phenyl-3 column (4.6 x 150 mm, 100 angstroms, 5 mm; GL Sciences, Rolling Hills Estates, CA, United States) coupled to a quadrupole time-offlight mass spectrometer (Q-TOF) (AB SCIEX, Triple TOF 5600) operated in information-dependent MS/MS acquisition mode. Samples were ordered randomly and multiple quality control samples were included. QC samples were generated by pooling 10 mL aliquots from plasma samples extracts and analyzed along with the samples. Samples were run in the positive and negative ion mode. In case metabolites were present in both ion modes, the mode with the higher peak value was selected for further analysis. The column temperature was held at 50\u000eC and the samples were kept at 10\u000eC. Multiple types of quality control samples are included in the study: : blank controls; QC1, consisting of 10 µL from each hippocampus sample; QC2, consisting of 10 µL from each cortex sample; QC3, a pooled mix of equal volumes of QC1 and QC2; and NIST metabolomics standards (SRM 1950 human plasma).",

          "Study Description": "A limitation of simulated space radiation studies is that radiation exposure is not the only environmental challenge astronauts face during missions. Therefore, we characterized behavioral and cognitive performance of male WAG/Rij rats 3 months after sham-irradiation or total body irradiation with a simplified 5-ion mixed beam exposure in the absence or presence of simulated weightlessness using hindlimb unloading (HU) alone. Six months following behavioral and cognitive testing or 9 months following sham-irradiation or total body irradiation, plasma and brain tissues (hippocampus and cortex) were processed to determine whether the behavioral and cognitive effects were associated with long-term alterations in metabolic pathways in plasma and brain. Sham HU, but not irradiated HU, rats were impaired in spatial habituation learning. Rats irradiated with 1.5 Gy showed increased depressive-like behaviors. This was seen in the absence but not presence of HU. Thus, HU has differential effects in sham-irradiated and irradiated animals and specific behavioral measures are associated with plasma levels of distinct metabolites 6 months later. The combined effects of HU and radiation on metabolic pathways in plasma and brain illustrate the complex interaction of environmental stressors and highlights the importance of assessing these interactions. This study contains hippocampus metabolomics data. The plasma metabolomics data are deposited in OSD-832, the cortex metabolomics data in OSD-834, and the behavioral assay data in OSD-835.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "De-identified peripheral blood buffy coat samples were obtained from healthy human donors from the Stanford University Blood Center. PBMCs were isolated using a Ficoll gradient method.     1x10^4 PBMCs from each condition were counted and loaded on the 10X Genomics Chromium Controller and the libraries were prepared using Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ Reagent Kit v2 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA). The quality of libraries was assessed using Agilent TapeStation 4200, and test-sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 550.     The full sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 by SeqMatic (Fremont, CA).     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.     De-identified peripheral blood buffy coat samples were obtained from healthy human donors from the Stanford University Blood Center. PBMCs were isolated using a Ficoll gradient method. PBMCs were counted and re-suspended in complete media at 1x10^6 cells/ml (RPMI 1640, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 2mM L-Glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1mM non-essential Amino acid,1mM sodium pyruvate, 50uM 2-mercaptoethanol,10mM HEPES).     To generate simulated microgravity, the cell suspension was loaded into 10 ml disposable high aspect ratio vessels (Synthecon, Houston, TX) and rotated at 15 rpm for 25 hours.\nFor the 1G control, the cell suspension was plated in standard 6-well culture plates, as standard static culture plates or culture flasks have been shown to be comparable to static high aspect ratio vessels by others in major immunological assays. 1G and simulated microgravity cultures were simultaneously placed in the same 37 C, 5% CO2 incubator. To stimulate PBMCs, samples were mixed with 1 μM R848 (TLR7/8 agonist, Invivogen, San Diego, CA) after 16 hours, for 9 hours of stimulation.     At the end of each experiment, the cell suspension was quickly collected, spun down at 500 × g, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and used for downstream analysis.     Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Cat  74134, Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's instruction.\nRNA quantity check was conducted by Novogene Co., LTD (CA, US).     Preparation of RNA library was conducted by Novogene Co., LTD (CA, US).     mRNA sequencing was conducted by Novogene Co., LTD (CA, US). About 20 million paired-end 150 bp reads per sample were generated from Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System.     FASTQ raw reads were analyzed using the MTD pipeline. Differential gene expression analysis between groups was done by DESeq2 R package (version 1.36.0) with control for the subject effect. Genes with adjusted p value less than 0.05 and |log2(FoldChange)| greater than 0 were considered as differentially expressed. DEGs with p values less than 0.05 and |Log2FC| greater than 0.5 were used for the IPA canonical pathway analysis. Different from single-cell (SC), to calculate the iAge index for bulk RNAseq, normalized and scaled gene expression was multiplied with the gene’s coefficient in the iAge gene set, then summed for each sample. Cellular senescence was scored using the ssGSEA method on the SenMayo gene set. Cell Type Frequency Changes within PBMCs were predicted by CIBERSORTx Docker image–Fractions Mode version 1.0. Our single-cell RNA-seq data from PBMCs was used to build the SignatureMatrix File as the reference to predict the cell proportion in the bulk RNA-seq data.     astq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.12.1 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.26. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.2 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.2/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Homo Sapiens STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCh38 (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.112.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Homo Sapiens STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to none and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.19.1).",

          "Study Description": "Microgravity is associated with immunological dysfunction, though the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, using single-cell analysis of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exposed to short term (25 hours) simulated microgravity, we characterize altered genes and pathways at basal and stimulated states with a Toll-like Receptor-7/8 agonist. We validate single-cell analysis by RNA sequencing and super-resolution microscopy, and against data from the Inspiration-4 (I4) mission, JAXA (Cell-Free Epigenome) mission, Twins study, and spleens from mice on the International Space Station. Overall, microgravity alters specific pathways for optimal immunity, including the cytoskeleton, interferon signaling, pyroptosis, temperature-shock, innate inflammation (e.g., Coronavirus pathogenesis pathway and IL-6 signaling), nuclear receptors, and sirtuin signaling. Microgravity directs monocyte inflammatory parameters, and impairs T cell and NK cell functionality. Using machine learning, we identify numerous compounds linking microgravity to immune cell transcription, and demonstrate that the flavonol, quercetin, can reverse most abnormal pathways. These results define immune cell alterations in microgravity, and provide opportunities for countermeasures to maintain normal immunity in space.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Ten males participated in a 7-day dry immersion (DI) with neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) (DI+NMES, ages 26–39 years; height 1.74 m [1.70–1.76 m]; body mass 73 kg [70–79 kg]; and body mass index 24 kg/m² [23–26 kg/m²]). During DI+NMES, low-intensity, low-frequency electrical stimulation of the anterior and posterior surfaces of calf and thigh muscles was performed daily at 11:00 for 40–45 minutes. The stimulation protocol was as follows: 1 second of bipolar symmetrical rectangular pulses (1 ms, 25 Hz), followed by a 2-second pause. Every day at 17:00, low-intensity high-frequency electrical stimulation was performed on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the calf muscles, followed by the thigh muscles for 10 minutes. This high-frequency stimulation protocol consisted of 10 seconds of bipolar symmetrical pulses (2.5 kHz with a sinusoidal modulating frequency of 50 Hz), followed by a 50-second pause.     Muscle samples were taken using a Bergstrom needle with aspiration under local anesthesia (2 ml of 2% lidocaine) from the medial part of the vastus lateralis (VL) and soleus (Sol) muscles of the left leg 14 days before and 6 days after DI and DI+NMES (at 10:00, 3 hours after a standardized very light breakfast: 5.2 g protein, 2.7 g fat, 55 g carbohydrates, 1253 kJ). This biopsy time was chosen because various physiological tests were performed immediately after the end of the 7-day dry immersion (not included in this study). The samples were cleared of visible fragments of connective and adipose tissue; part of the fresh tissue was used to assess mitochondrial function, another part was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen to study the transcriptome and proteome profiles, and the last part was embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound (Sakura, USA) and frozen in liquid nitrogen to histological study; all frozen samples were stored at -80 C until further analyses.     A frozen muscle sample (~10-15 mg) was lysed by the RLT buffer (Qiagen, Germany) using a drill homogenizer and total RNA was extracted by a silica spin column (CleanRNA Standard, Evrogen, Russia). RNA concentration and integrity were evaluated by a fluorimetric assay (Qubit 4, ThermoScientific, USA) and capillary electrophoresis (TapeStation, Agilent, Germany), respectively.     Strand-specific RNA libraries were prepared, as described previously, using the NEBNext Ultra II RNA kit (New England Biolabs, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Library efficient concentration was evaluated by qPCR using 5X qPCRmix-HS SYBR kit (Evrogen, Russia)     Single-end sequencing was done by a NextSeq 550 analyzer (Illumina, USA), according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, with a read length of 75 bp (∼60 million reads/sample).     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 13-May-2024.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.4/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Homo sapiens STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCh38. (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.107.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Homo sapiens STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Description": "Low-intensity neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is often used as an alternative to exercise and high-intensity electrical stimulation to prevent the loss of muscle mass, strength, and endurance in spaceflight and in patients with severe chronic diseases. This study assessed the efficiency of low-intensity (~10% of maximal voluntary contraction) combined (low- and high-frequency) electrical stimulation in preventing the negative effects of weekly disuse (dry immersion without [DI, see a related dataset GSE271607] and with [DI+NMES] daily stimulation; 10 males in each group) on the strength and aerobic performance of the ankle plantar flexors and knee extensors, mitochondrial function in permeabilized muscle fibers, and the proteomic (quantitative mass spectrometry-based analysis) and transcriptomic (RNA-sequencing) profiles of the soleus muscle and vastus lateralis muscle. Application of electrical stimulation during dry immersion prevented a decrease in the maximal strength and a slight reduction in aerobic performance of knee extensors, as well as a decrease in maximal ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration and changes in the expression of genes encoding mitochondrial, extracellular matrix, and membrane proteins in the vastus lateralis muscle. In contrast, for the ankle plantar flexors/soleus muscle, electrical stimulation had a positive effect only on maximal mitochondrial respiration, but accelerated the decline in the maximal strength and muscle fiber cross-sectional area, which appears to be associated with the activation of genes regulating the inflammatory response. The data obtained open up broad prospects for the use of low-intensity combined electrical stimulation to prevent the negative effects of disuse for “mixed” muscles, meanwhile, the optimization of the stimulation protocol is required for “slow” muscles. Only data for soleus tissue samples are reported here. See OSD-784 for vastus lateralis tissue data.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "The human natural killer cell line NK-92MI (ATCC® CRL™-2408) was used for initial cytotoxicity experiments. During expansion, cells were cultured in standard tissue culture flasks in Alpha Minimum Essential medium without ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides but with 2 mM L-glutamine and 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate. Additional components included: 0.2 mM inositol; 0.1 mM 2mercaptoethanol; 0.02 mM folic acid; horse serum to a final concentration of 12.5%; fetal bovine serum to a final concentration of 12.5% (This medium formulation will be referred to as “NK medium” from here forward). T-ALL cell line MOLT-4 (ATCC® CRL1582™) and Erythroleukemic cell line K-562 (ATCC® CCL243™) were used as target cells. All cell lines used for the present studies were tested and confirmed to be mycoplasma-negative using the MycoStrip™ Mycoplasma detection kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (InvivoGen US, San Diego, CA, USA). During culture and expansion, these cells were grown in RPMI-1640 + 10% FBS and IMDM + 10% FBS respectively. All cytotoxicity experiments, however, were conducted in complete NK medium, regardless of cell type.\n\nFollowing the initial studies with the NK-92MI cell line, subsequent cytotoxicity experiments and RNA-seq studies were performed using primary NK cells isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteer donors (n  equals 3 donors for cytotoxicity studies and n equals  2 additional donors for RNA-seq studies; in all cases, donors were males 25–35 years of age; blood was collected by a physician in accordance with an IRB approved by Wake Forest University Health Sciences). In short, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from 20 mL of whole blood using HistopaqueTM-1077 (Sigma Diagnostics, Livonia, MI, USA). Activation and preferential expansion of NK cells was conducted using NK MACS® Medium (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA, USA), supplemented with 5% Human AB Serum (Corning Life Sciences, Durham, NC, USA) and 500 IU/mL Human Recombinant IL-2 (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada), using the manufacturer’s protocol. Following the course of activation and expansion in tissue culture flasks under conditions of normal gravity, NK cells were isolated using a commercially available human NK Cell Isolation Kit in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (MACS—Miltenyi Biotec). Isolated human NK cells were placed back into NK expansion media and immediately used for cytotoxicity assays, as detailed below. Cell density and viability of all cell types were assessed by manual counting of Trypan Blue-stained aliquots of each population on a hemacytometer.     PBMCs were isolated from whole blood, and NK cells were then immediately isolated from PBMCs. Isolated NK cells were directly suspended in NK MACS Medium and transferred to HARVs under conditions of normal and simulated microgravity for 24 h using Synthecon’s Rotating Cell Culture System (RCCS) in conjunction with High Aspect Ratio Vessels (HARVs).     RNA was immediately isolated from each cell population.     RNA was immediately isolated from each cell population using the RNeasy plus kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Germantown MD, USA). The quantity of the RNA extracts was determined using a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer, and the integrity of each extract was determined using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation and reagents.     cDNA libraries were then prepared from 50 ng of each RNA extract using a NEXTFLEX Combo-Seq mRNA/miRNA Kit (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Libraries were quantified using a KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Roche Sequencing and Life Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA), with average fragment length determined by a 4200 TapeStation System (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Libraries were normalized prior to pooling.     The pooled libraries were sequenced using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 System (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), generating 76-bp single-end reads.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 13-May-2024.",

Because of the potential for increased cancer risk from astronaut exposure to space radiation, we determined whether microgravity present during spaceflight affects the body's defenses against leukemogenesis. Human NK cells were cultured for 48 h under normal gravity and simulated microgravity (sμG), and cytotoxicity against K-562 (CML) and MOLT-4 (T-ALL) cells was measured using standard methodology or under continuous sμG. This brief exposure to sμG markedly reduced NK cytotoxicity against both leukemias, and these deleterious effects were more pronounced in continuous sμG. RNA-seq performed on NK cells from two additional healthy donors provided insight into the mechanism(s) by which sμG reduced cytotoxicity. Given our prior report of space radiation-induced human T-ALL in vivo, the reduced cytotoxicity against MOLT-4 is striking and raises the possibility that μG may increase astronaut risk of leukemogenesis during prolonged missions beyond LEO.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Sarcopenia Clinical Samples: As a basis for comparison, we further compared the transcriptomes of microgravity samples to that of banked human vastus lateralis muscle total RNA samples. Total RNA from 4 healthy and 4 sarcopenia donors (2 males and 2 females per group) were obtained from University of Kentucky Center for Muscle Biology with approval from the Institutional Review Board (Protocol  46746). Samples were considered to have sarcopenia based on cutoffs for the relative skeletal muscle (RSM) index, which is defined as muscle mass normalized to stature squared (kg/m^2). Females with RSM less than 5.46 kg/m^2 were considered to have sarcopenia, whereas RSM greater than 5.46 kg/m^2 were considered to be healthy. Males with RSM less than 7.26 kg/m^2 were considered to have sarcopenia, whereas males with RSM greater than 7.26 kg/m^2 were considered to be healthy.     Total RNA were isolated using the AllPrep Mini Kit (Qiagen). Total RNA samples showing good RNA integrity by Agilent Bioanalyzer analysis were processed for library preparation and bulk RNA Sequencing by Novogene Corporation.     In brief, mRNA was purified from total RNA using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. After fragmentation, the first strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primers, followed by the second strand cDNA synthesis. Non-directional library preparation was completed after end repair, A-tailing, adapter ligation, size selection, amplification, and purification. The library was validated using Qubit assay (Fisher Scientific) and quantitative PCR, along with Agilent bioanalyzer analysis of size distribution detection.     The libraries were pooled and sequenced using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S4 platform. The paired-end reads were then generated.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.12.1 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.26. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 13-May-2024.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.2 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.2/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Homo Sapiens STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCh38 (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.112.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Homo Sapiens STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to none and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.19.1).",

          "Study Description": "Microgravity has been shown to lead to both muscle atrophy and impaired muscle regeneration. The purpose was to study the efficacy of microgravity to model impaired muscle regeneration in an engineered muscle platform and then to demonstrate the feasibility of performing drug screening in this model. Engineered human muscle was launched to the International Space Station National Laboratory, where the effect of microgravity exposure for 7 days was examined by transcriptomics and proteomics approaches. Gene set enrichment analysis of engineered muscle cultured in microgravity, compared to normal gravity conditions, highlighted a metabolic shift toward lipid and fatty acid metabolism, along with increased apoptotic gene expression. The addition of pro-regenerative drugs, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and a 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase inhibitor (15-PGDH-i), partially inhibited the effects of microgravity. In summary, microgravity mimics aspects of impaired myogenesis, and the addition of these drugs could partially inhibit the effects induced by microgravity. Only data for vastus lateralis tissue samples are reported here. See OSD-781 for myoblast data.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Universal kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Gel matrix cryotubes containing the cells of interest were taken out of -80°C and 1mL of QIAzol reagent was added to the tubes. Each sample contained 300-800 µL of gel matrix and approximately 500,000 cells. While the gel matrix thawed in QIAzol, the solution was pipetted and vortexed until fully dissolved. The lysate was passed through a QIAshredder column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) to further homogenize the cells. 100 µL of gDNA eliminator solution was added. The resulting lysate from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 30-50 µL RNAse free H2O. Concentration of all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR kit following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat 4456739, v92), Mix 1 or Mix 2, were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol.

GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA ribo-depletion and library preparation was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN higher than 6.5 (average RIN of 8.7). Index adapters used were at 1.5 µM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 PCR cycles were performed. Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing). Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as follows: Read 1: 151bp, Index1: 17bp(8bp index + 9bp UMI), Index2: 8bp Read 2: 151bp. PhiX was included as an internal control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Homo sapiens STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 101, genome version GRCh38 (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.101.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Homo sapiens + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.1.2) with tximport (version 1.22.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. The data was normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential gene expression (DGE) analysis. Samples were grouped 3 different ways for pairwise DGE analysis as follows: NOmiR, NOmiR_DEV_v_MAT, and miR. NOmiR and NOmiR_DEV_v_MAT groupings both contain all HUVEC samples exposed to simulated deep space radiation with and without antagomirs. The miR grouping contains HUVEC samples that were overexpressed with miR-2392 or control. For NOmiR, samples were grouped into one of the following 6 groups: 1) D_0.0Gy_NOantag: Angiogenesis model, sham-irradiated, no treatment; 2) D_0.5Gy_antag: Angiogenesis model, 0.5Gy irradiated, antagomir treatment; 3) D_0.5Gy_NOantag: Angiogenesis model, 0.5Gy irradiated, no treatment; 4) M_0.0Gy_NOantag: Mature model, sham-irradiated, no treatment; 5) M_0.5Gy_antag: Mature model, 0.5Gy irradiated, antagomir treatment; 6) M_0.5Gy_NOantag: Mature model, 0.5Gy irradiated, no treatment. For NOmiR_DEV_v_MAT, samples were grouped into one of the following 2 groups: 1) DEV: All angiogenesis model samples; 2) MAT: All mature model samples (except those treated with either miR-2392 mimic or control). For miR, samples were grouped into one of the following 2 groups: 1) miR_2392_control: Mature model, miR-2392 mimic control treated; 2) miR_2392_mimic: Mature model, miR-2392 mimic treated.\n\nDifferential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.8.4), PANTHER.db (v1.0.11), and org.Hs.eg.db (v3.15.0).     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Homo sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.4/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Homo sapiens STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCh38 (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.107.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Homo sapiens + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. The data were normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor*. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.15.0). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis.html report. *ERCC-normalized data are available upon request.     Cell culture for GCR experiments: Prior to culturing 3D microvessels, HUVEC (Lonza Inc, Allendale, NJ, USA) were cultured as 2D monolayers in complete endothelial basal medium (EBM; Lonza Inc., Allendale, NJ, USA), containing EGM medium (serum free) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), human epidermal growth factor, hydrocortisone, and bovine brain extract. Cells were kept in a humidified incubator (5% CO2, 95% air) and the medium was changed twice a week. All cells used for experiments were cells thawed from a fresh vial. 3D HUVEC vessel cell model for GCR experiments: In this study, 3D cell culture was performed according to the method initially described by Davis et al. (Davis, G. E. and Camarillo, C. W. An alpha 2 beta 1 integrin-dependent pinocytic mechanism involving intracellular vacuole formation and coalescence regulates capillary lumen and tube formation in three-dimensional collagen matrix. Exp Cell Res 224, 39–51 (1996)) with modifications described in Grabham et al. (Grabham, P., Hu, B., Sharma, P. and Geard, C. Effects of ionizing radiation on three-dimensional human vessel models: differential effects according to radiation quality and cellular development. Radiat Res 175, 21–28 (2011)). Briefly, a collagen gel solution (Rat tail Collagen Type 1, BD Biosciences, Bedford MA) was prepared on ice by mixing together the following stock solutions: 0.35% collagen solution, 10Å~ M199 medium, and 1 M HEPES (pH 7.4) in a ratio of 8:1:1 by (volume). This solution was then mixed with matrigel (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) in a ratio of 3:1 by (volume). HUVECs grown in EGM on 2D cell culture dishes (80–90% confluence) were detached with a trypsin solution (0.025%) and resuspended in EGM-2 (Lonza Inc, Allendale, NJ, USA). The cell solution was mixed with the gel solution in a ratio 1:5 (by volume). The resulting cell suspension contained a final cell suspension of 1x10^6 cells/ml. 25 μl was dropped onto the cell growing surface inside a tissue culture flask (T25) (Corning) and allowed to gel at 37°C for 30 min. The gel matrices were then overlaid with EGM-2 medium for 7 days with daily media changes. EBM-2 consists of EGM-2 media supplemented with 2% FBS, human fibroblast growth factor B (hFGF-B), human epidermal growth factor (hEGF), human vascular endothelial cell growth factor (hVEGF), long R insulin-like growth factor 1 (R3-IGF-1), ascorbic acid, hydrocortisone and heparin. 50 nM Phorbol 12- Myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Millipore Sigma) was also added to the growth media. Cells embedded in 200–300 μm thick gel matrices were incubated at 37°C in a humidified incubator (5% CO2, 95% air) for the times indicated. The medium was refreshed every 24 h or as otherwise stated in individual experiments. For mature microvessels, cells were cultured for 6 days and treated with antagomirs (AUM biotech) (0.5 µM each) 24 hours before radiation exposure then fixed 24 hours later. For the angiogenesis model, cultures were irradiated on day one and cultured for 6 more days before fixation. 3D human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) model for miR-2392 experiments: Mature human 3D microvascular tissue models are grown by seeding- human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Lonza Cat  CC-2519) into a collagen/matrigel mixture as described above. Briefly, HUVECs were first grown in EGM Endothelial Cell Growth Medium (Cat  CC-3124), then cells (1 x 10^6/ml) were embedded into a collagen/matrigel mixture (Cat  354236 and Cat  356230). Microvessels are grown in EGM-2 Endothelial Cell Growth Medium (Cat  CC-3162) plus 50 nM Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate: (PMA) (Cat  524400) for 7 days to form tubular microvessels before irradiations. These tissue models were used to study vascular changes associated with the miR-2392 mimics. The 3D HUVEC tissues were incubated according to the manufacturer’s instructions with the miR-2392 mimics or control lentivirus particles (MOI 1) for 48h. Specifically, we used the shMIMIC Lentiviral microRNA hsa-miR-2392 hCMV-TurboGFP UHT kit with the SMARTvector Non-targeting hCMV-TurboGFP Control Particles for the control vehicle transfection (Horizon Discovery Biosciences Limited, Cat  : VSH7357 and VSC10236).     Irradiation of the microvessel model were conducted at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL, Upton, NY). Samples were positioned in the plateau region of the Bragg curve and irradiated at room temperature. Dosimetry was performed by the NSRL physics staff. For microvessel models, cultures were seeded at Columbia University in New York City then transported to BNL the same day. Irradiations were carried out the following day (Day 1) at NSRL. A 20cm x 20cm beam was utilized. Since the heavy-ion beam at NSRL is horizontal, flasks containing 5 ml of medium were upended to a vertical position for a few minutes during irradiation. All cultures were irradiated with 0.5 Gy of simplified simulated GCR (referred to as GCR). The irradiation was used with ions, energy, and doses determined by a NASA consensus formula for 5 ions: protons at 1000 MeV, 28Si at 600 MeV/n,4He at 250 MeV/n, 16O at 350 MeV/n, 56Fe at 600 MeV/n, and protons at 250 MeV, in the following proportions – 1000MeV protons at 34.8%, 250 MeV protons at 39.3%, 28Si at 1.1%, 4He at 18%, 16O at 5.8%, and 56Fe at 1%. This mixture is the simplified version of the full GCR simulation and represents the proportions of ions found in space and thus translates to exploratory class missions48. The low LET particles (Protons and Helium) make up the majority of charged particles although high LET ions generally have a greater relative biological effect (RBE). NSRL GCR and SPE simulations are designed to approximate the chronic mixed field exposures in space by means of sequential acute exposures to a variety of ion/energy combinations. The exposure protocols are on the NSRL website: https://www.bnl.gov/nsrl/userguide/simgcrsim.php (SimGCRSim).  The dose can be administered either in a single series of exposures lasting approximately an hour or in daily fractions over several weeks.  The GCR simulations are described in detail here: Simonsen LC, Slaba TC, Guida P, Rusek A (2020) NASA’s first ground-based Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: Enabling a new era in space radiobiology research. PLoS Biol 18(5): e3000669. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000669     For the tissue culture for GCR experiments, the T25 flasks were washed with PBS and the gel was shaken off the surface. The gel was then pipetted into the cryotube and frozen. The tissue constructs used for miR-2392 mimics were dissolved by submerging in TRIzol (ThermoFisher Cat  15596026) 48 hours post transfection, without any fixation or homogenization.",

We performed RNA-sequencing and transcriptomic analysis on our established 3D microvessel cell cultures (i.e. 3D Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs)) exposed to simulated deep space radiation (0.5 Gy of Galactic Cosmic Radiation) with and without the antagonists to three microRNAs (i.e. antagomirs). In addition we have an additional set of samples studying the impact a specific miRNA, miR-2392, which was overexpressed in the 3D tissues. miR-2392 is known to be involved in different diseases and we were studying the impact of miR-2392 overexpression in the 3D microvessel tissues.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Blood samples were collected in tubes at 15:00-16:00 on 1 day before staying at isolation and confinement facility and day 14th during. Whole blood samples were incubated at room temperature for 24 hours after collecting and stored at -80℃ until analysis.     Fourteen days confinement study was conducted 2 times. In each experiment, 8 male subjects were stayed in an isolation and confinement facility at Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.     RNA was extracted using the PAXgene Blood RNA System Kit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.     Cyanine-3 (Cy3) labeled aRNA was prepared from RNA using the Low Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit and the RNA Spike-In Kit (1 color) (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by RNeasy column purification (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). Dye incorporation and cRNA yield were checked with the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer.     1.5 ug of Cy3-labelled cRNA (specific activity greater than 10.0 pmol Cy3/ug cRNA) was fragmented at 60°C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 0.1ml containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturer's instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 0.1 ml of 2x Agilent hybridization buffer was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to Agilent Human Gene Expression 4x44K v2 Microarray Kit (G4845A) for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately by brief centrifugation.     Slides were scanned on the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2505B).     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7112 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Agilent_1-channel/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7112_Versions/GL-DPPD-7112.md), using NF_MAAgilent1ch version 1.0.0 (GitHub link coming soon). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.0). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3). Raw data quality assurance density, pseudo image, MA, and foreground-background plots were generated using limma (version 3.50.3), and boxplots were generated using ggplot2 (version 3.4.0). The raw intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the limma (version 3.50.3) quantile method. Normalized data quality assurance density, pseudo image, and MA plots were generated using limma (version 3.50.3), and boxplots were generated using using ggplot2 (version 3.4.0). Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probe using biomaRt (version 2.50.0), Ensembl database (ensembl.org, release 107). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probe to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned for every probe that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Description": "The effects of short-term confinement on gene expression profiles in blood were evaluated. Fourteen days confinement study was conducted 2 times. In each experiment, 8 male subjects were stayed in an isolation and confinement facility at Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. DNA microarray of extracted RNA from whole blood samples revealed that the expression levels of 3,659 genes were significantly altered by the 14-day confinement. The changes in gene expression profiles were not exactly the same as those in response to the other stress conditions, such as chronic psychological stress and spaceflight. In particular, 7 genes, LIN9, AK125040.1, MGC45922, C9orf173-AS1, OR1P1P, KRTAP10-12, and ARFRP1, responded to the confinement prominently. Therefore, the analysis of expression levels of these genes might be useful to assess the stress responses of human body to the confinement. In addition, biological interpretation of the alteration of gene expression profiles with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis indicated that 14-day confinement stimulated various signaling related to pro inflammation and leukocyte extravasation but suppressed apoptosis signaling. In agreement with the interpretation, the decrease of white blood cells in blood was confirmed during the confinement. On the other hand, red blood cells and platelets did not decrease. These results suggest that 14-day confinement is likely to induce shift of white blood cells from “the circulating pool” to “the marginated pool”.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Twelve recreationally active young adults (age: 22.1 (2.9) years; height: 1.78 (0.03) m; body mass (72.1) kg) took part in this study. Inclusion criteria were 18 to 35 years of age, body mass index between 20 and 28 kg m2 and involvement in recreational physical activities (1–3 times/week). Exclusion criteria were sedentary and very active (greater than 3 training/week) individuals, smokers, history of deep venous thrombosis and acute or chronic musculoskeletal, metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. The protocol included 1 day of familiarization with the experimental procedure and measurements at baseline (LS0), after 10 days of ULLS (LS10) and 21 days of AR based on resistance exercise (AR21). The duration of the AR phase was based on previous observations that full recovery of muscle function after a 2-week lower limb immobilization required a retraining period lasting twice as long (4 weeks) as the unloading phase. An intermediate measurement of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) was performed after 10 days of AR (AR10) to verify how much force had been recovered with respect to baseline values. Final measurements were performed 3 days after the last training session of the AR phase to avoid potential muscle fatigue. Participants were asked to maintain their habitual diet period throughout the entire intervention period and refrain from coffee and alcohol intake and any form of exercise during the 24 h preceding the data collection at each time point. Each participant performed all the tests at the same time of the day to minimize possible influences of circadian variations.     In each participant, a vastus lateralis muscle biopsy (∼150 mg) was collected using a Weil–Blakesley conchotome at ∼2 cm from the motor point. Two ml of lidocaine (2%) were injected in the area of the sampling and a small incision of muscle and fascia was performed. Muscle samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.     The RNA was extracted from ∼10–15 mg of the muscle tissues by Reprocell (Beltsville, MD, USA) using a Norgen Animal Tissue RNA Purification Kit no. 257 (Norgen Biotek Corp, Ontario, CA). The RNA integrity score (RIN) average was 9.21 (range: 7.90–9.86). The concentration of extracted RNA ranged from 34 to 166 ng/μl per sample.     The libraries were made using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep protocol from Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA). This protocol involves the removal of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) using biotinylated, target-specific oligos combined with Ribo-Zero rRNA removal beads. The RNA was fragmented pieces and the cleaved RNA fragments were copied into first-strand cDNA using reverse transcriptase and random primers, followed by second-strand cDNA synthesis using DNA polymerase I and RNase H. The resulting double-strand cDNA was used as the input to a standard Illumina library prep with end-repair, adapter ligation and PCR amplification being performed to provide a library ready for sequencing.     31 totalRNA-Seq samples were pooled and sequenced on 2 lanes of a NovaSeq 6000 S4 XP run using Illumina(R) Stranded Total RNA Prep, Ligation with Ribo-Zero Plus and paired-end sequencing.     Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.3 with modifications to the workflow code to trim for Nextera adaptors instead of Illumina adaptors (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.3/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Homo sapiens STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCh38 (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.107.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Homo sapiens STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Description": "Electrophysiological alterations of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and motor unit potential (MUP) with unloading are poorly studied. We aimed to investigate these aspects and the underlying molecular mechanisms with short-term unloading and active recovery (AR). Eleven healthy males underwent a 10-day unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS) period, followed by 21-day AR based on resistance exercise. Quadriceps femoris (QF) cross-sectional area (CSA) and isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) were evaluated. Intramuscular electromyographic recordings were obtained during 10% and 25% MVC isometric contractions from the vastus lateralis (VL). Biomarkers of NMJ molecular instability (serum c-terminal agrin fragment, CAF), axonal damage (neurofilament light chain) and denervation status were assessed from blood samples and VL biopsies. NMJ and ion channel transcriptomic profiles were investigated by RNA-sequencing. QF CSA and MVC decreased with ULLS. Increased CAF and altered NMJ transcriptome with unloading suggested the emergence of NMJ molecular instability, which was not associated with impaired NMJ transmission stability. Instead, increased MUP complexity and decreased motor unit firing rates were found after ULLS. Downregulation of ion channel gene expression was found together with increased neurofilament light chain concentration and partial denervation. The AR period restored most of these neuromuscular alterations. In conclusion, the human NMJ is destabilized at the molecular level but shows functional resilience to a 10-day unloading period at least at relatively low contraction intensities. However, MUP properties are altered by ULLS, possibly due to alterations in ion channel dynamics and initial axonal damage and denervation. These changes are fully reversed by 21 days of AR. KEY POINTS: We used integrative electrophysiological and molecular approaches to comprehensively investigate changes in neuromuscular integrity and function after a 10-day unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS), followed by 21 days of active recovery in young healthy men, with a particular focus on neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and motor unit potential (MUP) properties alterations. After 10-day ULLS, we found significant NMJ molecular alterations in the absence of NMJ transmission stability impairment. These findings suggest that the human NMJ is functionally resilient against insults and stresses induced by short-term disuse at least at relatively low contraction intensities, at which low-threshold, slow-type motor units are recruited. Intramuscular electromyography analysis revealed that unloading caused increased MUP complexity and decreased motor unit firing rates, and these alterations could be related to the observed changes in skeletal muscle ion channel pool and initial and partial signs of fibre denervation and axonal damage. The active recovery period restored these neuromuscular changes.",

          "Managing NASA Center": "",
          "Study Description": "There are unique stressors in the spaceflight environment. Exposure to such stressors is associated with adverse effects on astronauts' health, including increased cancer and cardiovascular disease risks. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs, i.e., exosomes) play a vital role in intercellular communication and regulate various biological processes contributing to their role in disease pathogenesis. To assess whether spaceflight alters sEVs transcriptome profile, sEVs were isolated from the blood plasma of 3 astronauts at two different time points: 10 days before launch (L-10) and 3 days after return (R+3) from the Shuttle mission. Human adult ventricular cardiomyocyte cells (AC16) were treated with L-10 and R+3 astronauts-derived exosomes for 24 hours. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed for gene expression profiling using Affymetrix microarrays. Enrichment analysis was performed using Enrichr. Transcription factor enrichment analysis using the ENCODE/ChEA Consensus TF database identified gene sets related to the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and Vitamin D receptor (VDR) in AC16 cells treated with R+3 compared to cells treated with L-10 astronauts-derived exosomes. Further analysis of the histone modifications using datasets from the Roadmap Epigenomics Project confirmed enrichment in gene sets related to the H3K27me3 repressive mark. Interestingly, analysis of previously published H3K27me3–chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) ENCODE datasets showed enrichment of H3K27me3 in the VDR promoter. Collectively, our results suggest that astronaut-derived sEVs may epigenetically repress the expression of the VDR in human adult cardiomyocytes c by promoting the activation of the PRC2 complex and H3K27me3 levels. Gene expression was measured in untreated (n equals 3) and exosome-treated (n equals 6) AC16 human cardiomyocyte cell line. Cell were treated with exosomes isolated from 3 austonauts at two different time points: 10 days before mission (n equals 3) and 3 days upon return from mission (n equals 3).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Methods were performed in accordance with relevant regulations and guidelines. The study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards at Johnson Space Center and Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), Houston, TX. Subject recruitment was done at BCM and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.\n\nThe study population was a pool of neurological patients with suspected IIH, requiring diagnostic or therapeutic LP. Subjects were recruited on the basis of the modified Dandy criteria for IIH and the IIH treatment trial, 17 consisting in the presence of signs and symptoms of raised ICP (higher than 20 cm H2O  equals to14.7 mmHg), absence of localized findings except those from increased ICP, or abnormal neuroimaging except for empty sella turcica and distended optic nerve sheath. The subject was awake and alert, and no other cause of increased ICP was present. For the LP, the subjects lay in the lateral decubitus position with legs slightly extended. Once the needle was in the thecal sac at the L3-L4 or L4-L5 region, the manometer was observed for the presence of pulse and respiratory waves to indicate patent communication between needle and subarachnoid space. Next, the opening pressure was monitored over a period of 5 min, ICP was measured every minute, and the average calculated. CSF was then drained as per the normal clinical procedure. A volume of 5 ml was collected specifically for the purpose of this study.\n\nOf 22 subjects recruited, ICP was not able to be determined in one of them due to technically difficult LP. That subject was therefore not included in the study and data collection was completed in 21 subjects. The cut off between normal and elevated ICP was established at 18 mm Hg. Patients were grouped into 'normal to moderately high ICP' subjects (less than 18 mmHg) and high ICP (higher than 18 mmHg). Seven 'normal to mild ICP' and 14 high ICP subjects were compared in the study.\n\nAdditionally, subjects had 10 ml blood drawn for plasma separation in K2EDTA BD Vacutainer® blood collection tubes with gel barrier. All plasma and CSF samples were pre-filtered through a 0.8-µm syringe filter prior to microvesicular processing, aliquoted and stored at −80 °C in a freezer at the Center for Space Medicine at BCM and then shipped to the Exosome Diagnostics facilities in Cambridge, MA.     CSF at volume of 5 ml and plasma at volume of 4 ml (pre-filtered) were used for exosome isolation by the ExosomeDx spin column-based method (expRNAeasy SerumPlasma Maxi kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The method allows the reproducible isolation of high-quality exosome-specific RNA, which includes both mRNA and miRNA fractions. Briefly, the pre-filtered sample was mixed 1:1 with 2× binding buffer (XBP) and added to the exoEasy membrane affinity column to bind the exosomes to the membrane. After centrifugation, the flow-through was discarded and wash buffer (XWP) was added to the column to wash off non-specifically retained material. After another centrifugation and discarding of the flow-through, the vesicles were lysed by adding QIAzol solution and following the addition of chloroform, thorough mixing and centrifugation to separate organic and aqueous phases, the aqueous phase was recovered and mixed with ethanol. The sample–ethanol mixture was added to an RNAeasy MinElute spin column and centrifuged. The column was washed once with buffer RWT, and then twice with buffer RPE followed by elution of RNA in a final volume of 14 μL water.     The RT reaction was carried out in a final volume of 20 μL containing: 14 μL RNA sample, 2 μL Superscript reverse transcriptase enzyme mix, and 4 μL VILO Master Mix (which includesRNaseOUT™ Recombinant Ribonuclease Inhibitor, MgCl2, dNTPs and random primers). The reaction proceeded for 10 min at 95 °C, 15 s at 95 °C, 4 min at 60 °C, followed by inactivation at 95 °C for 10 min.\n\nPre-amplification was done using Human Inflammation PreAmp Primers (Pool A or B) 5 μL, TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix 10 μL, and 5 μL of RT product (cDNA) in a final volume of 50 μL. The temperature sequence was the following: 10 min at 95 °C, 15 s at 95 °C and 4 min at 60 °C (for 14 cycles), followed by inactivation at 95 °C for 10 min. The pre-amplified samples were stored at 4 °C until the PCR was performed.     The TaqMan OpenArray Human Inflammation Panel (Applied Biosystems, ThermoFisher Scientific) was used for final PCR detection. These contain TaqMan gene expression assays dried down in 384-well TaqMan Array microfluidic cards targeting pathway relevant gene targets. The panel covers 586 genes that have been studied as targets for a range of inflammatory diseases, plus 21 endogenous control genes.\n\nPreAmp products for each sample were mixed and diluted 1:10 with 0.1× TE pH equals to 8.0. For each sample, 35 μL of 2× TaqMan® OpenArray Real-Time PCR Master Mix was mixed with 35 μL mixed, diluted PreAmp. 5 μL of each reaction mixture was pipetted into each of 12 wells on an OpenArray 384-well sample plate. Samples were loaded onto OpenArray plates using the standard Accufill™ protocol. Amplification was performed according to the protocol established for the TaqMan® OpenArray Human Inflammation Panel with the QuantStudio 12 K Flex Real-time PCR system.     The mRNA data comprises cycle threshold (Ct) values from the OpenArray QuantStudio™ 12 K Flex Real-time PCR system, which is converted to gene expression levels for a panel of 607 inflammation-related genes and endogenous control genes. The miRNA data set consists of 754 different miRNAs. Both data sets were processed using the R statistical programming environment. Missing data points were assigned ‘undetermined’, indicating sequence abundances below the detection limit of the OpenArray platform. Quantile normalization was applied to data sets to adjust for technical variation and to make data points comparable among each other. Features or targets with greater than 10 undetermined values were removed from the analysis. An additional filtering step was performed to remove features showing little or no variation across samples since these targets with relatively constant Ct levels are less likely to be differentially expressed. This was achieved removing features with an interquartile range of less than 2. A Mann–Whitney test was performed to compare the samples from patients with elevated and normal ICP. Profiling hundreds of genes at the same time represents a large multiple hypothesis-testing problem from the statistical perspective. While typically this is adjusted by computing false discovery rates (FDR), in this case, however, due to the low number of samples, the multiple testing correction was not applied (since none of the targets showed less than 15% FDR).     Reverse transcription (RT) of miRNA was performed using the Megaplex™ RT Primers (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) to prepare cDNA for real-time PCR analysis on a TaqMan® MicroRNA Array, including a pre-amplification step. Collectively, the Human Pool Set v3.0 containing two Megaplex™ RT Primer Pools, Pools A v2.1 and B v3.0 cover 754 unique microRNAs. The RT reaction for each primer pool was set as follows: 1× Megaplex RT Primers (Pool A or B), 2 mM dNTPs (with dTTP), 10 U/μL MultiScribe reverse transcriptase, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1× RT buffer, 0.25 U/ μL RNAse inhibitor, in a final volume of 15 μL per reaction. The reaction was run through the temperature sequence per the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nPreamplification was performed in a 50 μL reaction with a 10 μL aliquot of the RT reaction as a template, 1× TaqMan® PreAmp Master Mix and 1× Megaplex™ PreAmp Primers (Pool A or Pool B), in a temperature cycling (16 cycles) according to the manufacturer. Pre-amplified samples were diluted 1:10 in 0.1× TE pH 8.0. The TaqMan® OpenArray® Human MicroRNA Panel was used for final PCR detection.     In this final step, the DNA polymerase of the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix amplifies the specific cDNA targets using sequence-specific primers and probe on the TaqMan microRNA Array. 25 µL TaqMan OpenArray Real-Time PCR Master Mix and 13 µL 0.1× buffer TE pH 8.0 were loaded into each of two adjacent wells per sample on a clean 96-well plate. For each sample, 12 µL of diluted Pool A PreAmp was pipetted into one well of each pair and 12 µL of diluted Pool B PreAmp was pipetted into the other well for a total volume of 50 µL in each well. For each sample and primer pool set (Pool A or Pool B), 5 µL of each reaction mixture was pipetted into each of eight wells on an OpenArray 384-well sample plate. Samples were loaded onto OpenArray plates using the standard Accufill protocol. Amplification was performed according to the protocol established for the TaqMan® OpenArray Human MicroRNA panel.",

          "Study Description": "The visual impairment and intracranial pressure (VIIP) syndrome is a neuro-ophthalmologic condition described in astronauts returning from long duration space missions. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is characterized by a chronic elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) in the absence of an intracranial mass lesion. Because VIIP and IIH share some neurologic and ophthalmologic manifestations, the latter might be used as a model to study some of the processes underlying VIIP. This work constitutes a preliminary investigation of the molecular pathways associated with the elevation of ICP in IIH. Gene expression signatures were obtained from exosomes collected from CSF and plasma in patients with possible signs of IIH. The gene expression targets focused on inflammatory genes and miRNAs. The results suggest that inflammatory cytokine-driven processes and immune cell migration are activated when ICP is elevated in IIH patients, either as a cause or effect of the ICP increase. Several miRNAs appear to be involved in this response, among which miR-9 and miR-16 are upregulated in CSF and plasma of higher ICP subjects. This study provides evidence in support of neurophysiological alterations and neuro-immunomodulation in this condition. If similar changes are seen in astronauts manifesting with the VIIP syndrome, an underlying pathophysiological basis may be discovered.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "CSF at volume of 5 ml and plasma at volume of 4 ml (pre-filtered) were used for exosome isolation by the ExosomeDx spin column-based method (expRNAeasy SerumPlasma Maxi kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The method allows the reproducible isolation of high-quality exosome-specific RNA, which includes both mRNA and miRNA fractions. Briefly, the pre-filtered sample was mixed 1:1 with 2× binding buffer (XBP) and added to the exoEasy membrane affinity column to bind the exosomes to the membrane. After centrifugation, the flow-through was discarded and wash buffer (XWP) was added to the column to wash off non-specifically retained material. After another centrifugation and discarding of the flow-through, the vesicles were lysed by adding QIAzol solution and following the addition of chloroform, thorough mixing and centrifugation to separate organic and aqueous phases, the aqueous phase was recovered and mixed with ethanol. The sample–ethanol mixture was added to an RNAeasy MinElute spin column and centrifuged. The column was washed once with buffer RWT, and then twice with buffer RPE followed by elution of RNA in a final volume of 14 μL water.     The RT reaction was carried out in a final volume of 20 μL containing: 14 μL RNA sample, 2 μL Superscript reverse transcriptase enzyme mix, and 4 μL VILO Master Mix (which includesRNaseOUT™ Recombinant Ribonuclease Inhibitor, MgCl2, dNTPs and random primers). The reaction proceeded for 10 min at 95 °C, 15 s at 95 °C, 4 min at 60 °C, followed by inactivation at 95 °C for 10 min. Pre-amplification was done using Human Inflammation PreAmp Primers (Pool A or B) 5 μL, TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix 10 μL, and 5 μL of RT product (cDNA) in a final volume of 50 μL. The temperature sequence was the following: 10 min at 95 °C, 15 s at 95 °C and 4 min at 60 °C (for 14 cycles), followed by inactivation at 95 °C for 10 min. The pre-amplified samples were stored at 4 °C until the PCR was performed.     The TaqMan OpenArray Human Inflammation Panel (Applied Biosystems, ThermoFisher Scientific) was used for final PCR detection. These contain TaqMan gene expression assays dried down in 384-well TaqMan Array microfluidic cards targeting pathway relevant gene targets. The panel covers 586 genes that have been studied as targets for a range of inflammatory diseases, plus 21 endogenous control genes. PreAmp products for each sample were mixed and diluted 1:10 with 0.1× TE pH equals to 8.0. For each sample, 35 μL of 2× TaqMan® OpenArray Real-Time PCR Master Mix was mixed with 35 μL mixed, diluted PreAmp. 5 μL of each reaction mixture was pipetted into each of 12 wells on an OpenArray 384-well sample plate. Samples were loaded onto OpenArray plates using the standard Accufill™ protocol. Amplification was performed according to the protocol established for the TaqMan® OpenArray Human Inflammation Panel with the QuantStudio 12 K Flex Real-time PCR system.     The mRNA data comprises cycle threshold (Ct) values from the OpenArray QuantStudio™ 12 K Flex Real-time PCR system, which is converted to gene expression levels for a panel of 607 inflammation-related genes and endogenous control genes. The miRNA data set consists of 754 different miRNAs. Both data sets were processed using the R statistical programming environment. Missing data points were assigned ‘undetermined’, indicating sequence abundances below the detection limit of the OpenArray platform. Quantile normalization was applied to data sets to adjust for technical variation and to make data points comparable among each other. Features or targets with greater than 10 undetermined values were removed from the analysis. An additional filtering step was performed to remove features showing little or no variation across samples since these targets with relatively constant Ct levels are less likely to be differentially expressed. This was achieved removing features with an interquartile range of less than 2. A Mann–Whitney test was performed to compare the samples from patients with elevated and normal ICP. Profiling hundreds of genes at the same time represents a large multiple hypothesis-testing problem from the statistical perspective. While typically this is adjusted by computing false discovery rates (FDR), in this case, however, due to the low number of samples, the multiple testing correction was not applied (since none of the targets showed less than 15% FDR).     Methods were performed in accordance with relevant regulations and guidelines. The study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards at Johnson Space Center and Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), Houston, TX. Subject recruitment was done at BCM and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.\n\nThe study population was a pool of neurological patients with suspected IIH, requiring diagnostic or therapeutic LP. Subjects were recruited on the basis of the modified Dandy criteria for IIH and the IIH treatment trial, 17 consisting in the presence of signs and symptoms of raised ICP (higher than 20 cm H2O  equals to14.7 mmHg), absence of localized findings except those from increased ICP, or abnormal neuroimaging except for empty sella turcica and distended optic nerve sheath. The subject was awake and alert, and no other cause of increased ICP was present. For the LP, the subjects lay in the lateral decubitus position with legs slightly extended. Once the needle was in the thecal sac at the L3-L4 or L4-L5 region, the manometer was observed for the presence of pulse and respiratory waves to indicate patent communication between needle and subarachnoid space. Next, the opening pressure was monitored over a period of 5 min, ICP was measured every minute, and the average calculated. CSF was then drained as per the normal clinical procedure. A volume of 5 ml was collected specifically for the purpose of this study.\n\nOf 22 subjects recruited, ICP was not able to be determined in one of them due to technically difficult LP. That subject was therefore not included in the study and data collection was completed in 21 subjects. The cut off between normal and elevated ICP was established at 18 mm Hg. Patients were grouped into 'normal to moderately high ICP' subjects (less than 18 mmHg) and high ICP (higher than 18 mmHg). Seven 'normal to mild ICP' and 14 high ICP subjects were compared in the study.\n\nAdditionally, subjects had 10 ml blood drawn for plasma separation in K2EDTA BD Vacutainer® blood collection tubes with gel barrier. All plasma and CSF samples were pre-filtered through a 0.8-µm syringe filter prior to microvesicular processing, aliquoted and stored at −80 °C in a freezer at the Center for Space Medicine at BCM and then shipped to the Exosome Diagnostics facilities in Cambridge, MA.     Reverse transcription (RT) of miRNA was performed using the Megaplex™ RT Primers (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) to prepare cDNA for real-time PCR analysis on a TaqMan® MicroRNA Array, including a pre-amplification step. Collectively, the Human Pool Set v3.0 containing two Megaplex™ RT Primer Pools, Pools A v2.1 and B v3.0 cover 754 unique microRNAs. The RT reaction for each primer pool was set as follows: 1× Megaplex RT Primers (Pool A or B), 2 mM dNTPs (with dTTP), 10 U/μL MultiScribe reverse transcriptase, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1× RT buffer, 0.25 U/ μL RNAse inhibitor, in a final volume of 15 μL per reaction. The reaction was run through the temperature sequence per the manufacturer’s instructions. Preamplification was performed in a 50 μL reaction with a 10 μL aliquot of the RT reaction as a template, 1× TaqMan® PreAmp Master Mix and 1× Megaplex™ PreAmp Primers (Pool A or Pool B), in a temperature cycling (16 cycles) according to the manufacturer. Pre-amplified samples were diluted 1:10 in 0.1× TE pH 8.0. The TaqMan® OpenArray® Human MicroRNA Panel was used for final PCR detection.     In this final step, the DNA polymerase of the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix amplifies the specific cDNA targets using sequence-specific primers and probe on the TaqMan microRNA Array. 25 µL TaqMan OpenArray Real-Time PCR Master Mix and 13 µL 0.1× buffer TE pH 8.0 were loaded into each of two adjacent wells per sample on a clean 96-well plate. For each sample, 12 µL of diluted Pool A PreAmp was pipetted into one well of each pair and 12 µL of diluted Pool B PreAmp was pipetted into the other well for a total volume of 50 µL in each well. For each sample and primer pool set (Pool A or Pool B), 5 µL of each reaction mixture was pipetted into each of eight wells on an OpenArray 384-well sample plate. Samples were loaded onto OpenArray plates using the standard Accufill protocol. Amplification was performed according to the protocol established for the TaqMan® OpenArray Human MicroRNA panel.",

          "Study Description": "The visual impairment and intracranial pressure (VIIP) syndrome is a neuro-ophthalmologic condition described in astronauts returning from long duration space missions. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is characterized by a chronic elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) in the absence of an intracranial mass lesion. Because VIIP and IIH share some neurologic and ophthalmologic manifestations, the latter might be used as a model to study some of the processes underlying VIIP. This work constitutes a preliminary investigation of the molecular pathways associated with the elevation of ICP in IIH. Gene expression signatures were obtained from exosomes collected from CSF and plasma in patients with possible signs of IIH. The gene expression targets focused on inflammatory genes and miRNAs. The results suggest that inflammatory cytokine-driven processes and immune cell migration are activated when ICP is elevated in IIH patients, either as a cause or effect of the ICP increase. Several miRNAs appear to be involved in this response, among which miR-9 and miR-16 are upregulated in CSF and plasma of higher ICP subjects. This study provides evidence in support of neurophysiological alterations and neuro-immunomodulation in this condition. If similar changes are seen in astronauts manifesting with the VIIP syndrome, an underlying pathophysiological basis may be discovered.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "The total duration of the study, including familiarization sessions, was 11 weeks. We employed a within-subjects design whereby one leg was randomized to perform unilateral leg extension and leg press exercise 3 d·wk-1 for 10 weeks. The contralateral leg had a knee brace applied during the last two weeks of the study, and otherwise remained untrained. Body composition and maximal strength assessments were performed before training (Pre-RT; day 0), before immobilization (Pre-UL; day 56), and upon completion of training and immobilization (Post-RT/UL; day 70). At each testing session, participants had their lean body mass (LBM), mid-thigh vastus lateralis cross sectional area (VLCSA), and ISO-MVC assessed. VLCSA, muscle volume, and whole-quadriceps CSA was quantified using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at time points Pre-RT and Post-RT. A total of 7 muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis throughout and used, in conjunction with deuterium oxide, to measure integrated rates of muscle protein synthesis.\nUnilateral Resistance Exercise - HypAt: Participants visited the laboratory every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to complete unilateral leg extension and leg press exercise. Each session was supervised by a strength and conditioning coach and consisted of 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions of leg extensions and 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions on a 45-degree leg press. The last set of each exercise was performed to volitional failure, defined as an inability to complete a repetition through the full range of motion. If the participant successfully completed more than 12 or less than 8 repetitions, weight was adjusted accordingly. Following each exercise bout, participants ingested 25 g of whey protein isolate to maximize the protein synthesis response to each exercise bout. Immobilization: A X-ACT ROM knee brace (DonJoy, Dallas, TX, USA) was applied to the contralateral non-training leg for a continuous period of 14 d during weeks 9 and 10. The angle of the brace was adjusted to permit toe clearance during crutch-assisted ambulation without active hamstring flexion and averaged ∼60° flexion.     Muscle biopsy samples (∼100 – 150 mg each) were obtained on 7 occasions under local anesthesia using a Bergstrom needle modified for manual suction. Biopsies were taken from the RT limb pre-RT (day 0), day 53, day 56 and day 70 and from the UL limb on day 53, 56, and 70. Blood and other non-muscle tissue were dissected from each specimen at bedside prior to being snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen (within ∼20 s) and stored at −80°C.     Approximately 20 mg of muscle was used to extract RNA. Muscle samples and 1000 μL of TRIzol were added to Lysing Matrix D tubes containing ceramic microbeads (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA) and homogenized using a FastPrep tissue homogenizer (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA). 200 μL of chloroform was added and the tubes hand-shaken vigorously for 15 s and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Samples were then centrifuged at 12 000 g for 10 min at 4°C and the upper aqueous phase containing RNA was transferred to an RNase-free tube. RNA was purified using E.Z.N.A Total RNA Isolation kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, USA).     The RNA was processed to single-stranded sense fragmented DNA using the GeneChip® WT PLUS Reagent Kit which relies on a reverse transcription priming strategy that primes both poly-A and non-poly-A RNA     5 μg of fragmented, end–labelled sense strand target cDNA was hybridized to each array and scanned using a Gene Chip Scanner 30007G     standard protocol",

          "Study Description": "The annotation of the Affymetrix HTA 2.0 array was updated to optimise the detection of RNA in human skeletal muscle biopsy samples by removing invalid and low signal-high-variance probes (as for CDF GPL24047). The probes were then summarized into groups (probe-sets) reflecting either an ensembl full transcript identifier (FL-ENST, GPL24047) or just the probes targeting the 3' UTR or the 5' UTR of that particular ENST. Therefore, 3 different CDF were used to process the HTA 2.0 arrays in this study. Note that each CEL file was GC adjusted using APT while our custom CDF pipeline removes any probe that has >80% or <20% GC content (~50,000). The analysis was carried out only on the pairs of probe-sets i.e. FL-ENST vs 3'UTR or FL-ENST vs 5'UTR or 3'UTR vs 5'UTR. Dynamic muscle loading alters tissue phenotype reflecting altered metabolic and functional demands. In humans, heterogeneous adaptation to loading complicates identification of the underpinning molecular regulators. We present a within-person analysis strategy that reduced heterogeneity for changes in muscle mass by ~40% and employed a genome-wide transcriptome method that modeled each mRNA from coding exons and 3’/5’ untranslated (UTR) regions. Our strategy detected ~3-4 times more regulated genes than similarly sized studies, including substantial UTR-selective regulation that other methods would not detect. We discovered a core of 141 genes correlated to muscle growth validated from newly analyzed independent samples (n=100). Further validating these identified genes, via RNAi in primary muscle cells, we demonstrate that members of the core genes were regulators of protein synthesis e.g. Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity in Humans MoTrPAC. Employing proteome-constrained networks and pathway analysis revealed notable relationships with the molecular characteristics of human muscle aging and insulin sensitivity, as well as potential drug-therapies.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Total RNA was isolated from the HUVEC using Trizol method (Invitrogen, USA). Three independent experiments in G and MG conditions were performed using the HUVEC. Next, all thee isolated RNA samples were pooled for the Deep Sequencing. About 0.8 ml Trizol was added to 0.2 ml cell suspension, and mixed by pipetting. Further, 0.2 ml chloroform added, mixed by inverting the tube and incubated for 2–3 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and the aqueous layer was transferred to a fresh tube. RNA was precipitated by adding 0.5 ml isopropanol and incubated for 10 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C for pelleting the RNA. After washing the pellet with 75% ethanol and air drying, eluted in 50 µl RNase free water. The quantity and quality of the isolated RNA were checked using Qubit™ RNA BR Assay Kit and RNA screen Tape.     Small RNA library was prepared using NEB Next Multiplex small RNA Library prep kit in which 3′ adapters (5′-AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCT-3′) and 5′ adapters (5′-GTTCAGAGTTCTACAGTCCGACGATC-3′) ligated to the total RNA, followed by reverse transcription reaction.

The quality of the library was checked using TapeStation (Agilent Technologies) to confirm the average library size.     The final library product was sequenced with 2 ×100 bp paired end cycles to obtain 20–30 million reads per sample using Illumina HiSeq2500 platform (Illumina Inc., USA). The next generation sequencing procedures were performed at AgriGenome Labs, Cochin, India.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Homo sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.4/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Homo sapiens STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCh38 (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.107.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Homo sapiens STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) to generate the RSEM_Unnormalized_Counts_GLbulkRNAseq.csv table. Due to low sample size, these data were not processed through differential gene expression analysis.     Human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were purchased (Lonza, India) and cultured in endothelial growth medium-2 (EGM-2, Lonza, India) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 1% EC growth supplement, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2.     Totally, 20,000 cells/ml were used for all MG conditions unless otherwise stated. After adhesion of the cell monolayer or alternatively suspension cells were prepared by trypsinization, the cells were exposed to MG conditions (0.003 g) for 2 h. Cell culture plates or 1.5 ml of Eppendorf centrifuge tubes were completely filled with media to avoid fluid shear stress All the experiments were performed in triplicate (n  3).\n\nThe 3D clinostat is an effective, ground-based tool to stimulate MG (0.003 g) conditions14. It is a 3D equipment which equalizes the earth G. It consists of an inner and outer frame with dimensions of 30 × 30 × 30 (cm), controlled by two different motors (constructed based on the design of clinostat used by the Fokker Space, Netherlands). The inner frame contains sample holders at its center. Samples were kept exactly in the center of Clinostat. The motion of clinostat can be bidirectional to avoid dynamic stimulation. Rotation of inner and outer chamber well was controlled by computerized interface software. Rotation of cells with horizontal axis results in the randomization of the gravitational vector, three-dimensional spatial freedom and low-fluid shear stress. The entire system was placed in an incubator maintaining a temperature of 37 °C. All the experiments were performed in triplicates unless mentioned otherwise.",

          "Study Description": "Adaptation of humans in low gravity conditions is a matter of utmost importance when efforts are on to a gigantic leap in human space expeditions for tourism and formation of space colonies. In this connection, cardiovascular adaptation in low gravity is a critical component of human space exploration. Deep high-throughput sequencing approach allowed us to analyze the miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), cultured under gravity (G), and stimulated microgravity (MG) achieved with a clinostat. The present study identified totally 1870 miRNAs differentially expressed in HUVEC under MG condition when compared to the cells subjected to unitary G conditions. The functional association of identified miRNAs targeting specific mRNAs revealed that miRNAs, hsa-mir-496, hsa-mir-151a, hsa-miR-296-3p, hsa-mir-148a, hsa-miR-365b-5p, hsa-miR-3687, hsa-mir-454, hsa-miR-155-5p, and hsa-miR-145-5p differentially regulated the genes involved in cell adhesion, angiogenesis, cell cycle, JAK-STAT signaling, MAPK signaling, nitric oxide signaling, VEGF signaling, and wound healing pathways. Further, the q-PCR based experimental studies of upregulated and downregulated miRNA and mRNAs demonstrate that the above reported miRNAs influence the cell proliferation and vascular functions of the HUVEC in MG conditions effectively. Consensus on the interactome results indicates restricted fluctuations in the transcriptome of the HUVEC exposed to short-term MG that could lead to higher levels of endothelial functions like angiogenesis and vascular patterning.",

To gain insight into the role of miRNAs and lncRNAs in response to radiation and microgravity, we analyzed RNA expression profiles in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells incubated for 24 h in static condition or in rotating condition to stimulate microgravity in space after 2 Gy γ-ray irradiation. Expression of 14 lncRNAs and 17 mRNAs was found to be significantly down-regulated in the simulated microgravity condition. In contrast, irradiation up-regulated the expression of 55 lncRNAs and 56 mRNAs, while only one lncRNA, but no mRNA, was down-regulated. Furthermore, 2 miRNAs, 70 lncRNAs, and 87 mRNAs showed significantly altered expression under simulated microgravity after irradiation, and these changes were independently induced by irradiation and simulated microgravity. Together, our results indicate that simulated microgravity and irradiation additively and independently alter the expression of RNAs and their target genes in human lymphoblastoid cells.",

Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).     Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on Affymetrix HuGene-2_1-st array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.     Affymetrix protocol     The probe-set level intensities of the arrays were normalized using the Robust Multi-array Analysis method (RMA) implemented within Affymetrix Expression Console version 1.4.1.     Following the questionnaires and medical and physiological screening tests, 14 healthy male subjects entered the study and completed the first two experimental campaigns; two subjects dropped out of the study between the second and third campaign for personal reasons, and one subject discontinued his participation prematurely in campaign 3, due to an intestinal problem.

The participants were subjected to a standardized diet that was strictly applied throughout each campaign. During bed rest conditions, the participants were strictly restricted to a horizontal position avoiding any strenuous physical activity. These restrictions implicated all daily routines (e.g. showering/toilet) though a change of position from lateral to supine or prone was allowed as well as passive stretching by a physiotherapist.\n\nThe circadian rhythm of all subjects was regulated by a standardized wake/sleep cycle (wake-up 7:00 am; lights off 11:00 pm). In the facility, environmental conditions were controlled and maintained at the same level through all campaigns (ambient temperature: 24.4 ± 0.7 °C; relative humidity: 53.5 ± 5.4%; ambient pressure: 684 ± 4 mmHg).

          "Study Protocol Description": "Triplicate cell pellets, previously held at -80 C, were processed using the All Prep DNA/RNA kit (Qiagen #80204) according to the manufacturer's instructions.     Cy3, Cy5     Bisulphite converted DNA was amplified, fragmented and hybridized to Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 Beadchip using standard Illumina protocol     BeadStudio software v3.2     A linear mixed efects model, CpGassoc, was used to perform quality control and to identify DNA methylation changes signifcantly associated with dose, or with time afer exposure.     The immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line (HBEC3- KT) was established by introducing mouse Cdk4 and hTERT into normal human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and were a kind gift from Dr. J.D. Minna of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Throughout this study the HBEC3-KT immortalized line was cultured in Serum-Free Keratinocyte Medium (K-SFM) supplemented with human recombinant Epithelial Growth Factor and Bovine Pituitary Extract (Life Technologies #17005-042). Triplicate biological replicates were irradiated and maintained independently. Cells were continually grown in a 5% CO2 environment at 37 C and passaged (1:4) twice per week for three months. Cell pellets (1x10^6) were collected at each passage, flash frozen, and stored at -80 C for subsequent DNA extraction.     High-energy HZE particle irradiations were performed in Brookhaven, NY at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL). The X ray (low-LET) exposures were conducted at Emory University using an X-RAD 320 biological irradiator (Precision X-Ray, North Branford, CT).  Cells were shipped to BNL via overnight courier in T-75 culture flasks filled to capacity with growth media. Upon receipt, media levels were adjusted, and cells were allowed to recover for at least 24hrs. One day prior to irradiation, cells were trypsinized, counted, and seeded into T25 fasks allowing for biological triplicate flasks for each experimental condition including an unirradiated control. Three biological replicate cultures containing either 1x10^6 cells (for acute time point) or 2x10^5 cells (for continuous culture) in T-25 flasks were irradiated independently with 0, 0.1, 0.3 or 1.0 Gy 56Fe ions (Beam energy: 600 MeV/u; dose rate for the 0.1 Gy dose was 0.1 Gy/min, for the 0.3 Gy dose, 0.3 Gy/min, and for the 1.0 Gy dose, 1 Gy/min.) or with 0.0, 0.3, 1.0 Gy 28Si ions (Beam energy: 300 MeV/u; dose rate for the 0.3 Gy dose was 0.28 Gy/min, and for the 1.0 Gy dose, 0.63 Gy/min). Culture flasks were positioned orthogonally to the beam using an automated flipper provided at the NSRL. For each experiment, mock-irradiated controls (triplicate cultures) were seeded at the same time as the experimental flasks, from the same parent culture and handled identically (including travel to/from the NRSL facility), but were not placed in the beam line. Immediately following irradiation, all cultures were returned to a 37 C incubator for forty-eight hours before cell pellets were collected from one set of flasks (triplicates, 2 day time point), while the remaining cultures were returned to the home laboratory at Emory University and maintained in continuous culture for an additional 3 months, with biweekly subculturing and DNA collection. X ray irradiations were performed using identical plating conditions but were exposed to doses of 0 Gy and 1.0 Gy (beam energy 320 kV; dose rate ~1 Gy/min) at Emory University. Cultures were maintained independently from the start of the experiment.     Cell pellets (1x10^6) were collected at each passage, flash frozen, and stored at -80 C for subsequent DNA extraction.",

          "Study Description": "Human deep space and planetary travel is limited by uncertainties regarding the health risks associated with exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), and in particular the high linear energy transfer (LET), heavy ion component. Here we assessed the impact of two high-LET ions 56Fe and 28Si, and low-LET X rays on genome-wide methylation patterns in human bronchial epithelial cells. We found that all three radiation types induced rapid and stable changes in DNA methylation but at distinct subsets of CpG sites affecting different chromatin compartments. The 56Fe ions induced mostly hypermethylation, and primarily affected sites in open chromatin regions including enhancers, promoters and edges ('shores') of CpG islands. The 28Si ion-exposure had mixed effects, inducing both hyper and hypomethylation and affecting sites in more repressed heterochromatic environments, whereas X rays induced mostly hypomethylation, primarily at sites in gene bodies and intergenic regions. Significantly, the methylation status of 56Fe ion irradiation sensitive sites, but not those affected by X ray or 28Si ions, could discriminate tumor from normal tissue for human lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. Thus, high LET radiation exposure leaves a lasting imprint on the epigenome, and affects sites relevant to human lung cancer. The 56Fe ion signature may prove useful in monitoring the cumulative biological impact and associated cancer risks encountered by astronauts in deep space. Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal human bronchial epithelial cells irradiated with varying doses of 28Si-ion radiation ( 300 MeV/u at 0, 0.3, 1.0 Gy) , 56Fe-ion radiation (600 MeV/u at 0, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 Gy) or X rays (320 kV at 0, 1.0 Gy). Triplicate control and irradiated samples were incubated and sampled at 4 timepoints between 2 and 62 days. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across >485,000 CpGs from collected samples. Samples include: 56Fe ions, 4 doses x 4 time points x 3 replicates (4 removed in QC) = 44 samples; 28Si ions = 3 doses x 4 time points x 3 replicates = 36 samples; X ray, 2 doses x 4 time points x 3 replicates (2 removed in QC)= 22 samples. Overall design: Bisulphite converted DNA from the 102 samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip.",

Blood samples were then subsequently stored at 37 C in an Engel MHD13F-DM portable incubator (Engel USA, Jupiter, FL). Whole blood samples were radiated at the Kentucky Lion Eye Center using a Gammacell 1000 Elite (Cs-137) (Best Theratronics Ltd., Ottawa, Canada) for 0 seconds (control, 0.0 Gy exposure), 1.5 seconds (0.15 Gy exposure), 3 seconds (0.30 Gy exposure), or 16 seconds (1.5 Gy exposure). Vacutainer tubes containing whole blood were incubated at 37 C for either 1 hr, 2 hr, or 6 hr after being radiated.     At the end of the incubation period, blood samples were transferred to 50ml conical tubes containing 30ml of NH4Cl red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer (1:15 v/v dilution), pre-warmed at 37 C in order to isolate leukocytes. The tubes were agitated 5 minutes on a rocker platform and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1500 RPM at room temperature. Cells were suspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged again twice for 5 minutes at 1500 RPM. White blood cells (WBC) were suspended in 2 ml PBS, equivalent to the initial volume of the whole blood. WBC were centrifuged 5 min at 1500 RPM. Supernatant was discarded and cell pellets were suspended in 600 ul RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) and tubes were vortexed vigorously and stored at -70 C until RNA purification.     Purification of total RNA was performed using the RNAeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Optional on-column DNase digestion was performed to eliminate genomic DNA contamination. Total RNA was eluted in 50 ml of RNase-free water. The quantity analysis of the total RNA was performed with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE). The quality of the total RNA was checked using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc, Santa Clara, CA).     Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard protocol for Affymetrix 3' IVT Express Reagent Kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA) from 100 ng total RNA.     Following fragmentation, 10 mg of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45 C to Affymetrix GeneChip PrimeView Human arrays (GEO platform GPL15207) according to the GeneChip 30 array Hybridization User Manual from Affymetrix. The arrays were washed and stained in an Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.     GeneChips were scanned using GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix) and the GeneChip Command Console software version 4.0 (Affymetrix).",

          "Study Description": "One of the most likely risks astronauts on long duration space missions face is exposure to ionizing radiation associated with highly energetic and charged heavy (HZE) particles. Since access to medical expertise on such a mission is limited at best, early diagnosis and mitigation of such exposure is critical. In order to accurately determine the time since exposure and dosage of exposure, dose- and time-dependent biomarkers are needed. Therefore, we performed a dose- and time-course transcriptional analysis for radiation exposure at 0, 0.15, 0.30, and 1.5 Gy with corresponding time points at 1 hour (hr)post-exposure as well as 2 hr and 6 hr using Affymetrix Human PrimeArray chips. The analysis of our data suggests a set of sensitive genetic biomarkers specific to each radiation level as well as generic radiation response biomarkers. Upregulated biomarkers can then be used within lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems to detect exposure to ionizing radiation. Overall design: A total of 100 human samples representing radiation exposure at levels 0 Gy, 0.15 Gy, 0.30 Gy and 1.5 Gy at time points 1 hour (hr), 2 hr, and 6 hr post-exposure were constructed. Blood samples were extracted from ten human volunteers, and were irradiated. Leukocytes were extracted, and gene expression was measured. Samples for all ten volunteers were measured at 1 hr and 2 hr for all four dose levels, while samples from volunteers 1,2,3,4, and 7 were measured at 6 hr, resulting in 10 replicates at 1 hr and 2 hr for each dosage, and 5 replicates at 6 hr post-exposure. Thus, a total of 25 samples at each of the four radiation levels were sampled, yielding the total of 100 samples.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "The Rotary Cell Culture System-1 (RCCS-1) bioreactor (Syn-thecon, Houston, TX, USA), developed by NASA, was used to perform experiments in simulated uG conditions. The RCCS-1 rotates one vessel at a constant speed with an adjustable rotation speed. To adapt the single station rotator base to perform multiple experiments using conventional T25 culture ﬂasks, a series of 3D-printed adaptors were created. Models were designed using Tinkercad web based platform and fabricated with 3D printer MakerBot Replicator 2x (Makerbot Industries, Brooklyn, NY, USA) using white and blue acrylonitrile butadiene styrene at 300 um layer resolution. The whole assembly has a diameter of 13 cm and can accommodate four T25 ﬂasks simultaneously, with a distanceof the bottom of each ﬂask to the center of 5 cm. Simulated uG experiments were performed placing the RCCS-1 insidea cell incubator with controlled atmosphere (37C, 5% CO2), using a rotation speed set at 11 rpm.\n\nCaco-2 cells (HTB-37TM) were purchased from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) and cell culture reagents from Carlo Erba Reagents (Cornaredo,Milano, Italy). Caco-2 cells were routinely grown in T25 vented ﬂasks (Corning, NY, USA) with Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol L^−1 glutamine, 50 U uL^−1 penicillin, and 50 ug mL^−1 streptomycin. The medium was changed two times per week and cells were split before conﬂuency (about 80%) at 1:4 subcultivation ratio. Brieﬂy, the cell monolayer was washed with 0.1 mol L^−1 phosphate buffer saline (PBS), then cells were detached using 2 mL of 0.25% (w/v) trypsin-EDTA solution. Cells were then collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 2000 rpm, resuspended in 5 mL of fresh medium and inoculated into new ﬂasks at 2 × 10^4 viable cells/cm2. After splitting, cells were let to adhere for 48 h, then each T25 vented ﬂask was ﬁlled up with culture medium (about 75mL) and incubated for further 48 or 72 h at 37C, 5% CO2, either in stationary position (normal gravity, control cells) or into the modiﬁed rotary cell culture system set at 11 rpm (simulated uG cells). After incubation, cells were collected into 15 mL falcon tubes by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 min and cell pellets (3 × 10^6 cells/pellet) were immediately frozen and stored at -80C. Each experiment (at 48 h and 72 h incubation time, either normal gravity or uG) was performed in triplicate.     The 3 x 10^6 cells in each pelley were lysed by a previously described protocol, with some modiﬁcations; brieﬂy, the lysis buffer was prepared with 8 mol L^−1 urea in 100 mmol L^−1 Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and 0.1% (v/v) protease inhibitor cocktail. All the lysates were boiled to denature proteins for 5 min, sonicated for 30 min and ﬁnally vortex shaken for 30 min.The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay using BSA as standard.\n\nFor digestion, 1000 uG protein aliquots were diluted to 1 uG uL^−1 with 8 mol L^−1 urea in Tris-HCl buffer, then treated with 200 mmol L^−1 dithiothreitol (DTT) in Tris-HCl buffer and 200 mmol L^−1 iodoacetamide (IAA) in Tris-HCl. The samples were then diluted with 50 mmol L^−1 Tris-HCl to obtain a 1 mol L^−1 ﬁnal urea concentration. Sequencing grade-modiﬁed tryspin was added (1:20, enzyme: protein ratio) and the samples were incubated overnight at 37C. The enzymatic digestion was quenched by triﬂuoracetic acid (TFA). Digested samples were desalted using SPE C18 cartridges (Bond Elut 1CC LRC-C18, Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) conditioned with ACN and rinsed with 0.1% TFA. Peptides were eluted from the SPE column with 500 uLACN:H2O (50:50, v/v) containing 0.05% TFA, and were dried in a Speed-VacSC 250 Express (Thermo S 164 avant, Holbrook, NY, USA). Each sample was re-constituted with 500 uL 0.1% HCOOH and stored at −80C until analysis.     High-pH reversed phase liquid chromatography was per-formed using PLRP-S column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 um, Agilent Technologies Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled with PLRP-Sguard cartridge (5 x 3 mm, Agilent Technologies Santa Clara, CA, USA) and the detector was set at 214 nm. The sample was eluted at 1 mL min^−1 by 10 mmol L^−1 ammonium formate (pH 10) as mobile phase A and ACN/ammonium formate(90:10, v/v) as mobile phase B. The gradient started from 100% A, while B was increased to 40% in 40 min; ﬁnally, B was increased to 100% in 3 min and kept for 4 min. Finally, B was brought back to 0% within 2 min and the column re-equilibrated for 20 min.\n\nTwenty-four fractions were collected from minute 2 to 60 and pooled into 12 fractions. Fractions were lyophilized in a Speed-Vac and stored at−80C prior to MS analysis. The high-pH-RP fractionationprocess was repeated 13 times (three biological replicates for each of the four studied conditions and one time to test andoptimize the entire protocol).\\\n\nPeptide mixtures were separated by RP chromatography using the Dionex Ultimate 3000 (Dionex Corporation Sunnyvale, CA, USA) connected to an Orbitrap Elite hybrid ion trap-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Bremen, Germany) via a nanoelectrospray ion source. Peptide mixtures were enriched on a 300 um id x 5 mm Acclaim PepMap C18 (5 um particle size, 100 A pore size) u-precolumn (Dionex), employing a premixed mobile phase ddH2O:ACN 98:2 (v/v) (from loading pump) containing 0.1% (v/v) HCOOH at a ﬂow-rate of 10 uLmin−1. Then, peptide mixtures were separated by an EASY-Spray column (PepMap100 C18 2 um particle size, 100A pore size, 75 um x 50 cm). The LC gradient was optimized to detect the largest set of peptides, using ddH2O:HCOOH (99.9:0.1, v/v) as phase A and ACN:HCOOH (99.9:0.1, v/v) as phase B. After an isocratic step at 1% for 5 min, B was linearly increased to 5% within 2 min and then to 30% within 180 min; afterward, phase B was increased to 50% within 23 min, and increased to 80% within the following 5 min. Then, phase B was maintained at 80% for 20 min to rinse the column. Finally, B was lowered to 1% within 1 min and the column re-equilibrated for 44 min (280 min total run time). MS spectra were collected over an m/z range of 380–1400 Da using a resolution setting of 60 000 (FWHM, m/z 400), operating in the data dependent mode to automatically switch between Orbitrap-MS and LTQ-MS/MS acquisition. MS/MS spectra were collected for the twenty most abundant ions in each MS scan. Rejection of +1 and unassigned charge states was enabled. All MS/MS spectra were collected using a normalized collision energy of 30%, and an isolation window of 2 m/z. Iontrap and Orbitrap maximum ion injection times were set to 100 and 200 ms, respectively. Automatic gain control wasused to prevent overﬁlling of the ion traps and was set to 1 × 10^6 for full FTMS scan, and 1 × 10^4 ions in MS modefor the linear ion trap. To minimize redundant spectral acquisitions, dynamic exclusion was enabled with a repeat count of 1 and a repeat duration of 30 s with exclusion duration of 70 s.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Total RNA was isolated from mock-treated and irradiated cell pellets using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (217004, Qiagen), according to manufacturer's instructions.     Total RNA was amplified using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA amplification kit with biotin UTP (Enzo) labeling. The Illumina TotalPrep RNA amplification kit uses T7 oligo(dT) primer to generate single-stranded cDNA followed by a second strand synthesis to generate double-stranded cDNA which is then column purified. In vitro transcription was done to synthesize biotin-labeled cRNA using T7 RNA polymerase. The cRNA was then column purified and then checked for size and yield using the Bio-Rad Experion system. 1 ug of cRNA was hybridized for each array using standard Illumina protocols with streptavidin-Cy3 (Amersham) being used for detection.     Samples were processed and hybridized to Illumina Human HT12v4 arrays (Illumina, Inc.) using standard Illumina protocols.     The slides were scanned on an Illumina BeadStation (Illumina, Inc.; Genomics Core, UT Southwestern Medical Center).     The two-step normalization procedure and the Associative analysis functions are implemented in MatLab (Mathworks, MA) and available from authors upon request. These algorithms are also obtainable from an R package diffGeneAnalysis, available as a part of Bioconductor packages (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.5/bioc/html/diffGeneAnalysis.html).\n\nMethods for data normalization and analysis are based on the use of internal standards (Rocke and Durbin 2001) that characterize some aspects of the system's behavior, such as technical variability, as presented elsewhere (Dozmorov and Centola 2003; Dozmorov and Lefkovits 2009). The comparison of these methods with some other normalization and analysis procedures was presented in (Dozmorov, ea, 2010).     DNA lesions and replication stress were induced by exposing the cells to high-LET iron (Fe) particles generated at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory in Brookhaven National Laboratory, Long Island, NY. The energy of the used Fe-particles was 1 GeV/nucleon and the dose rate ranged from 50 to 200 cGy/min. The linear energy transfer (LET) of the Fe-particles was 150 keV/μm. The residual ranges of the beams were determined before each experiment and used to calculate the track-averaged LET values.     HT1080 cells were grown in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) alpha supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 U/ml penicillin.\n\nHT1080 cells were transfected with a mammalian expression plasmid containing tetracycline-inducible Rad51 shRNA and selected in presence of hygromycin (75 ug/ml). To down-regulate RAD51 protein levels, cells were cultured in the presence of doxycycline (DOX, 1ug/mL) for 72 h. After 72h, WT and sh RAD51 HT1080 cells were exposed to 1 Gy high-LET iron (Fe) particles generated at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory in Brookhaven National Laboratory, Long Island, NY. The energy of the used Fe-particles was 1 GeV/nucleon and the dose rate ranged from 50 to 200 cGy/min. The linear energy transfer (LET) of the Fe-particles was 150 keV/um. Cell pellets were collected from mock and irradiated cells at different time intervals (4h and 8h) and stored at -80C until use.",

We identified a novel role for RAD51 in innate immune response signaling. Defects in RAD51 lead to the accumulation of self-DNA in the cytoplasm, triggering a STING-mediated innate immune response after replication stress and DNA damage. Our data suggest that in addition to playing roles in homologous recombination-mediated DNA double-strand break repair and replication fork processing, RAD51 is also implicated in the suppression of innate immunity. Thus, our study reveals a previously uncharacterized role of RAD51 in initiating immune signaling, placing it at the hub of new interconnections between DNA replication, DNA repair, and immunity. Overall design Gene expression analysis of WT and sh RAD51 HT1080 cells was carried out before and after 1 Gy of high LET Fe particle radiation.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Cell lines were procured from the National centre for cell science, Pune, India and were maintained in DMEM-F12 (DLD-1) or RPMI1640 (MOLT-4) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, USA) at 37C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator in 25mm3 tissue culture plates (TCP) and in 10ml3 high aspect ratio vessels (HARV) within a rotating cell culture system (RCCS). The cell lines were introduced into the 10ml HARV through 5ml syringes and a rotating speed of 27 revolutions per minute (RPM) was standardized based on the aggregation of DLD-1 cells loaded at 0.5 x 10^6 cells within 24 to 48 hours. Cells were grown in HARV for a maximum of 72 hours with additional medium injected into the HARV every 16 to 24 hrs to prevent foaming or air bubbles. Contents of the HARV were transferred to 60mm TCP, without dissociating cell aggregates, for routine micrographic observation and other cell based assays by using 10ml pipettes. 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA was used for dissociation of cell aggregates and monolayer cultures when required.     Total RNA was extracted from cells using RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Germany). 2x10^6 cells were centrifuged and washed twice with PBS. RNA was isolated from these cells as per the manufacturer's instructions. 1.5 ug of total RNA was converted to cDNA using MMLV-RT (Thermo scientific, USA) and Oligo-dT primers (NEB, USA). miRNA conversion to cDNA was carried out using stem-loop reverse transcriptase (RT) primers without dithiothreitol (DTT) and the RNA denaturation step to maintain integrity of the stem-loop primer.     Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix)     Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip Human PrimeView Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.     GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner G2500A.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.4/Microarray/Affymetrix/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAffymetrix). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.4). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.3.3) using oligo (version 1.66.0). Raw data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.66.0). The raw probe level intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the oligo (version 1.66.0) quantile method. Normalized probe level data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.66.0). Normalized probe level data was summarized to the probeset level using the oligo (version 1.66.0) RMA method. Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probeset using biomaRt (version 2.58.2), Ensembl database (ensembl.org, release 107). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.3.3) using limma (version 3.58.1); all groups were compared pairwise for each probeset to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value.

          "Study Protocol Description": "IMR90 iPSCs were induced for cardiac differentiation using a growth factor-guided protocol. Cardiac spheres were generated from cells at differentiation day 4 and subjected to simulated microgravity using a random positioning machine (RPM) or standard gravity.     RNA samples from cells at differentiation day 8 were prepared using  Aurum total RNA mini kit (Bio-Rad).     Libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq RNA kit (Illumina Inc. San Diego, CA, USA) as per manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1000 ng of total RNA samples from 3 independently derived cardiac progenitors at day 8 were used for library preparation. The TruSeq method (LowThroughput protocol) employs two rounds of poly-A based mRNA enrichment using oligo-dT magnetic beads followed by mRNA fragmentation using cations at high temperature. First and second strand cDNA synthesis was performed followed by end repair of the blunt cDNA ends. One single 'A' base was added at the 3' end of the cDNA followed by ligation of barcoded adapter unique to each sample. The adapter-ligated libraries were then enriched using PCR amplification. The amplified library was validated using a High Sensitivity DNA chip on the Agilent Bioanalyzer. The libraries were further quantified on Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) using the High Sensitivity dsDNA assay. The libraries were normalized and 8 samples were multiplexed in each lane of the flowcell. PhiX was used as an internal control on each lane to monitor the error statistics. Cluster generation was performed on the V3 flowcell on the Illumina cBot.     Clustered flowcell was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 1000 in 101-base single-read reactions.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.4/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Homo sapiens STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCh38 (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.107.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Homo sapiens STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value.

Methods: RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq RNA kit and the TrueSeq method was employed for mRNA enrichment. The libraries were quantified and samples were multiplexed in each lane of the flowcell. Cluster generation was performed and then sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq1000 system. Reads were mapped on the Human Genome Reference and normalized expression table was generated. Results: Among differentially expressed genes, 53 of them were up-regulated and 75 were down-regulated. Conclusions: Data demonstrate increased expression of genes associated with growth, development, and pro-survival in cardiac progenitors cultured under simulated microgravity compared with those cultured under standard gravity. RNA-sequencing analysis was performed to compare global gene expression profiles of cells at differentiation day 8 under simulated microgravity vs. standard gravity.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Healthy men were recruited as test subjects. Inclusion and exclusion criteria have been detailed elsewhere (Debevec et al. 2014). In general, they adhered to those outlined for bedrest studies by the European Space Agency. In addition, individuals who had been exposed to altitudes above 2000 m within 2 months prior to the first experimental campaign were not considered for participation. Following the questionnaires and medical and physiological screening tests, 14 healthy male subjects entered the study and completed the first two experimental campaigns; two subjects dropped out of the study between the second and third campaign for personal reasons, and one subject discontinued his participation prematurely in campaign 3, due to an intestinal problem. Upon study enrollment, their mean ± SD age, body mass, height, and body mass index were 27 ± 6 years, 77 ± 12 kg, 179 ± 3 cm, and 23.7 ± 3.0 kg/m2.\n\nThe experiments and interventions were conducted at the Olympic Sport Centre Planica, located at an altitude of 940 m above sea level, in Ratece, Slovenia. Each subject participated in three experimental campaigns in a counterbalanced fashion: normoxic bedrest (NBR; fraction of oxygen in the ambient gas [FO2] equals 0.209; inspired partial pressure of oxygen [PIO2] equals 133 ± 0.3 mmHg), hypoxic bedrest (HBR), and hypoxic ambulatory confinement (HAMB), both hypoxic conditions with FO2 equals 0.141 ± 0.004 and PIO2 equals 90 ± 0.4 mmHg, equivalent to an altitude of ≈4000 m). Each intervention (bedrest or ambulatory confinement) lasted 21 days, and the interventions were separated by a 4‐month washout/recovery period. Several experiments (the majority of which will be reported elsewhere) were performed during the 21‐day intervention periods (D1 to D21), and in particular during the 7 days preceding (baseline days termed: D‐7 to D‐1), and 4 days following each intervention.\n\nDuring the intervention periods, all subjects were confined to a specific floor of the Olympic Centre, with two subjects in each room. They adhered to strict routines as regards daily activities and dietary intake, as described in detail elsewhere (Debevec et al. 2014). Briefly, energy requirements were estimated on an individual basis using the modified Harris–Benedict resting metabolic rate equation (Hasson et al. 2011). The diet provided a daily protein intake of greater than1 g protein/kg body mass, and a sodium intake of less than 3 g/day. Average daily energy intake was 2197 ± 193 kcal in the HAMB condition and 2027 ± 188 and 2018 ± 202 kcal in the NBR and HBR conditions, respectively (Debevec et al. 2014).\n\nOne part of the floor was maintained hypoxic by means of a vacuum pressure swing‐adsorption system (b‐Cat, Tiel, The Netherlands).\n\nThroughout both bedrest interventions, each subject remained in a horizontal position at all times. He was allowed one pillow for the head and to occasionally lean on an elbow while eating or being transferred to a gurney. Muscular exercise (e.g., static contractions using the foot board) was prohibited. To ensure that all subjects complied with the requirements of the bedrest protocol, they were continuously surveilled by use of video cameras. During the HAMB confinement, each subject was allowed to move freely within the hypoxic area. To mimic a normal level of physical activity, subjects performed 30 min of low‐intensity exercise twice daily.     Muscle samples were obtained in the morning after a night's fasting (greater than or equal to10 h) on days D‐6 and D21; the baseline biopsy (D‐6) was taken in a normoxic environment (air), whereas the D21 biopsies were taken in the prevailing ambient gas environment. The subject was transferred to the laboratory in a supine position and a muscle sample was obtained from the superficial mid‐portion of the vastus lateralis of the nondominant leg. The site was anesthetized by injecting 2–4 mL of 2% lidocaine hydrochloride. Following the application of the anesthetic, a 1–2 cm incision was made to the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle fascia, and the muscle sample was removed using a Rongeur biopsy forceps. The sample was weighed, sectioned, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were kept at −80°C until further processing.     Biopsy amounts sufficient for RNA isolation was available in 72 samples obtained from 13 of the 14 subjects.\n\nTotal RNA from 15 mg muscle tissue was prepared by the Trizol method (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and quantified spectrophotometrically by absorbance at 260 nm and Agilent Tapestration RNA screen Tape (Santa Clara, CA).     In vitro transcription (IVT) was performed using the Bioarray high yield RNA transcript labelling kit (P/N 900182; Affymetrix, Inc., High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, UK). Unincorporated nucleotides from the IVT reaction were removed using the RNeasy column (QIAGEN Inc, Venlo, Netherlands).     Hybridization, washing, staining, and scanning of the arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix, Inc.) at the Bioinformatics and Expression Analysis service facility at Karolinska Institutet.     Affymetrix protocol     Quality control, normalization, and annotation of probe sets were carried out on Affymetrix Expression Console version 1.4.1. Two samples failed quality control based on low signal on several spike‐in probes. Further means to control the quality of the individual arrays included examination using hierarchical clustering and plotting of log expression signal and probe cell intensity. Finally, all samples were inspected using principal components analysis (PCA) on log2 expression signals.\n\nThe probe set‐level intensities of the arrays were normalized using the robust multi‐array analysis method (RMA) and “Detection above Background algorithm” (DABG) was conducted on Affymetrix Expression Console version 1.4.1.",

Briefly, 1ml of RNA-STAT solution was added per 10^6 cells and homogenized for 5 minutes over ice. 1ml of chloroform was added, contents shaken vigorously and centrifuged at 12,000g at 4C for 15 minutes. The aqueous solution was transferred to corex tube (Corning Inc., Lowell, MA) and 0.8 ml isopropanol added. After incubation of 10 minutes, the contents were centrifuged at 12,000g for another 10 minutes to precipitate the RNA. The RNA pellet was washed with 75% ethanol and centrifuged at 7,500g for 5 minutes at 4C. The ethanol was aspirated and the RNA pellet dried. The RNA pellet was finally resuspended in DEPC water and submitted to the Purdue Genomic Center for conversion into cDNA, sonication, adapter ligation and sequencing.

Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Homo sapiens STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 98, genome version GRCh38 (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.toplevel.fa), and the following gtf annotation file: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.98.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Homo sapiens STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value.

          "Study Protocol Description": "Whole blood was drawn from four (4) volunteers using a Safety Winged IV blood draw set (Exel International, St. Petersburg, FL) in 7-ml lavender topped Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) anticoagulant-containing vacutainers. Blood samples were aliquoted and kept at room temperature throughout the radiation and white blood cell (WBC) isolation process.     Whole blood samples were radiated at the Kentucky Lion Eye Center using a Gammacell 1000 Elite (Cs-137) (Best Theratronics Ltd., Ottawa, Canada) for 0 seconds (control - 0.0 Gy exposure), 3 seconds (0.30 Gy exposure), 16 seconds (1.5 Gy exposure), or 32 seconds (3.0 Gy exposure). Cesium-137 produces gamma rays with an energy of 0.662 MeV and has a half-life of 30.1 years. Ionizing radiation energy values were added by GeneLab.     Approximately 30 minutes after completion of the radiation cycle, red blood cells (RBC) were lysed by adding 15ml of NH4Cl red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer for each ml of whole blood (1:15 v/v dilution) in order to isolate leukocytes. The tubes were agitated 5 minutes on a rocker platform and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1,500 RPM at room temperature. Cells were suspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged again twice for 5 minutes at 1,500 RPM. White blood cells (WBC) were suspended in 2 ml PBS, equivalent to the initial volume of the whole blood. WBC were centrifuged 5 min at 1,500 RPM. Supernatant was discarded and cell pellets were suspended in 600 ul RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) and tubes were vortexed vigorously and stored at -70C until RNA purification. Purification of total RNA was performed using the RNAeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Optional on-column DNase digestion was performed to eliminate genomic DNA contamination. Total RNA was eluted in 60 ul of RNase-free water. The quantity analysis of the total RNA was performed with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE). The quality of the total RNA was checked using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc, Santa Clara, CA).     Biotinylated cDNA were prepared according to the standard protocol for Affymetrix GeneChip WT Expression protocol (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA) (Ambion WT Expression kit followed by GeneChip WT Terminal Labeling and Hybridization kit) from 100 ng total RNA.     Following fragmentation, cDNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45oC to Affymetrix Human gene 1.0 ST v1 arrays according to the GeneChip WT Terminal Labeling and Hybridization User Manual from Affymetrix.     GeneChips were scanned using GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix) and the GeneChip Command Console software version 3.1 (Affymetrix).     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.5 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.5/Microarray/Affymetrix/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAffymetrix). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.4). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using oligo (version 1.58.0). Raw data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). The raw probe level intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the oligo (version 1.58.0) quantile method. Normalized probe level data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). Normalized probe level data was summarized to the probeset level using the oligo (version 1.58.0) RMA method. Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probeset using biomaRt (version 2.50.0), Ensembl database (ensembl.org, release 107). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probeset to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned for every probeset that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Description": "One of the most likely risks astronauts on long duration space missions face is exposure to ionizing radiation associated with highly energetic and charged heavy (HZE) particles. Since access to medical expertise on such a mission is limited at best, early diagnosis and mitigation of such exposure is critical. In order to accurately determine the dosage within 1 hour post-exposure, dose-dependent biomarkers are needed. Therefore, we performed a dose-course transcriptional analysis for radiation exposure at 0, 0.3, 1.5, and 3.0 Gy with corresponding time point at 1 hour (hr) post-exposure using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST v1 Array chips. The analysis of our data suggests a set of sensitive genetic biomarkers specific to each radiation level as well as generic radiation response biomarkers. Upregulated biomarkers can then be used within lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems to detect exposure to ionizing radiation. A total of sixteen human samples representing radiation exposure at levels 0 Gy, 0.3 Gy, 1.5 Gy and 3.0 Gy at time point 1 hour (hr) post-exposure were constructed. Blood samples were extracted from four human volunteers, and were irradiated. Leukocytes were extracted, and gene expression was measured. Samples for all four volunteers were measured at 1 hr for all four dose levels, resulting in four replicates at each dose level. Thus, a total of 4 samples at each of the four radiation levels were sampled, yielding the total of 16 samples.",

In the present study, a bioreactor system using extremely low-frequency EMF and SMG was applied during the chondrogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). It was hypothesized that a beneficial effect of EMF regarding chondrogenesis (COL2A) could be combined with an avoiding effect of SMG regarding hypertrophy (COLXA1) of cartilage. Pellet cultures of hMSCs formed cartilaginous tissue under the addition of growth factors (FGF; TGF-beta3). Pure SMG reduced COLXA1 expression but also COL2A expression of hMSCs. Pure EMF showed no gene expression changes of hMSCs during chondrogenic differentiation. Combining EMF/SMG resulted in a re-increase of COL2A but did not reach control levels. The COL2A to COLXA1 ratio of combined EMF/SMG was not significantly different from control levels.

          "Study Description": "Interplanetary human spaceflight represents a formidable medical challenge, but also provides a unique platform for investigating human adaptation to extreme environmental changes. Understanding the long-term effects of isolation has relevance in a range of scenarios and it is well recognized that a better understanding of the relationship between environmental exposure and the epigenome can lead to more effective preventive measures. Here we conduct a longitudinal epigenetic, mood state and biochemical profiling of 6 crew members in an experiment simulating a 520-day mission to Mars. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles. Firstly, we found that long-term isolation can induce global DNA methylation remodeling, and this change seems to be an active adaptation (rather than a random process or a by-product of the isolation). This study is the first to demonstrate the dynamic relationship between global epigenetic remodeling and isolation-induced mood state and biochemical changes. Secondly, by considering the location of methylation sites within the genome and using gene-pathway annotation, we were able to identify pathways that were significantly enriched in methylation events and consider their association with specific function and the timeline of the mission. Thirdly, via our definition of epi-entropy, a measure of entropy adapted to methylation events, we observed that the methylation remodeling produced a marked reduction in epi-entropy. Results suggest that DNA methylation change is an indicator of change rather than its by-product, i.e., there is a psychology-epigenome-metabolism model of long-term depression; DNA methylation programs the environment signal into the epigenome, which is subsequently transformed into the biochemical output and health outcome. Thus, longitudinal epigenetic profiling could code the effect of isolation and act as early indicators of latent health outcome. A longitudinal epigenetic, mood state and biochemical profiling of 6 crew members in an experiment simulating a 520-day mission to Mars. 36 samples of blood cell DNA methylation profiling were obtained by Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, across 6 sampling points during the 520 days mission for all of the 6 crew members.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells, H1299 (ATCC, CRL-5803), were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS plus penicillin/streptomycin (50 μg/ml) at 37C in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator. H1299 cells were infected with pSUPER.retro.puro viral vector containing a RAD9 shRNA to promote knockdown of expression as described, and grown in medium supplemented with puromycin (2 ug/ml) for selection of stable clones. RAD9 protein levels in cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-RAD9 antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories, catalog no. 611324) and anti-beta-actin antibody (Sigma, catalog no. A5316). Clones with greater than 70% reduction in RAD9 level, relative to parental control cells, were chosen for additional analyses.     Bystander studies were performed using a specialized two-ring system. The outer stainless steel ring has a base made of Mylar that is 6 μm thick, and the inner ring contains several strips of 30 μm Mylar as a base. The outer and inner rings fit together. After sterilizing in 70% ethanol and air-drying, both Mylar layers were coated with fibronectin solution. ES cells (2.5 × 10^5) were plated onto the double Mylar culture rings. Two days later, cells were essentially 100% confluent, allowing direct cell-cell communication. Confluent ES cells were irradiated with 3He α particles (LET 120–125 keV/μm) or served as unirradiated controls. Dishes were irradiated from underneath using the track segment mode of a 4 MeV Van de Graaff accelerator located at the Radiological Research Accelerator Facility of Columbia University. Since α particles can penetrate the 6-μm but not the 30-μm Mylar, only cells growing on the lower, thinner surface were irradiated. However, the unirradiated cells on the 30-μm strips were in physical proximity to the irradiated cells and were the “bystander” population. After irradiation, the medium was immediately changed to remove dead floating cells, and the dishes were incubated for 24 h. Irradiated and unirradiated cells were removed from the 6-μm and 30-μm Mylar strips separately using trypsin. Part of the trypsinized culture was replated onto a two-well chamber slide coated with fibronectin for detecting micronuclei. Some of the culture was replated onto a 100-mm tissue culture dish coated with 0.1% gelatin for cell survival assays. Cells were also seeded onto a six-well plate to monitor apoptosis.\n\nIrradiation of cells and detection of micronuclei were performed as above, H1299 and H1299shRAD9 cells (1 × 10^6) were plated onto concentric Mylar dishes a day before irradiation to ensure confluence at the time of treatment. Immediately prior to irradiation, cell culture medium was replaced with fresh medium to remove dead cells. Irradiations were carried out as described above, using a dose of 1 Gy alpha-particles. For each set of experiments, three to five dishes served as unirradiated controls. After irradiation, cells were incubated at 37C for 4 hours. Cells from directly irradiated (6 um Mylar) and corresponding bystander (34 um Mylar) dishes were processed for scoring micronuclei (MN) and for RNA isolation. In brief, dishes were separated, and cells were removed from a small area (about 4 mm^2) of each Mylar surface separately using trypsin. Cells from the rest of the Mylar were resuspended in lysis solution (miRCURY RNA isolation kit from Exiqon) and stored at −80C. Trypsinized cells were plated onto four-well chamber slides, and incubated for an additional 17 hours. Growth medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 2 μg/ml cytochalasin B, and cells were incubated for another 26 hours to enrich for those that are binucleated. Cells were fixed for 15 minutes with methanol: acetic acid (3:1), followed by two washes with distilled water. After air drying, slides were briefly stained with SYBR® Green solution (Molecular Probes), cells were visualized with a fluorescence microscope, and a minimum of 1000 binucleated cells were scored per sample. MN percentage was calculated as the number of binucleate cells with micronuclei relative to the total number of binucleate cells in the population examined.     RNA was isolated using Exiqon Mircury (Exiqon), according to the manufacturer’s instructions     Cyanine-3 (Cy3) labeled cRNA was prepared from 200 ng RNA using the One-Color Low RNA Input Linear Amplification PLUS kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer’s instructions     1.6 mg of cRNA (greater than 9 pmol Cy3 per mg cRNA) was fragmented and hybridized to Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays (G4845A) using the Gene Expression Hybridization Kit as recommended by Agilent     Slides were scanned immediately using the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2505B) and default parameters of Feature Extraction Software 11.5 (Agilent)     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7112 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Agilent_1-channel/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7112_Versions/GL-DPPD-7112.md), using NF_MAAgilent1ch version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAgilent1ch_1.0.4/Microarray/Agilent_1-channel/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAgilent1ch). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.1). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3). Raw data quality assurance density, pseudo image, MA, and foreground-background plots were generated using limma (version 3.50.3), and boxplots were generated using ggplot2 (version 3.4.0). The raw intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the limma (version 3.50.3) quantile method. Normalized data quality assurance density, pseudo image, and MA plots were generated using limma (version 3.50.3), and boxplots were generated using ggplot2 (version 3.4.0). Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probe using biomaRt (version 2.50.0), Ensembl database (ensembl.org, release 107). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probe to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Description": "Background: The radiation bystander response is an important component of the overall response of cells to radiation and critical to understanding health risks of radiation exposure to humans. The mechanism of radiation response includes inter-cellular signaling and intra-cellular communication by which the bystander signal is propagated. Methods: We measured the bystander response to 1Gy a-particle radiation in Mrad9-/- mouse stem cells and H1299shRAD9 cells, using chromosomal aberration and micronucleus formation as DNA damage endpoints. In the H1299 model we used whole genome microarray analyses to profile the transcriptome of irradiated and bystander cells. Results: We investigated the role of RAD9 in the bystander response and showed that depletion or mutation of RAD9 had an effect of increasing chromosomal structural damage as well as micronucleus formation in bystander cells. The enhancement of the damage effect correlated strongly with a transcriptomic response in critical pathways. RAD9 depletion affected many pathways in the cell, including the UV-MAPK pathway, involving p38MAPK members, STAT1 and PARP1 at the mRNA levels. There was an overall reduction of RNA biogenesis of gene members of this pathway suggesting that perhaps these signaling pathways do not function optimally after RAD9 depletion. Using network analysis we found there may be differential activation of transcriptional regulators between the irradiated and bystander cells involving the SP1 and NUPR1 transcription factors. Network analysis also suggested that HIF1a (Hypoxia induced factor 1a) activation could be a negative predictor of the bystander effect and perhaps that local hypoxic stress observed by cells that are directly exposed to radiation may predict whether or not they will elicit a bystander response. Gene expression in H1299 cells was measured at 4 hours after exposure to 1 Gy a-particles. There were two groups based on RAD9 status, RAD9 normal and RAD9 depleted by siRNA. In each of these groups, sham irradiated, direct irradiated cells for positive bystanders, positive bystanders, direct irradiated cells for negative bystanders and negative bystanders; were identified based on micronucleus responses. Five biological replicates were analyzed for each experimental group.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were obtained from freshly collected 'buffy coats' from blood samples of twelve healthy anonymous donors at the Blood Centre of the City Hospital of Padova (Italy). This study obtained the Ethics Approval from the Transfusion Medicine (TM) Ethics Committee of Blood Centre of the City Hospital of Padova. PBLs were isolated by separation on Biocoll density gradient (BIOCHROM, Berlin, Germany). After isolation, PBLs were preincubated overnight at a concentration of 3 x 10^6 cells/mL in basal medium RPMI 1640 containing GlutaMAX I (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 124_U/mL penicillin, 63 g/mL streptomycin sulfate, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, BIOCHROM, Berlin, Germany). After the overnight incubation, PBLs, consisting of peripheral mononuclear cells depleted of monocytes, were suspended at 1 x 10^6 cells/mL in basal medium and subjected to modeled microgravity, simulated by the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor (Synthecon, Cellon), placed inside a humidified incubator, vertically rotating at 23_rpm. In the rotating system, the gravity is balanced by equal and opposite mechanical forces (centrifugal, Coriolis, and shear components), and the gravitational vector is reduced to about 10^-3 g. In these conditions, single cells are nearly always in suspension, rotating in quasi-stationary manner with the fluid, in a low-shear culture environment. Ground-based (1 g) PBLs were kept at the same cell density in 75 cm^2Êflasks (FALCON) in the same medium. After 24, 48, or 72 h of incubation in MMG and 1g PBLs were activated to enter cell cycle to measure cell proliferation by incubation in culture medium (CM) containing phytohaemagglutinin (PHA, BIOCHROM, Berlin, Germany) and interleukin 2 (IL2, Chiron Siena, Italy) as stimulating factors [46].     Total RNA was isolated from 107 cells by using TrizolÂ® Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Total RNA was quantified using the ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop), while RNA integrity and content of microRNAs (%) in each samples were assessed by capillary electrophoresis using the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip and the Small RNA Nano LabChip respectively using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies). Only total RNA samples with R.I.N. (RNA Integrity Number) values of 6, or higher, and the percentage of miRNA < 20% were used for microarray analysis.     We performed miRNA expression profiling from 200 ng of total RNA and following the miRNA Microarray System protocol v. 1.5 (Agilent Technologies). Total RNA was dephosphorylated and ligated with pCp-Cy3. Unincorporated dyes were removed with MicroBioSpin6 columns (BioRad) . Labeled RNA was hybridized to Agilent miRNA arrays for 22 hours at 55C using the Agilent's Hybridization Oven that is suited for bubble-mixing and microarray hybridization processes.

Our results show that 42 miRNAs were differentially expressed in MMG-incubated PBLs compared with 1g-incubated ones. Among these, miR-9-5p, miR-9-3p, miR-155-5p, miR-150-3p, and miR-378-3p were the most dysregulated. To improve the detection of functional miRNA-mRNA pairs we performed gene expression profiles on the same samples assayed for miRNA profiling and we integrated miRNA and mRNA expression data. The functional classification of miRNA-correlated genes evidenced significant enrichments in the biological processes of immune/inflammatory response, signal transduction, regulation of response to stress, regulation of programmed cell death and regulation of cell proliferation. We identified the correlation between miR-9-3p, miR-155-5p, miR-150-3p and miR-378-3p expression with that of genes involved in immune/inflammatory response (eg. IFNG and IL17F), apoptosis (eg.

By comparing the expression profile of MMG-incubated vs. 1g-incubated PBLs of the same donor, we found 42 differentially expressed miRNAs, 25 up-regulated and 17 down-regulated.",

Only total RNA samples with R.I.N. (RNA Integrity Number) values of 6, or higher, were used for microarray analysis.     Eight hundred nanograms of total RNA were labelled with Agilent One-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression protocol (Agilent) according to the manufacturer instructions. The synthesized cDNA was transcribed into cRNA and labelled with cyanine 3-labelled nucleotide. Labelled cRNA was purified with RNeasy Mini columns (Qiagen). The quality of each cRNA sample was verified by total yield and specificity calculated with NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer measurement (NanoDrop Technologies).     Samples were hybridized to Whole Human Genome Microarray 4 x 44K (G4112F, Agilent Technologies). 1.65 ug of Cy3 labelled aRNA were hybridized for 17 hours at 65ºC in a hybridization oven (G2545A, Agilent) set to 10 rpm in a final concentration of 1X GEx Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM, according to manufacturer's instructions (One-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis, Agilent Technologies). Arrays were washed with Agilent Gene Expression wash buffers and Stabilization and Drying Solution as suggest by the supplier.

Only spots with signal minus background flagged as positive and significant (flag equals 1) were used in the following analysis as detected spot while probes with flag equal to 0 were noted as null. Probes with less than 90% of detected spots across all arrays were removed from the analysis. Background corrected intensities of replicated spots on each array were averaged. Data were inter-array normalized with Quantile normalization (Bolstad BM et al., Bioinformatics (2003), 19(2):185-93) and then log2-transformed. Principal component analysis, cluster analysis and profile similarity searching were performed with tMev that is part of the TM4 Microarray Software Suite (Saeed AI, Bhagabati NK, Braisted JC, Liang W, Sharov V, Howe EA, et al. Methods in Enzymology. 2006;411:134-93). Identification of differentially expressed genes was performed with one and two class Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) program (Tusher VG, Tibshirani R, Chu G. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2001;98:5116-121) with default settings. SAM uses a permutation-based multiple testing algorithm and identifies significant genes with variable false-discovery rates (FDR).

          "Study Protocol Description": "In accordance with our institutional review board approved protocol, gross identification of a normal prostate tissue sample (1 cm^3) was obtained from consented patients undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Sections of adjacent tissue used for culture were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) and evaluated by a clinical pathologist to confirm normal tissue histology. Briefly, minced samples were collagenase digested, plated in RPMI-1640 plus 10% fetal bovine serum and maintained in a humidified 37C incubator with 5% CO2.     Cells were irradiated acutely using a Cesium-137 (Cs-137) Mark I irradiator with a dose-rate of 0.48 Gy per min. In parallel with acute exposures, chronic low dose-rate exposure used a sealed flat uniform sheet of Cobalt-57 (Eckert and Ziegler Isotope Products, Valencia, CA, USA). Samples were in a dedicated incubator directly above the Cobalt-57 source while control and acutely irradiated samples were placed in an incubator with identical conditions without an irradiation source. To measure the Cobalt-57 chronic dose-rate, four independent measurements with Luxel OSL dosimeters (Landauer, Glenwood, IL, USA) were used for two different exposure times of 7,000 min (n equals 2) or 1,500 min (n equals 2). The results indicated the decay corrected dose-rate at the start of the first experiment was 17.0 +/- 0.8 μGy per min (2.45 +/- 0.12 cGy per day). Decay corrected dose-rates were then calculated for each individual experiment. Cobalt-57 produces photons at three energies: 0.122 MeV (86%), 0.136 MeV (11%), 0.014 MeV (9%). Cesium-137 produces gamma rays with an energy of 0.662 MeV and has a half-life of 30.1 years. Ionizing radiation energy values were added by GeneLab.     Acute samples were harvested after the indicated time point from the time of irradiation. Chronically irradiated samples were harvested immediately after the indicated time point and had received constant low dose-rate irradiation during that time.     Total RNA was extracted after treatment using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA quality and quantity was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.     Biotinylated cRNA was prepared with the Ambion MessageAmp kit for Illumina arrays. Briefly, 500 ng of total RNA was amplified using the TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) and 750 ng of the product was loaded onto the gene array chips.     Standard Illumina hybridization protocol at 55C.     Following hybridization at 55C, the chips were scanned using the Illumina iScan (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). HumanHT-12v4 expression bead chips with more than 47,000 probes covering RefSeq and UniGene annotated genes were used (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). A total of four independent experimental replicates were used for each sample resulting in (2 individuals x 4 experimental conditions x 4 experimental replicates) 32 microarrays.",

          "Study Description": "Despite concerns over risks from exposure to low-dose ionizing radiations encountered in the environment and workplace, the molecular consequences of these exposures, particularly at representative doses and dose-rates, remains poorly understood. Using a novel flood source construct, we performed a direct comparison of genome-wide gene expression regulations resulting from exposure of primary human prostate fibroblast cultures to acute (10 cGy and 200 cGy) and longer-term chronic (1.0-2.45 cGy cumulative over 24 h) exposures. Expression profiling showed significant differential regulation of 396 genes with no measureable changes in the acute 10 cGy dose. However, there were 106 genes in common between samples given an acute 200 cGy dose compared to those given chronic doses, most of which were decreased and related to cell cycle or chromosomal movement in M-phase. Biological pathway analysis showed decreases in cell cycle, chromosomal movement, cell survival and DNA replication, recombination and repair as well as a predicted activation of transcriptional regulators TP53, RB1 and CDKN2A. In agreement with these results, prostate epithelial cells given 200 cGy or chronic doses displayed functional decreases in proliferation and mitotic cells. In summary, we showed a contrast to the common observation of constant or reduced effect per unit dose as the dose (acute) was diminished, that even very low total doses delivered chronically could rival the perturbing effect of acute doses 100 times as intense. Underscored is the importance of the means of dose delivery, shown to be as important as dose size when considering biologic effect.",

The protocol includes differential lysis of red and white blood cells, and an on-column DNase digestion. Globin message was further reduced using GLOBINclear (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) to specifically remove both alpha- and beta- globin. RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer and quality was monitored with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     Cyanine-3 (Cy3) labeled cRNA was prepared from 500 ng RNA using the One-Color QuickAmp kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, followed by RNAeasy column purification (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). Dye incorporation and cRNA yield were checked with the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer.          1.5 ug of Cy3-labelled cRNA (specific activity >10.0 pmol Cy3/ug cRNA) was fragmented at 60°C  for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 250 ml containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturers instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 250 ml of 2x Agilent hybridization buffer was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays (G4112A) for 17 hours at 65°C  in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C  GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately by brief centrifugation.     Slides were scanned immediately after washing on the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2505B) using one color scan setting for 1x44k array slides (Scan Area 61x21.6 mm, Scan resolution 10μm, Dye channel is set to Green and Green PMT is set to 100%).     The scanned images were analyzed with Feature Extraction Software 9.1 (Agilent) using default parameters (protocol GE1-v1_91 and Grid: 012391_D_20060331) to obtain background subtracted and spatially detrended Processed Signal intensities.

For each experiment, irradiated and non-irradiated PBL of the same donor were incubated in 1 g and MMG conditions for 4 and 24 h. MMG was simulated by the Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) bioreactor (Synthecon, Cellon).     Total RNA was isolated from 107 cells by using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was quantified using the ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop), while RNA integrity and content of microRNAs (%) in each samples were assessed by capillary electrophoresis using the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip and the Small RNA Nano LabChip respectively using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies). Only total RNA samples with R.I.N. (RNA Integrity Number) values of 6, or higher, and the percentage of miRNA < 20% were used for microarray analysis.     We performed miRNA expression profiling from 200 ng of total RNA and following the miRNA Microarray System protocol v. 1.5 (Agilent Technologies). Total RNA was dephosphorylated and ligated with pCp-Cy3. Unincorporated dyes were removed with MicroBioSpin6 columns (BioRad) . Labeled RNA was hybridized to Agilent miRNA arrays for 22 hours at 55°C using the Agilent's Hybridization Oven that is suited for bubble-mixing and microarray hybridization processes.

          "Study Description": "BACKGROUND: Ionizing radiation (IR) can be extremely harmful for human cells since an improper DNA-damage response (DDR) to IR can contribute to carcinogenesis initiation. Perturbations in DDR pathway can originate from alteration in the functionality of the microRNA-mediated gene regulation, being microRNAs (miRNAs) small noncoding RNA that act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. In this study we gained insight into the role of miRNAs in the regulation of DDR to IR under microgravity, a condition of weightlessness experienced by astronauts during space missions, which could have a synergistic action on cells, increasing the risk of radiation exposure. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed miRNA expression profile of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) incubated for 4 and 24 h in normal gravity (1 g) and in modeled microgravity (MMG) during the repair time after irradiation with 0.2 and 2Gy of gamma-rays. Our results show that MMG alters miRNA expression signature of irradiated PBL by decreasing the number of radio-responsive miRNAs. Moreover, let-7i*, miR-7, miR-7-1*, miR-27a, miR-144, miR-200a, miR-598, miR-650 are deregulated by the combined action of radiation and MMG. Integrated analyses of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles, carried out on PBL of the same donors, identified significant miRNA-mRNA anti-correlations of DDR pathway. Gene Ontology analysis reports that the biological category of Response to DNA damage is enriched when PBL are incubated in 1 g but not in MMG. Moreover, some anti-correlated genes of p53-pathway show a different expression level between 1 g and MMG. Functional validation assays using luciferase reporter constructs confirmed miRNA-mRNA interactions derived from target prediction analyses. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: On the whole, by integrating the transcriptome and microRNome, we provide evidence that modeled microgravity can affects the DNA-damage response to IR in human PBL.",

Eight hundred nanograms of total RNA were labelled with Agilent One-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression protocol (Agilent) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The synthesized cDNA was transcribed into cRNA and labelled with cyanine 3-labelled nucleotide. Labelled cRNA was purified with RNeasy Mini columns (Qiagen). The quality of each cRNA sample was verified by total yield and specificity calculated with NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer measurement (NanoDrop Technologies     Samples were hybridized to Whole Human Genome Microarray 4 x 44K (G4112F, Agilent Technologies). 1.65 ug of Cy3 labelled aRNA were hybridized for 17 hours at 65°C in a hybridization oven (G2545A, Agilent) set to 10 rpm in a final concentration of 1X GEx Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM, according to manufacturer's instructions (One-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis, Agilent Technologies).

Data were inter-array normalized with Quantile normalization (Bolstad BM et al., Bioinformatics (2003), 19(2):185-93) and then log2-transformed. Principal component analysis, cluster analysis and profile similarity searching were performed with tMev that is part of the TM4 Microarray Software Suite (Saeed AI, Bhagabati NK, Braisted JC, Liang W, Sharov V, Howe EA, et al. Methods in Enzymology. 2006;411:134-93). Identification of differentially expressed genes was performed with one and two class Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) program (Tusher VG, Tibshirani R, Chu G. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2001;98:5116-121) with default settings. SAM uses a permutation-based multiple testing algorithm and identifies significant genes with variable false-discovery rates (FDR). This can be manually adjusted to include a reasonable number of candidate genes with acceptable and well defined error probabilities.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7112 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Agilent_1-channel/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7112_Versions/GL-DPPD-7112.md), using NF_MAAgilent1ch version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAgilent1ch_1.0.4/Microarray/Agilent_1-channel/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAgilent1ch).

Thus, identification and characterization of bystander mechanisms will help to development of new treatments of patients with a radiation exposure. In the present study, we irradiated 3-dimensional tissue model of human epidermis, Epi-200 (Mat-Tek, Ashland, MA), with 2.5 Gy protons. By exposing only a thin strip across the center of the EPI-200 tissue, we have been able to measure global gene expression responses in directly irradiated and bystander cells located at 0.125-0.375, 0.375-0.625, 0.625-875 mm from the irradiation line. The data were analyzed using BRB-Array Tools (NIH), and further gene ontology analysis and network analysis was performed with Panther (Applied Biosystems) and IPA (Ingenuity), accordingly. Significantly responding genes were identified at all distances and included sets common to both direct and bystander responses. False discovery rate in bystander samples did not exceed 20% (p equals 0.001) and was sufficiently low in the samples obtained after the whole tissue exposure (0.06-1.16%). Analysis of the fragments cut at the same distance revealed 52, 54 and 88 differentially expressed genes. These gene lists overlapped each other had from 3 to 12 genes in common including CLED2, S100A7A. Samples obtained after the whole tissue exposure discovered 949 differentially expressed genes. Moreover, the performed gene ontology analysis showed there overrepresentation of TP53 pathway (pathways, p equals 2.04E-02), a common marker of direct irradiation response, and also overrepresentation of the following groups of genes: signal transduction (p equals 4.52E-04), cell communication (p equals 1.24E-04) and cell cycle in the category of biological processes; DNA helicase activity (p equals 2.54E-07), receptor binding (p equals 6.19E-04), calcium ion binding proteins (p equals 2.57E-03) as the molecular functions. Differentially expresses genes of bystander samples had few categories in common such as cell communication (p equals 2.36E-03) and signal transduction (p equals 2.42E-03) among the biological processes and receptor activity (p equals 4.54E-03) among the molecular functions. Categories specific for the bystander samples included G-protein coupled receptors (p equals 7.24E-03) and ligand-gated ion channels (p equals 4.16E-03) suggesting a role of external stimulation and ion trafficking in bystander mechanisms. Radiation induced gene expression in 3-dimensional tissue model, Epi-200, was measured in 16 hours after exposure to 2.5 Gy of protons. Four independent experiments were performed for the samples collected at different distances from the irradiation line (125-375, 375-625 and 625-875 micrometers) using three tissue fragments per a data point. Moreover, three sets of whole tissue irradited samples were also generated for 0 and 2.5 Gy (6 samples total) and used for comparison of bystander and direct responses.",

          "Study Description": "Ionizing radiation (IR) not only affects cells that are directly irradiated but also their non-irradiated neighbors, which show responses known as bystander effects. While bystander and direct responses have several common end points including apoptosis and micronucleation, chromatin remodeling and altered levels or activities of regulatory proteins, they can be quantitatively and qualitatively different. The majority of studies of radiation bystander effects have utilized 2-dimensional in vitro systems, but we have recently demonstrated such effects in EPI-200 (Mat-Tek, Ashland, MA), a 3-dimensional tissue model that precisely imitates the structure and function of human epidermis. Global gene expression is a powerful tool for uncovering both fundamental signaling processes and the mechanistic basis of cellular or physiological effects. By exposing only a thin strip across the center of the EPI-200 tissue, we have been able to measure global gene expression responses in bystander cells located at 0.125 and 0.625 um from the irradiation line, in 16h after irradiation. The data were analyzed using BRB-Array Tools (NIH), and further network analysis was performed with IPA (Ingenuity). Significantly responding genes were identified at the both distances. For instance, all sets demonstrated upregulation of two key enzymes of the lipid biosynthesis, UGT1 and PITPNB, and downregulation of proapoptotic proteins: BAX and ARHGEF5. In contrast, several proteins involved in transcriptional repression (CHD6, CHD8 andWRNIP1) were strongly upregulated suggesting a rearrangement in the gene transcription. These changes suggest an activation of bystander mechanisms different from those observed in 2-dimensional cell cultures. Radiation induced gene expression in 3-dimensional tissue model, Epi-200, was measured in 16 hours after exposure to 0.5 Gy of alpha-particles. Three independent experiments were performed for the samples collected at different distances from the irradiation line (125-625 and 625-1125 um) using three tissue fragments per a data point.",

          "Study Description": "Direct irradiation of 3-dimensional skin model, Epi-200, with alpha-particles led to differential regulation of 545 genes at 4 h postirradiation. Unlike the traditional 2-dimensional in vitro systems, Epi-200 made of the primary cells, epidermal human keratinocytes. It mimics the structure of the human epidermis Global gene expression is a powerful tool for uncovering both fundamental signaling processes and the mechanistic basis of cellular or physiological effects. By comparing irradiated tissues with non-irradiated control, we have been able to measure global gene expression responses and reveal the affected biological pathways and molecular functions. The data were analyzed using BRB-Array Tools (NIH), and further gene ontology analysis was performed with Panther (Applied Biosystems). The responding pathways were identified jointly and separately for up- and downregulated genes. Receptors (12 genes, p=0.0467), including nuclear hormone receptors (3 genes, p=8.2 x E-04) and Ser/Thr receptors (3 genes, p=5.3 x E-03), chemokines (2 genes, p=0.0155) and signaling molecules were overrepresented among 123 upregulated genes while DNA binding proteins (27 genes, p=5.07 x E-04), particularly helicases (6 genes, p=3.61 x E-03) and, G-protein modulators (16 genes, p=4.4 x E-03) were overrepresented among 403 downregulated genes. Remarkably, 6 differentially regulated genes in this group were represented by helicases and methyltransferases (6 genes, p=0. 0534) involved in methylation of histones and DNA. These changes confirmed an importance in the biological response of two its basic components: receptor-regulated pathways and chromatin remodeling. Upregulation the first group supposes to increase sensitivity of irradiated cells to chemokines and cytokines while downregulation of the second group would likely affect the DNA methylation pattern and stimulate the transcription. Radiation induced gene expression in 3-dimensional tissue model, Epi-200, was measured at 4 hours after exposure to 0.5 Gy of alpha-particles. Three independent experiments were performed using one tissue sample per a data point.",

On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 250 ul of 2x Agilent hybridization buffer was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays (G4112A) for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately by brief centrifugation.     Slides were scanned immediately after washing on the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2505B) using one color scan setting for 4x44k array slides (Scan setting with eXtended dynamic range, Scan area 61x21.6 mm, Scan resolution 5um, Dye channel is set to Green and Green PMT is set to XDR Hi 100% and XDR Lo 10%).     The scanned images were analyzed with Feature Extraction Software 9.1.3.1 (Agilent) using default parameters (protocol GE1-v1_91_1 and Grid: 014850_D_20070207) to obtain background subtracted and spatially detrended green Processed Signal intensities.  Features flagged in Feature Extraction as Feature Non-uniform outliers or Features not Positive and significant were excluded.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7112 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Agilent_1-channel/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7112_Versions/GL-DPPD-7112.md), using NF_MAAgilent1ch version 1.0.3 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAgilent1ch_1.0.3/Microarray/Agilent_1-channel/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAgilent1ch). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.1). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3). Raw data quality assurance density, pseudo image, MA, and foreground-background plots were generated using limma (version 3.50.3), and boxplots were generated using ggplot2 (version 3.4.0). The raw intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the limma (version 3.50.3) quantile method. Normalized data quality assurance density, pseudo image, and MA plots were generated using limma (version 3.50.3), and boxplots were generated using ggplot2 (version 3.4.0). Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probe using the Ensembl database ftp server (ensembl.org, release 107). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probe to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Description": "Direct irradiation of 3-dimensional skin model, Epi-200, with alpha-particles led to differential regulation of 166 genes: 16 and 150 genes were differentially expressed at 1 and 16 h postirradiation. Unlike the traditional 2-dimensional in vitro systems, Epi-200 made of the primary cells, epidermal human keratinocytes. It mimics the structure of the human epidermis Global gene expression is a powerful tool for uncovering both fundamental signaling processes and the mechanistic basis of cellular or physiological effects. By comparing irradiated tissues with non-irradiated control, we have been able to measure global gene expression responses and reveal the affected biological pathways and molecular functions. The data were analyzed using BRB-Array Tools (NIH), and further gene ontology analysis was performed with Panther database (Applied Biosystems). Gene ontology analysis of the samples harvested in 16h after exposure showed that irradiation presumably affected the genes involved in cell-cell signaling (15 genes, , p=9.0 x E-04) ion transport (10 genes, p=0.00189) and amino acid metabolism (5 genes, p=0.0258). Among 16 genes differentially expressed in 1h after exposure we found NOTCH2 (ENST00000401649) and methyltransferase AOF1 (KDM1B). In the mammalian cells, NOTCH signaling pathway has a role in differentiation and intracellular communication. Moreover the intercellular domain of NOTCH regulates gene expression acting as a transcription factor. In turn, AOF1 affects the transcription via histone demethylation. Thus, irradiation with alpha-particles caused predominant downregulation of multiple genes in 1 and 16h after exposure. It also suggested that changes in cell metabolism initially affected transcriptional regulation and finally led to the rearrangement in expression of genes playing a role in biosynthesis and ion trafficking. Radiation induced gene expression in 3-dimensional tissue model, Epi-200, was measured in 1 and 16 h hours after exposure to 0.5 Gy of alpha-particles. Three independent experiments were performed using one tissue sample per a data point.",

RNA yield and quality were assessed with the NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Foster City, CA).     RNA (100 ng of each sample) was labeled and amplified with the one-color Quick Amp Labeling Kit. Briefly, the procedure included reverse transcription and synthesis of cRNA covalently labeled with Cy3.

          "Study Description": "Mitochondrial DNA-depleted human skin fibroblasts (HSF rho0) with suppressed oxidative phosphorylation were characterized by significant changes in the expression of 2100 nuclear genes, encoding numerous protein classes, in NF-kappaB and STAT3 signaling pathways and by decreased activity of the mitochondrial death pathway, compared to the parent rho+ HSF. In contrast, the extrinsic TRAIL/TRAIL-Receptor-mediated death pathway remained highly active, and exogenous TRAIL induced higher levels of apoptosis in rho0 cells compared to rho+ HSF. Global gene expression analysis using microarray and quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that expression levels of many growth factors and their adaptor proteins (FGF13, HGF, IGFBP4, IGFBP6, IGFL2), cytokines (IL6, IL17B, IL18, IL19, IL28B) and cytokine receptors (IL1R1, IL21R, IL31RA) were substantially decreased after mitochondrial depletion. Some of these genes were targets of NF-kappaB and STAT3, and their protein products could regulate the STAT3 signaling pathway. Alpha-irradiation induced expression of several NF-kappaB/STAT3 target genes, including IL1A, IL1B, IL6, PTGS2/COX2 and MMP12, in rho+ HSF, but this response was substantially decreased in rho0 HSF. Suppression of the IKK-NF-kappaB pathway by the small molecular inhibitor BMS-345541 and of the JAK2-STAT3 pathway by AG490 dramatically increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis in the control and irradiated rho+ HSF. Inhibitory antibodies against IL6, the main activator of JAK2-STAT3 pathway, added into the cell media, also increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis in rho+ HSF. However, NF-kappaB activation was partially lost in mitochondrial DNA-depleted HSF resulting in downregulation of the basal or radiation-induced expression of numerous NF-kappaB targets, further suppressing IL6-JAK2-STAT3, that in concert with NF-kappaB, regulated protection against TRAIL-induced apoptosis. There are 12 total samples, 3 biological replicates each of HSF rho+ and rho0 cells that were not irradiated (control=C) or irradiated (alpha=A). Cells were harvested at 4 hours after treatment.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "TK6 cells were maintained in exponential growth at densities of 1-10 x 10^5 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated (56C for 45 minutes) fetal calf serum and 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere in a 37C incubator.     HZE particle irradiation was performed at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Exponentially growing cells were concentrated by centrifugation and exposed to graded doses of 1 GeV/amu 56Fe ions (150 keV/um) in a volume of 10 ml per culture point to limit the amount of medium activated during the irradiation. Dosimetry was performed by the NSRL Physics Group. Tubes containing the cells were placed perpendicular to the beam in the center of the field, where the variation in fluence was  less than 5%. Control cultures were prepared in the same way and mock irradiated. An activated-medium control was prepared by irradiating 10 ml of medium without cells to the highest dose used (2.5 Gy). Immediately after irradiation, medium was added to bring the cells to normal culture densities (4-5 x 10^5cells/ml). Gamma-ray irradiation was performed at Columbia University using an AECL Gammacell-40 137Cs irradiator with a dose rate of 1.1 Gy/min.     RNA was extracted using a modified guanidine thiocyanate method, (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987, PMID: 2440339) followed by purification with RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA samples were quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and monitored for quality using an Agilent Bioanalyzer prior to labeling for microarray analysis.     24 hours after treatment, fluorescently labeled cDNA was prepared from mock-irradiated control and irradiated whole-cell RNA by a single round of reverse transcription (BRL Superscript II) in the presence of aminoallyl dUTP (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by coupling to monofunctional NHS-ester Cy3 or Cy5 dye (Amersham) (Amundson and Fornace, 2004. PMID:14970650)     Hybridization was carried out with active mixing using the MAUI Hybridization System (BioMicro Systems, Salt Lake City, UT) for 16 hours in Deposition Hybridization Buffer (Agilent) at 65oC in the presence of the blockers human CoT1, yeast tRNA and poly dA. Hybridized slides were washed at room temperature once in 0.5X SSC, 0.01% SDS for 5 minutes and again in 0.06X SSC for 5 minutes.     Slides were scanned on an Agilent Microarray Scanner, 100% PMT voltage, 10 uM resolution scans. Images were processed using ArraySuite 2.1 extensions in the IPLab program (Scanalytics Inc., Fairfax, VA) as described in Chen et al., 2002 (PMID: 12217912).     ID_REF equals VALUE equals Mean red and green background subtracted intensities for each feature were adjusted using the ratio used by the ArraySuite program to calculate the calibrated ratio, and then imported into BRB Array Tools 3.7.0, log2 transformed and median-normalized. The summary table excludes features with intensity less than 250 or low overall ArraySuite quality metrics (Q less than 0.3).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "After irradiation, blood samples were diluted 1:1 with RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), as previously described (Grace et al., Int J Radiat Biol 2002; 78:1011-21; PMID 12456288), and were incubated for 6 h  at 37ºC in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.     Peripheral blood from smoker and non-smoker volunteers was drawn into 0.105 mol/l sodium citrate Vacutainer tubes (Becton Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The blood was divided into 3-ml aliquots and exposed at a rate of 0.82 Gy/min to 0, 0.1, 0.5, 2 Gy gamma-rays using a Gammacell-40 137Cs irradiator (AECL, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). Cesium-137 produces gamma rays with an energy of 0.662 MeV and has a half-life of 30.1 years. Ionizing radiation energy values were added by GeneLab.     The RNA was prepared using the PerfectPure RNA blood kit (PerfectPure, Gaithersburg, MD) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. This protocol differentially lyses red and white blood cells in whole blood to preferentially deplete globin mRNA. Remaining globin mRNA was further reduced using GLOBINclear (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) specifically to remove both a- and b-globin. The RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop-1000 spectrophotometer, and quality was monitored with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     Cyanine-3 (Cy3) labeled cRNA was prepared from 0.5 ug RNA using the One-Color Qucik Amp Labeling kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by RNAeasy column purification (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA).  Dye incorporation and cRNA yield were checked with the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer.     1.65 ug of Cy3-labelled cRNA (specific activity greater than 10.0 pmol Cy3/ug cRNA) was fragmented at 60C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 55 ul containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturers instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 55 ul of 2x GEx hybridization buffer HI-RPM was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays (G4112F) for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven.  After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent).     The scanned images were analyzed with Feature Extraction Software 9.1.3.1 (Agilent) using default parameters (protocol GE1-v1_91 and Grid: 014850_D_20070207) to obtain background subtracted and spatially detrended green Processed Signal intensities.  Features flagged in Feature Extraction as Feature Non-uniform outliers or Features not Positive and significant were excluded. Log2 transformed signal intensities were normalized to median array for all samples.     Slides were scanned immediately after washing on the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2505B) using one color scan setting for 4x44k array slides (Scan setting with eXtended dynamic range, Scan area 61x21.6 mm, Scan resolution 5um, Dye channel is set to Green and Green PMT is set to XDR Hi 100% and XDR Lo 10%).     Log2 transformed signal intensity normalized to median array     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7112 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Agilent_1-channel/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7112_Versions/GL-DPPD-7112.md), using NF_MAAgilent1ch version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAgilent1ch_1.0.4/Microarray/Agilent_1-channel/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAgilent1ch). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.1). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3). Raw data quality assurance density, pseudo image, MA, and foreground-background plots were generated using limma (version 3.50.3), and boxplots were generated using ggplot2 (version 3.4.0). The raw intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the limma (version 3.50.3) quantile method. Normalized data quality assurance density, pseudo image, and MA plots were generated using limma (version 3.50.3), and boxplots were generated using ggplot2 (version 3.4.0). Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probe using biomaRt (version 2.50.0), Ensembl database (ensembl.org, release 107). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probe to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

Potential confounding factors have not been fully addressed for gene expression-based biodosimetry approaches, such as we are developing. To begin addressing this need, we have used an ex vivo irradiated peripheral blood cell model to investigate the potential effect of smoking on the global radiation gene expression response, and looked for genes that respond to radiation differently in smokers and non-smokers, and also in males and females. The results indicate that only a small number of genes may be significantly confounded by either factor, supporting the idea of developing peripheral blood gene expression strategies for radiation biodosimetry. Blood from each of 24 different donors was exposed to four doses of ionizing radiation (0, 0.1, 0.5, or 2 Gy) and analyzed using single-color microarray hybridization. The donors represented equal numbers of male and female smokers (1 or more packs a day) and non-smokers. There are 95 data sets in the study as the sample from one of the female smokers exposed to 2 Gy was lost.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "RNA was isolated using Ribopure (Ambion, Applied Biosytems), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.     Cyanine-3 (Cy3) labeled cRNA was prepared from 300 ng RNA using the One-Color Low RNA Input Linear Amplification PLUS kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.     1.5 mg of cRNA (greater than 9 pmol Cy3 per mg cRNA) was fragmented and hybridized to Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays (G4112F) using the Gene Expression Hybridization Kit as recommended by Agilent.     Slides were scanned immediately using the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2505B) and default parameters of Feature Extraction Software 9.1 (Agilent).     Background corrected intensities were log2 transformed in BRB-ArrayTools, Version 3.8.1. Genes for which more than 10% of the data was either not above background or was a non-uniformity outlier were filtered out. Data are not normalized to preserve dependence across time points.     log2 transformed background intensities filtered out for genes with more than 10% of the data were either not above background or were a non-uniformity outlier, no further processing to preserve dependence across time points.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7112 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Agilent_1-channel/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7112_Versions/GL-DPPD-7112.md), using NF_MAAgilent1ch version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAgilent1ch_1.0.4/Microarray/Agilent_1-channel/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAgilent1ch). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.1). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3). Raw data quality assurance density, pseudo image, MA, and foreground-background plots were generated using limma (version 3.50.3), and boxplots were generated using ggplot2 (version 3.4.0). The raw intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the limma (version 3.50.3) quantile method. Normalized data quality assurance density, pseudo image, and MA plots were generated using limma (version 3.50.3), and boxplots were generated using ggplot2 (version 3.4.0). Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probe using biomaRt (version 2.50.0), Ensembl database (ensembl.org, release 107). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probe to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.15.0).     Early passage human lung fibroblast cell strain IMR-90 (Coriell repository, NJ) was sub-cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle’s medium (Gibco) and Ham’s F10 medium in a 1:1 mixture plus 15% fetal bovine serum. Young fibroblasts at population doubling less than 35 were used in all experiments.     Cells were exposed to 0 (sham irradiated) or 50 cGy 4He ions (125 keV per micron) as simulated α-particles using the track segment mode of the 5.5-MV Singletron accelerator at the Radiological Research Accelerator Facility of Columbia University. Four independent experiments were conducted, and each was performed in parallel with irradiated, bystander and sham-irradiated samples derived from a sub-cultivated pool of IMR-90 cells that were seeded from a single cryo-vial.\nDirectly irradiated (outer dish) and bystander (inner dish) cells were separated at 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 24 hours after exposure.",

          "Study Description": "The radiation bystander effect is an important component of the overall biological response of tissues and organisms to ionizing radiation. Little is known about the contribution of genome level changes in neighboring bystander cells to tissue and organ stress after irradiation. The timing of these changes is critical in the physiological context and these questions can only be answered by studying signaling and global transcriptomics in a chronological way. Here, we present a strategy to identify different biologically important signaling modules that act in concert in the radiation and bystander responses. We used time series gene expression analysis of normal human fibroblast cells measured at 0.5 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours after exposure to radiation coupled with a novel clustering method targeted to short time series, Feature Based Partitioning around medoids Algorithm (FBPA), to look for genes that were potentially co-regulated. This method uses biologically meaningful features of the expression profile and dimension augmentation to address the analysis of sparse data sets such as ours. We applied FBPA and Short Time series Expression Miner (STEM) to the same datasets and present the results of our comparisons using computational metrics as well as biological enrichment. Enrichment showed that gene expression in irradiated cells fell into broad categories of signal transduction, cell cycle/cell death and inflammation/immunity; but only FBPA clustered functions well. In bystander cells, the gene expression response was also broadly categorized into functions associated with cell communication and motility, signal transduction and inflammation; but neither STEM nor FBPA separated biological functions as well as in irradiated samples. Network analysis revealed that p53 and NF-kappaB were central players in gene expression in both irradiated and bystander gene clusters. Analysis of individual clusters also suggested new regulators of gene expression in the radiation and bystander response that may act at the epigenetic level such as histone deacetylases (HDAC1 and HDAC2) and methylases (KDM5B) that can act as strong transcription repressors. Based on these results, we propose a novel time series clustering method, FBPA, as a powerful approach that can be applied to sparse data sets (including genomic profiling data), where the choice of features selected for clustering and stringent statistical outcome analysis can augment our knowledge of the underlying cellular mechanisms in biological processes. There are 72 total samples, 4 corresponding biological replicates of IMR90 cells that were not irradiated (control=C), irradiated (alpha=A) and bystander (B), cells were harvested at 0.5 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours after treatment",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Extraction of total RNA and genomic DNA from the muscle biopsies was performed with TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Both RNA and DNA were quantified by spectrophotometric analysis and RNA used for the microarray analysis was quality-assessed by the Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 using the RNA 6000 Nano Assay Kit (Agilent Technologies, Wokingham, Berkshire, UK).     RNA from muscle tissue and Agilent One-Color RNA Spike-In RNA were labeled with reagents supplied in the Agilent Quick Amp Labeling Kit, One-Color. The labeled cRNA was then purified with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Ltd, Crawley, UK).     The labeled cRNA was hybridized using Agilent's Hybridization Kit to the Whole Human Genome Oligo Arrays. The slides were then washed in Wash Solution 1 (0.005% Triton X-102), Wash Solution 2 (0.005% Triton X-102) acetonitrile and finally contained in Agilent's Stabilization and Drying Solution.     The slides were scanned with the Agilent G2565BA Microarray Scanner System. For data extraction and quality control, the Agilent G2567AA Feature Extraction Software (v.10.5.1.1) was used.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7112 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Agilent_1-channel/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7112_Versions/GL-DPPD-7112.md), using NF_MAAgilent1ch version 1.0.3 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAgilent1ch_1.0.3/Microarray/Agilent_1-channel/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAgilent1ch).

Ten young healthy Caucasian men (24-27 years) were recruited to the study. Subjects were requested to abstain from strenuous physical activity and alcohol consumption three days prior to the examination. To ensure standardized conditions, all subjects were provided with a nutritionally standardized diet three days prior to the first experimental day and during the bed rest with adjusted caloric content to ensure weight stability. All subjects were admitted to Steno Diabetes Center for ten days and were not permitted to deviate from a half-recumbent position during this period. Toilet visits, limited to a total of 15 minutes per day, were allowed. Study subjects were allowed to use a laptop computer, watch television and read in the bed. Body weight of all subjects was recorded every morning throughout the intervention to ensure weight stability. After bed rest a DXA scan and a VO2max test was again performed. For ethical reasons and for the purpose of studying reversibility of changes in DNA methylation, gene expression and protein levels, all subjects completed a four-week retraining program after the 9 days of bed rest. The program consisted of supervised cycle ergometry 30 min/day, 5 days/week on 70% of subjects’ VO2max. Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Identical in vivo experiments were performed before and after the bed rest. The hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp procedure was initiated at 7 AM after 10-h overnight fast, where a polyethylene catheter was placed in the antecubital vein for blood sampling. A second catheter was placed in the antecubital vein of the contralateral arm for test infusions. The insulin infusion rate was 80 mU·m2·min-1 throughout the 180-min clamp. Blood samples for measurements of serum insulin (s-insulin) and serum C-peptide (s-C-peptide) were drawn at baseline and at the beginning and end of the steady-state period, which was defined as the last 30 min of the insulin stimulation. Variable infusion of unlabeled glucose (180 g/l) was used to maintain euglycemia (blood concentration of 5 mmol/l) during insulin infusion. Whole blood glucose concentration was monitored every 5 min during steady-state using a blood glucose meter (OneTouch; LifeScan, Milpitas, CA). Samples for measuring s-insulin and s-C-peptide concentrations were drawn every 30 min during the final 90 min. Blood samples for determining plasma FFA (p-FFA), plasma total cholesterol (p-total cholesterol), plasma high-density lipoprotein (p-HDL), plasma low-density lipoprotein (p-LDL), plasma very low-density lipoprotein (p-VLDL), and plasma triglycerides (p-triglycerides) were drawn at baseline, and blood samples for measuring p-FFA in the insulin-stimulated state were drawn at 360 min.     Skeletal muscle samples were collected in all participants in both the basal and insulin stimulated state before and after bed rest, but only in the basal state after four weeks of retraining. Muscle biopsies were collected from the vastus lateralis muscle using a Bergstrom needle with suction under local anesthesia (1% lidocaine). Biopsies were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and transferred to a -80ºC freezer.",

          "Study Description": "Physical inactivity is a risk factor for insulin resistance. We examined the effect of nine days of bed rest on basal and insulin stimulated expression of genes potentially involved in insulin action by applying hypothesis-generating microarray in parallel with candidate gene real-time PCR approaches in 20 healthy, young men. Furthermore, we investigated whether bed rest affected DNA methylation in the promoter region of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PPARGC1A) gene. Subjects were re-examined after four weeks of retraining. Findings: Bed rest induced insulin resistance and altered the expression of more than 4,500 genes. These changes were only partly normalized after four weeks of retraining. Pathway analyses revealed significant down-regulation of 34 pathways, predominantly those of genes associated with mitochondrial function including PPARGC1A. Despite induction of insulin resistance, bed rest resulted in a paradoxically increased response to acute insulin in the general expression of genes, particularly those involved in inflammation and endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress. Furthermore, bed rest changed gene expressions of several insulin resistance and diabetes candidate genes. We also observed a trend toward increased PPARGC1A DNA methylation after bed rest. Conclusions: Impaired expression of PPARGC1A and other genes involved in mitochondrial function as well as a paradoxically increased response to insulin of genes involved in inflammation and ER stress may contribute to the development of insulin resistance induced by bed rest. Lack of complete normalization of changes after four weeks of exercise retraining underscores the importance of maintaining a minimum of daily physical activity.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Subjects.\n\nTwenty-four healthy young European women voluntarily participated in the long-term bed rest (LTBR) study named WISE 2005 (Women International Space Simulation for Exploration). The subjects had no medical history or physical signs of neuromuscular disorder and did not regularly participate in training exercise. Eight subjects were randomly assigned to each of 3 experimental groups: those who performed BR only (BRC), those who performed BR and exercise countermeasure (BRE), and those who performed BR and nutritional countermeasure (BRN). Slight statistical differences were observed in subject age, height, and weight between BRC and BRN groups. All subjects gave informed consent to the procedures of the experimentation, which was approved by the local Ethics Committee (Comité Consultatif de Protection des Personnes dans la Recherche Biomédicale, Toulouse 1).\n\nLong-term bed rest.\n\nTwo sessions of LTBR experiments were successively conducted in the Medes-IMPS (Space Clinic, Rangueil Hospital, Toulouse, France) under the aegis of the European Space Agency (ESA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the USA (NASA), the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), and France's Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). All subjects completed a period of BR for 60 days with a 20 day ambulatory control period before BR and a 20 day recovery period after BR. Subjects remained in a head-down tilt (−6°) position, even during the exercise training, and were instructed to not produce any unnecessary movements with their limbs. They were supervised by the Medes nursing staff throughout the study, and nutritional care was taken to avoid significant changes in body mass.\n\nExercise as countermeasure (BRE group).\n\nSubjects from the BRE group performed two types of exercise: 1) 40 min of aerobic exercise at 40–80% pre-BR V02 peak, using the lower body negative pressure; and 2) 19 sessions of resistance exercise, using supine squat and calf press exercises on an inertial ergometer. These two types of exercise were never performed in the same day.\n\nNutrition as countermeasure (BRN group).\n\nProtein content in the diet was 1 g per kg body wt per day in the BRC and BRE groups. In the BRN group, dietary protein content was increased to 1.45 g per kg body wt per day. Free branched chain amino acids (3.6 g/day free leucine, 1.8 g/day free isoleucine, and 1.8 g/day free valine) were added as a supplement (Friliver, Bracco, Italy) and given during main meals to attenuate nitrogen loss during BR. Leucine content in the diet was hereby increased from the natural level of 8–20% of total amino acid content in dietary protein. Finally, total daily energy was achieved by proportionally decreasing carbohydrate and fat intake.     Total RNA was extracted from frozen samples with a polytron homogeneizer and the RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini kit (Qiagen).     500 ng total RNA was prepared for hybridization using the Amino Allyl MessageAmp II aRNA Amplification kit (Ambion). According to the manufacturer, total RNA was reverse transcribed with an oligo-dT primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter, and then converted into double-stranded cDNA. cDNA was used in an in vitro transcription (IVT) reaction in presence of amino-allyl nucleotides. After column purification, the IVT reaction yielded 30-100 ug aminoallyl cRNA. IVT products were labeled either with cyanine 3 or cyanine 5, and fragmented with RNA Fragmentation Reagents (Ambion) into lengths around 100 bases before hybridization.     Each individual cRNA sample was Cy3-labeled and mixed with an equal amount of Cy5-labeled reference sample (pool of equal quantities of cRNA from 18 Pre-BR Soleus or 23 Pre-BR Vastus Lateralis biopsies). The mixture was pre-incubated with human Cot-I DNA (Gibco-BRL), yeast tRNA, and polyA RNA, and hybridized onto duplicate microarrays.     All hybridized arrays were scanned by fluorescence confocal microscopy (Scan array 4000XL, GSI-Lumonics) anda images were quantified using Genepix Pro 5.1.0.19 Extraction Software     LOWESS normalized, background subtracted data obtained from log2 of processed Green signal/processed Red signal.

Post-BR biopsies were obtained from the same leg, in a location as close as possible to the pre-BR biopsies, 2 days before reambulation i.e., on day 59 of the BR period. All available muscle biopsies were placed on saline-soaked gauze and divided into several portions. A muscle portion (∼20 mg) was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until future use in microarray experiments.",

          "Study Description": "Microgravity has a dramatic impact on human physiology, illustrated in particular with skeletal muscle impairment. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms leading to loss of muscle mass and structural disorders is necessary for the definition of efficient clinical and spaceflight countermeasures. We investigated the effects of long-term bed rest on transcriptome of soleus (SOL) and vastus lateralis (VL) muscles in healthy women (BRC group, n equals 8), and the potential beneficial impact of protein supplementation (BRN group, n equals 8) and of a combined resistance and aerobic training (BRE group, n equals 8). Gene expression profiles were obtained using an in-house made microarray containing 6681 muscles-relevant genes. A two-class statistical analysis was applied on the 2103 genes with consolidated expression. We identified 472 and 207 modified genes, respectively for SOL and VL in BRC group. Further clustering approaches, identifying relevant biological mechanisms or pathways, underlined five main subclusters. Three are composed almost of upregulated genes involved mainly in nucleic acid and protein metabolism, and two composed almost of downregulated genes involved in energy metabolism. Exercise countermeasure demonstrated a drastic compensatory effect, decreasing the number of differentially-expressed genes by 89 and 96% in SOL and VL. In contrast, nutrition countermeasure had a moderate effect and decreased the number of differentially-expressed genes by 40 and 25% in SOL and VL. Our results allowed reporting a systematic, global and comprehensive view of long-term woman muscle atrophy and brought new lights and insights for space environment and for women who undergo a long-term clinical bed rest. Biological samples were collected from Pre- and Post- bed rest (BR) soleus and vastus lateralis biopsies of each subject from the three groups (bed rest only: BRC; Exercise: BRE; Nutrition: BRN). six technical replicate values (2 duplicate hybridizations a et b to chips with triplicate spots xxx) were obtained for each skeletal muscle sample. Thus for each subject, 12 expression measurements (6 before BR and 6 after BR) were obtained for each muscle.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "We investigated the transcription profiles in two independent human lymphoblastoid cell lines irradiated at five dose levels spanning the low-dose range of 1–10 cGy using Affymetrix microarrays (HG–U133A), containing 22,283 probes and a linear amplification procedure to improve the detection of low-abundance transcripts. Two human lymphoblastoid cell lines (GM15036 and GM15510) from the Coriell Cell Repositories, were grown in suspension in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 15% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma Aldrich), and 1× antibiotic–antimycotic (consisting of 100 units/mL penicillin G sodium, 100 g/mL streptomycin, and 0.25 g/mL amphotericin B as Fungizone in 0.85% saline; and 2 mM l-glutamine, Invitrogen). The Coriell Cell Repositories were selected from the genetic diversity set as representative of normal individuals within the U.S.A. These cell lines are used because they are EBV immortalized cells and contain normal diploid karyotypes. Cell cultures were grown in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 C, maintained at 1–10 × 10^5 cells/mL. Ten mL of culture at 2–3 × 10^5 cells/mL in T-25 flasks received fresh media 24 h before irradiation.     Approximately 5 × 10^6 cells were irradiated in 37 C media using a 137Cs Mark 1 Irradiator (J.L. Shepherd and Associates, Glendale, CA) to deliver 0 (sham) 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 cGy (dose rates: 1.5–4 cGy/min). Cesium-137 produces gamma rays with an energy of 0.662 MeV and has a half-life of 30.1 years. Ionizing radiation energy values were added by GeneLab.     Following irradiation, cells were incubated at 37 C and harvested 4 h later. Cultures were centrifuged, pellets washed with phosphate buffered saline, resuspended in 1 mL of cold culture medium, transferred to a 2 mL cryotube, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 C.     Total RNA was extracted from thawed cells (RNeasy Total RNA Isolation Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol; QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) and treated with RNasefree DNase during the isolation procedure to remove contaminating genomic DNA (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). RNA integrity and quantity were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining and spectrophotometry, or by using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and the RNA 6000 Nano Assay LabChip. Purified total RNA was stored at −80 C until further use.     Total RNA from each sample was amplified using the ARCTURUS RiboAmp kit (ARCTURUS Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). RNA amplification provides enhanced detection of low abundance transcripts while achieving greater than 70% agreement between transcripts detected with 1 or 2 rounds of amplification compared to no amplification at all. The processed RNA was then converted to double stranded cDNA, and the Enzo BioArray HighYield Transcript Kit was used for a single round of RNA amplification-based labeling (Enzo Biochem, New York, NY). Affymetrix 3'-IVT was used.     After labeling,\nthe antisense RNA was fragmented as described in the Affymetrix Gene Expression Analysis Technical Manual (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and evaluated for quality and quantity on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer prior to microarray hybridization. Thirty six Affymetrix Human Genome HG–U133A gene chips (2 cell lines to achieve biological replication, 6 doses, in triplicate) were hybridized using 15 g of fragmented complementary RNA followed by washing and staining in an Affymetrix Fluidics Workstation as described in the Expression Analysis Technical Manual (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).     Hybridized chips were scanned and signals detected using an argon-ion laser scanner (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA).     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.5 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.5/Microarray/Affymetrix/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAffymetrix). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.4). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using oligo (version 1.58.0). Raw data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). The raw probe level intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the oligo (version 1.58.0) quantile method. Normalized probe level data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). Normalized probe level data was summarized to the probeset level using the oligo (version 1.58.0) RMA method. Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probeset using biomaRt (version 2.50.0), Ensembl database (ensembl.org, release 107). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probeset to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned for every probeset that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Early passage (population doubling less than 35) IMR-90 human lung fibroblasts (Coriell repository, NJ) were sub-cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco) and Ham's F10 medium in a 1:1 mixture plus 15% fetal bovine serum. Mylar-bottomed culture dishes were prepared as described previously. An inner dish with a base of 38-micron-thick Mylar strips was inserted into a larger dish with a 6-micron Mylar base.     The 38-micron Mylar completely shields the alpha particles so that only cells on the thinner Mylar areas of the dish were directly irradiated. Cells seeded in these dishes formed a contiguous layer. Cells were exposed to 0 (sham irradiated) or 50 cGy 4He ions (125 keV per micron) as simulated alpha particles using the track segment mode of the 5.5-MV Singletron accelerator at the Radiological Research Accelerator Facility of Columbia University. This dose corresponds to an average fluence of approximately 6-12 alpha particles per cell in the irradiated sections of the dish and the probability of a cell not receiving a particle is less than 0.25%. Four independent experiments were conducted.     Directly irradiated (outer dish) and bystander (inner dish) cells were separated at specified times after irradiation. RNA isolations were performed in parallel across irradiated, bystander and sham-irradiated samples, so that all samples were collected from one sub-cultivated pool of IMR-90 cells that were seeded from a single cryo-vial. After treatment, cells were lysed in pools from Mylar dishes at 30-minute, 1-hour, 2-hour, 4-hour, 6-hour and 24-hour time points. We repeated the experiment four times to provide four biological replicates. We analyzed the 30-minute RNA pools by microarray hybridization.     RNA was isolated using Ribopure (Ambion, Life Technologies). RNA concentrations were measured using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) and RNA quality was monitored with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). All RNA samples had RNA integrity numbers greater than 9.0 and 260 nm/280 nm absorbance ratios greater than 2.     Cyanine-3 (Cy3) labeled cRNA was prepared from 0.3 ug RNA using the One-Color Low RNA Input Linear Amplification PLUS kit (Agilent). Dye incorporation and cRNA yield were monitored with the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).     1.5 g of cRNA (greater than 9 pmol Cy3 per μg cRNA) was fragmented, hybridized to Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays (G4112F) using the Gene Expression Hybridization Kit, and washed following Agilent's recommendations.     Slides were scanned with the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2505B). Default parameters of Feature Extraction Software 9.1 (Agilent) and grid version 014850_D_F_20090416 were used for image analysis, data extraction, background correction, and flagging of non-uniform features.     Background corrected intensities were log2 transformed and median-normalized in BRB-ArrayTools, Version 3.7.0. Features flagged in Feature Extraction as Feature Non-uniform outliers were excluded.",

          "Study Description": "The existence of a radiation bystander effect, in which non-irradiated cells respond to signals from irradiated cells, is well established. To understand early signaling and gene regulation in bystander cells, we used a bioinformatics approach, measuring global gene expression at 30 minutes and signaling pathways between 30 minutes and 4 hours after exposure to alpha-particles in IMR-90 fibroblasts. We used whole human genome microarrays and real time quantitative PCR to measure and validate gene expression. Microarray analysis was done using BRB-Array Tools; pathway and ontology analyses were done using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and PANTHER, respectively. We studied signaling in irradiated and bystander cells using immunoblotting and semi-quantitative image analysis. Gene ontology suggested signal transduction and transcriptional regulation responding 30 minutes after treatment affected cell structure, motility and adhesion, and interleukin synthesis. We measured time-dependent expression of genes controlled by the NF-kappaB pathway; matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 3; chemokine ligands 2, 3 and 5 and interleukins 1beta, 6 and 33. There was an increased response of this set of genes 30 minutes after treatment and another wave of induction at 4 hours. We investigated AKT-GSK3beta signaling and found both AKT and GSK3beta are hyper-phosphorylated 30 minutes after irradiation and this effect is maintained through 4 hours. In bystander cells, a similar response was seen with a delay of 30 minutes. We proposed a network model where the observed decrease in phosphorylation of beta-catenin protein after GSK3beta dependent inactivation can trigger target gene expression at later times after radiation exposure. These results are the first to show that the radiation induced bystander signal induces a widespread gene expression response at 30 minutes after treatment and these changes are accompanied by modification of signaling proteins in the PI3K-AKT-GSK3beta pathway.",

          "Study Description": "Exposure to radiation provokes cellular responses controlled in part by gene expression networks. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs which mostly regulate gene expression by degrading the messages or inhibiting translation. Here, we investigated changes in miRNA expression patterns after low (0.1 Gy) and high (2.0 Gy) doses of X-ray in human fibroblasts. At early (0.5 h) and late (6 and 24 h) time points, irradiation caused qualitative and quantitative differences in the down-regulation of miRNA levels, including miR-92b, 137, 660, and 656. A transient up-regulation of miRNAs was observed after 2 h post-irradiation following high doses of radiation, including miR-558 and 662. MicroRNA levels were inversely correlated with targets from mRNA and proteomic profiling after 2.0 Gy of radiation. MicroRNAs miR-579, 608, 548-3p, and 585 are noted for targeting genes involved in radioresponsive mechanisms, such as cell cycle checkpoint and apoptosis. We suggest here a model in which miRNAs may act as hub regulators of specific cellular responses, immediately down-regulated so as to stimulate DNA repair mechanisms, followed by up-regulation involved in suppressing apoptosis for cell survival. Taken together, miRNAs may mediate signaling pathways in sequential fashion in response to radiation, and may serve as biodosimetric markers of radiation exposure. Overall design: The gene expression patterns in human fibroblasts after 2.0 Gy of low-LET radiation was determined at 2 and 24 hrs post-irradiation time in technical triplicates. Control non-irradiated samples were also prepared in triplicates.",

          "Study Description": "Radiation affects tissue and cellular integrity at the level of DNA, protein and metabolites of the cell and extracellular space. The effects of radiation are not limited to targeted cells and tissue and radiation induced bystander effects are significant to exposed individuals in accidental or therapeutic situations. These non-targeted effects of radiation have been studied extensively at the low dose range where they appear to have adverse effects on cells and surrounding environments. The requirement of cellular contact and shared fluid media has been established as critical to the bystander effect yet there is not much known about the actual signaling mechanism and its ability to transmit the damaging effect over space and time. Experimental cell types and context within the tissue are also quite important to the nature and extent of this bystander effect and must be considered when drawing parallels at the organismal level. Our approach was to use a genomic level analysis of global mRNA expression in primary lung fibroblast cells to understand the cellular triggers and mechanism of the bystander effect. Gene ontology and pathway analyses suggested that the p53 induced transcriptional response appears muted in bystanders while cytokine and cell signaling mechanisms such as those controlled by NFkB and p38 MAPK are highly active in both populations. We validated a large number of genes that are significantly changed at 4hrs after irradiation in both irradiated and bystander populations. We investigated time course gene expression profiles of cyclooxygenase2 (PTGS2), interleukin 8 (IL8) and BCL2 related protein 2 (BCL2A1), as genes that are involved in cellular signaling via the NFkB pathway, which revealed that there is a dramatic response at 0.5hr after irradiation followed by another wave at 4hr in both populations. The induction of interleukins such as cytokine IL8 and chemokine IL6 at the transcriptional level is both early and amplified and if followed by translation and secretion of these proteins could explain the concerted response seen in bystander cells. Our results are the first to show that there is a significant and distinct global response of cellular signaling genes in bystander cells with some genes showing a response as early as 0.5hr after irradiation which implies a fast moving intercellular signal that leads to a concerted response in the irradiated and bystander populations. Keywords: gene expression fold change There are 12 total samples, 4 corresponding biological replicates of IMR90 cells that were not irradiated (control=C), irradiated (alpha=A) and bystander (B)",

          "Managing NASA Center": "",
          "Study Description": "Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFbeta) is a tumor suppressor during the initial stage of tumorigenesis, but it can switch to a tumor promoter during neoplastic progression. Ionizing radiation (IR), both a carcinogen and a therapeutic agent, induces TGFbeta activation in vivo. We now show that IR sensitizes human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) to undergo TGFbeta-mediated epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Non-malignant HMEC (MCF10A, HMT3522 S1 and 184v) were irradiated with 2 Gy shortly after attachment in monolayer culture, or treated with a low concentration of TGFbeta (0.4 ng/ml), or double-treated. All double-treated (IR+TGFbeta) HMEC underwent a morphological shift from cuboidal to spindle-shaped. This phenotype was accompanied by decreased expression of epithelial markers E-cadherin, beta-catenin and ZO-1, remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, and increased expression of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, fibronectin and vimentin. Furthermore, double-treatment increased cell motility, promoted invasion and disrupted acinar morphogenesis of cells subsequently plated in Matrigel. Neither radiation nor TGFbeta alone elicited EMT, even though IR increased chronic TGFbeta signaling and activity. Gene expression profiling revealed that double treated cells exhibit a specific 10-gene signature associated with Erk/MAPK signaling. We hypothesized that IR-induced MAPK activation primes non-malignant HMEC to undergo TGFbeta-mediated EMT. Consistent with this, Erk phosphorylation were transiently induced by irradiation, persisted in irradiated cells treated with TGFbeta, and treatment with U0126, a Mek inhibitor, blocked the EMT phenotype. Together, these data demonstrate that the interactions between radiation-induced signaling pathways elicit heritable phenotypes that could contribute to neoplastic progression. Experiment Overall Design: Nonmalignant human mammary epithelial MCF10A cells (passages 106 and 108) were seeded at cloning density in 35mm dishes (10^5 cells/dish). Cell culture medium consisted of 3ml/dish of MGEM serum free medium (Cambrex Inc.), supplemented or not with 400pg/ml recombinant Transforming Growth Factor-beta. Cells were irradiated or not 5h post plating using 160 KV X-ray with a total dose of 2Gy. Sham, IR-treated, TGFbeta-treated and double-treated (IR+TGFbeta) MCF10A cells were harvested 8 days post-IR. Briefly, cells were washed with PBS, denatured in Trizol, scraped off the dish and subjected to chloroform extraction. After centrifugation, the upper phase was precipitated with an equal volume of isopropanol. RNA precipitates were resuspended in RNase free water and further purified on RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Germany). RNA quality was assessed on an Agilent Bio-Analyzer. The dataset analyzed by microarray included biological duplicates for each treatment in two independent experiments and three sham treated samples. Microarray data were generated at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Molecular Profiling Laboratory (http://hta.lbl.gov) using a high-throughput, automated GeneChip system (Affymetrix). Briefly, target preparation, HT_HG-U133A array plate hybridization setup, washing and staining were performed on an Affymetrix robotic system (GCAS) using version 2.1 protocols.

          "Study Protocol Description": "Freshly drawn peripheral blood from healthy volunteers was irradiated, then diluted 1:1 with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum.  The cultures were incubated for 6 or 24 hours at 37C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.     3 ml aliquots of blood were exposed at a rate of 0.82 Gy per minute to 0, 0.5, 2, 5 or 8 Gy g-rays using a Gammacell-40 137Cs irradiator, then incubated for 6 or 24 hours prior to RNA extraction. Cesium-137 produces gamma rays with an energy of 0.662 MeV and has a half-life of 30.1 years. Ionizing radiation energy values were added by GeneLab.     RNA was prepared using the Versagene Blood RNA Purification kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis MN) following the manufacturer's recommendations.  The protocol includes differential lysis of red and white blood cells, and an on-column DNase digestion.  Globin message was further reduced using GLOBINclear (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) to specifically remove both a- and b- globin. RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop-1000 spectrophotometer and quality was monitored with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     Cyanine-3 (Cy3) labeled cRNA was prepared from 0.5ug RNA using the One-Color Low RNA Input Linear Amplification PLUS kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by RNAeasy column purification (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA).  Dye incorporation and cRNA yield were checked with the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer.     1.5 ug of Cy3-labelled cRNA (specific activity greater than 10.0 pmol Cy3/μg cRNA) was fragmented at 60C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 250 ml containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturers instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 250 ml of 2x Agilent hybridization buffer was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays (G4112A) for 17 hours at 65C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven.  After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately by brief centrifugation.     Slides were scanned immediately after washing on the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2505B) using one color scan setting for 1x44k array slides (Scan Area 61x21.6 mm, Scan resolution 10μm, Dye channel is set to Green and Green PMT is set to 100%).     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7112 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Agilent_1-channel/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7112_Versions/GL-DPPD-7112.md), using NF_MAAgilent1ch version 1.0.3 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAgilent1ch_1.0.3/Microarray/Agilent_1-channel/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAgilent1ch). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.1). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3). Raw data quality assurance density, pseudo image, MA, and foreground-background plots were generated using limma (version 3.50.3), and boxplots were generated using ggplot2 (version 3.4.0). The raw intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the limma (version 3.50.3) quantile method. Normalized data quality assurance density, pseudo image, and MA plots were generated using limma (version 3.50.3), and boxplots were generated using ggplot2 (version 3.4.0). Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probe using the Ensembl database ftp server (ensembl.org, release 107). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probe to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Description": "To further develop our gene expression approach to biodosimetry, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to distinguish radiation dose across an exposure range relevant for medical decision-making in a radiological emergency. Human peripheral blood from healthy donors was irradiated ex vivo, and a 74-gene consensus signature was identified that distinguished between four radiation doses (0.5, 2, 5 and 8 Gy) and control samples. The same set of genes separated samples by exposure level at both six and 24 hours after treatment, with overlap evident only at the highest two doses (5 and 8 Gy). Expression of five genes (CDKN1A, FDXR, SESN1, BBC3 and PHPT1) from this signature was quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR, confirming low variability between donors as well as the predicted radiation response pattern. Experiment Overall Design: Radiation induced gene expression in human blood was measured at 6 and 24 hours after exposure to doses of 0, 0.5, 2, 5 and 8 Gy g-rays. Five independent experiments were performed at each time (6 or 24 hours) using different donors for each experiment",

To generate the HBEC-EGFP 53BP1 stable line, HBECs were transfected with linearized EGFP-53BP1 mammalian expression plasmid (pcDNA, Invitrogen) using Nucleofector (Amaxa). The cells were selected with 20 µg/ml hygromycin for 10 days. Stable lines were maintained as described previously.\n\n3D organotypic culture\n\nConstruction of 3D organotypic HBEC cultures was performed as described previously with the following modifications: HBECs were suspended in Bronchiole Epithelial Basal Medium (BEBM, Lonza) and DMEM high glucose with l-glutamine and sodium pyruvate (Hyclone) at a 1:1 ratio. The medium was supplemented with 5 µg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 0.05 µM hydrocortisone, 0.5 ng/ml hEGF, 1.35 µM epinephrine, 0.46 µM insulin, 5 nM triiodothyronine, 62.5 nM transferrin, 25 nM retinoic acid and 1 mM calcium chloride. Cell suspensions (20 µl) at a density of 1.5 million cells/ml were resuspended in 250 µl pre-thawed Growth Factor Reduced Phenol-Red Free Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and seeded into single, 24-mm diameter Transwell® permeable inserts with 0.4 µm pore size (Corning, Lowell, MA, USA). Matrigel cultures in the Transwell® permeable inserts were allowed to gel for 30 min at 37°C and then 200 µl BEBM:DMEM media with supplements was added. One hundred thousand IMR90 human lung fibroblasts in 500 µl BEBM:DMEM media with supplements were pre-seeded into single wells of a 12-well tissue culture plate (BD Falcon) 48 h prior to the experiment. Matrigel cultures in Transwell® permeable inserts were then placed on top of the IMR 90 cultures to receive growth stimulus. Cultures were grown at 37°C for 5 days with media changed every 2 days. After 5 days, Matrigel cultures were separated from the IMR90 coculture and were maintained at 37°C for ∼9 days. For branching analysis, cultures were maintained at 37°C for an additional 15 days with IMR90 coculture to provide growth as well as differentiation stimuli.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Total RNA was isolated utilizing the RNeasy isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, cell pellets were lysed and homogenized followed by the addition of ethanol to optimize binding of RNA to the spin column. Contaminants were removed via washing by centrifugation and total RNA was eluted in water. RNA was then analyzed for quality utilizing the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and the concentration was determined using the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer.     RNA quality check, labeling and hyb followed standard affymetrix procedures.\n\nLabel: biotinylation     RNA quality check, labeling and hyb followed standard affymetrix procedures.     Microarray analysis was performed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human U133A array as described in the Affymetrix Analysis Technical Manual.     Microarrays were performed in triplicate using RNA isolated from the activated lymphocytes of three different blood donors. A cutoff was set at greater than or equal to 1.5-fold for analysis and for identifying genes of interest with the criterion for significance less than 0.01.     Isolation and Activation of Human Lymphocytes: Buffy coats containing human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center (Houston, TX). PBMCs were separated by centrifugation through a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient. The lymphocyte layer was extracted. The cells were washed with hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) and resuspended in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Lymphocytes were activated by adding of 100 ng/ml of anti-CD3 (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and 100 U/ml of IL-2 (Aldesleukin Proleukin—Chiron—Emeryville, CA) for 4 days. After that the cells were washed and placed in RPMI media containing 10% FBS and 100 U/ml IL-2 and cultured up to 2 weeks in static conditions with media replacement every 3–4 days. This procedure allowed to obtain pure population of activated T-cells. The purity of the cell population was confirmed by Flow cytometry analysis. Simulated Microgravity and Static 1g Cell Cultures: To approximate MG conditions we used a specialized RWV culture system developed at the NASA-Johnson Space Center and commercially available from Synthecon, Inc. (Houston, TX). This very low-shear culture system randomizes gravitational vectors and approximates the microgravity environment by sustaining cells in continuous free fall  This culture system has been successfully used in previous studies for the analysis of the effects of microgravity on PBMC locomotion on Earth and in parallel studies on Earth and in Space performed during space flight missions STS-54 and STS-56. Preliminary activated T-cells were split in two portions. One was further maintained in static (1 g) conditions and the other—placed in RWV bioreactor for 24 h at 37°C in atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 1 × 10^6 cells/ml cell density. RWV bioreactor was continuously turned at a speed of 22 rpm.     Upon completion of the incubation the cells were washed with PBS and the cell pellets were frozen and placed in −80°C.",
