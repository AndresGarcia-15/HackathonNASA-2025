          "Study Protocol Description": "Cell culture and cryopreservation of cardiac progenitor spheres\nFor the spaceflight experiment, we prepared cryopreserved cardiac progenitor spheres from IMR90 hiPSC lines (WiCell Research Institute) that were cultured in a feeder-free condition on Matrigel-coated plates and daily fed with mTeSR1 medium. For the induction of IMR90 cardiomyocyte differentiation, hiPSCs were treated with growth factors. Briefly, when compact colonies reached greater than 95% confluence, cells were treated with 100 ng/mL activin A from differentiation day 0 till day 1 and then 10 ng/mL bone morphogenic protein-4 (BMP4) from day 1 till day 4 in RPMI/B27 insulin-free medium (RPMI 1640 with 2% B27 minus insulin). Cells were maintained in RPMI/B27 medium (RPMI 1640 with 2% B27 supplement with insulin) until differentiation day 6 when cardiac progenitor spheres were generated using microscale tissue engineering using Aggrewell 400 plates (STEMCELL Technologies). Briefly, cells were dissociated using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific), resuspended for cell counting, then seeded into the Aggrewell 400 plates at a concentration of 1.8 × 10^6 cells/well (1500 cells/microwell). Cells were cultured in RPMI/B27 medium and 10 uM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 to facilitate cell survival following dissociation. After 24 h, cardiac spheres were cryopreserved.\n\nFor cryopreservation, cardiac progenitor spheres were resuspended in 0.5 mL cryopreservation medium (90% fetal bovine serum and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide with 10 uM ROCK inhibitor) and transferred into cryosyringes at 0.5 mL/cryosyringe. Cardiac spheres were initially pre-cooled at 4 C for up to 25 min to maximize cryopreservation efficiency and then stored at −80 C in a cooling box.     ISS cell culture operation\nFor thawing cells on the ISS, cryosyringes containing cardiac progenitor spheres were placed in a thermoblock at 37 C for 5 min. The cells were then injected into cell culture chambers of the MVP modules containing a CO2-independent medium with 10 uM ROCK inhibitor. The MVP modules were re-installed into the MVP facility, which started with a medium flush cycle to replace the medium with a new culture medium (20 mL per chamber; ~2× chamber volume), to flush out the DMSO in the cryopreserved cell solution (0.5 mL/cryosyringe). The cells were cultured at 37 C in the MVP system for 22 days on the ISS with medium exchange every other day.     At the end of the mission, live cultures were returned to the ground via warm storage after having been cultured aboard the ISS. Upon arrival at Emory University, cardiac spheres were transferred immediately into an incubator and let recover overnight. The following day cardiac spheres were transferred from the collection bags into low adhesion dishes. Medium was changed from CO2-independent medium to standard cardiomyocyte culture medium (RPMI/B27 medium), and cardiac spheres were then maintained overnight, followed by RNA isolation.     RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration was measured using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA sequencing, quality control, and transcriptome mapping were done by the Yerkes National Primate Research Center of Emory University. Total RNA quality was tested using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation and RNA 6000 Nano and Pico Chip (Agilent Technologies). RNA samples of triplicate ISS uG and ISS 1G cultures collected after long-term exposure to space microgravity were subjected to library preparation and sequencing.     Two nanograms of total RNA were used as input for cDNA synthesis, using the Clontech SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit (Takara Bio) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Amplified cDNA was fragmented and appended with dual-indexed bar codes using the NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation kit (Illumina). Libraries were validated by capillary electrophoresis on an Agilent 4200 TapeStation. Libraries were pooled at equimolar concentrations.     Library pools were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 at 100SR, yielding an average of 30 million reads per sample.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 13-May-2024.",

          "Study Description": "Efficient generation of cardiomyocytes from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) is important for their application in basic and translational studies. Space microgravity can significantly change cell activities and function. Previously, we reported upregulation of genes associated with cardiac proliferation in cardiac progenitors derived from hiPSCs that were exposed to space microgravity for 3 days. Here we investigated the effect of long-term exposure of hiPSC-cardiac progenitors to space microgravity on global gene expression. Cryopreserved 3D hiPSC-cardiac progenitors were sent to the International Space Station (ISS) and cultured for 3 weeks under ISS microgravity and ISS 1 G conditions. RNA-sequencing analyses revealed upregulation of genes associated with cardiac differentiation, proliferation, and cardiac structure/function and downregulation of genes associated with extracellular matrix regulation in the ISS microgravity cultures compared with the ISS 1 G cultures. Gene ontology analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes mapping identified the upregulation of biological processes, molecular function, cellular components, and pathways associated with cell cycle, cardiac differentiation, and cardiac function. Taking together, these results suggest that space microgravity has a beneficial effect on the differentiation and growth of cardiac progenitors.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "The mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) were derived from a healthy, de-identified, discarded bone marrow sample using Histopaque-1077 (Sigma-Aldrich) according to density gradient protocols. The MSCs were grown in α minimum essential medium supplemented with 16.5% fetal bovine serum. The expanded MSCs were then seeded into BioCells at passage 4. The BioCells were divided into groups for 1-week or 2-week durations. The 1-week group was seeded with 5x10^4 MSCs, while the 2-week group was seeded with 2x10^4 MSCs. Identical BioCells were prepared as ground controls. All procedures fully complied with relevant regulations and Mayo Clinic’s IRB guidelines.     The experiments utilized BioServe’s single-well BioCell, a spaceflight-certified cell culture hardware capable of effectively supporting cell culture. MSCs-containing BioCells were transported to the ISS microgravity environment within Plate Habitats (PHABs). During launch rocket’s gravity forces can reach up to 5g. Upon arrival at the ISS, the PHABs were placed inside BioServe’s SABL unit, which maintains a temperature of 37°C and 5% CO2. MSCs cultures were processed at two intervals: 7 days and 14 days. Seeding densities were adjusted such that no media exchange was performed at ISS. Ground control MSCs underwent identical treatment to those in the microgravity environment.     At the designated termination timepoints, specifically after either one or two weeks of culture in space aboard the ISS, MSCs were subjected to trypsinization. This process facilitated the retrieval of single-cell suspensions, which were subsequently preserved in RNAprotect (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD) while still aboard the ISS.     Upon return to Earth, RNA isolation was conducted utilizing the miRNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD). Total RNA concentration and quality were determined using Qubit fluorometry (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and the Agilent Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA).     cDNA libraries were prepared using up to 200ng of total RNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions for the TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The concentration and size distribution of the completed libraries were determined using the Bioanalyzer and Qubit fluorometry.     Libraries were sequenced at an average of 35 million, 100 base pair paired-end reads per sample with Illumina’s standard protocol for the Illumina cBot and HiSeq 3000/4000 PE Cluster Kit.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.",

          "Study Description": "With technological advancements, human's desire to explore space is growing and more people are staying longer at the international space station (ISS). The impact of microgravity on stem cells (SC) is not fully understood. We explored the impact of microgravity on gene expression profile of cultured mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) at the ISS. We also evaluated how the new knowledge gained sheds light on our understanding of human physiology on Earth. Primary cultures of MSCs were expanded at the ISS for 1 or 2 weeks and mRNA was isolated from samples of the cultured cells. Gene expression profiles were determined and compared with samples from real-time ground control cultures. Differential gene expression, gene set enrichment analysis and determination of key genes were performed that revealed for the first time the existence of potential 'master regulators' coordinating a systemic response to microgravity. Cyclin D1 (CCND1), a protein-coding gene that regulates cell cycle progression and CDK kinases, was identified as the most connected regulator at week 1. Further analysis showed the impacted genes from cultured MSCs significantly correlated with known gene pathways associated with cell division, chromosomal segregation and nuclear division, extracellular matrix structure and organization, muscle apoptosis and differentiation. This study exemplifies the utility of space research to advance our understanding of human physiology both on Earth and in space. To investigate the effects of microgravity on MSC growth and understand the differences in gene expression profiles between microgravity and ground control environments, two groups of MSC were sent to the ISS. One group was cultured for one week, while the other was cultured for two weeks, with corresponding control groups processed similarly on Earth. The cells were then preserved and transferred back to the laboratory. Further Gene expression profiles were compared between samples to identify differentially expressed genes.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "This study was performed using 4 iPSC lines. iPSC line 051121-01-MR-017 and AK003-01-MR-008 were previously reprogrammed from dermal fibroblasts with an mRNA/miRNA method.  iPSC line HDF410iPS5044 and iPSC line UEC741iPS517 were previously reprogrammed from dermal fibroblasts and urine epithelial cells, respectively using non-integrating Sendai virus.  iPSC lines were expanded and maintained in mTeSR1 medium, following published methods, assessed for pluripotency using RNAseq and PluriTest and for genomic integrity with single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays. iPSC lines 051121-01-MR017 and AK003-01-MR-008 were differentiated into cortical neural precursors using established protocols and iPSC lines HDF410iPS504 and UEC741iPS517 were differentiated into dopaminergic neural precursors.  Twenty-five days after differentiation was initiated, both cortical and dopaminergic precursors were dissociated and cryopreserved. Microglia were separately derived from all 4 cell lines. A week before the estimated launch date, cryopreserved neural precursors\nwere thawed, washed in DMEM/F12, and spun at 300g for 5 minutes. Cell pellets were resuspended in cortical neuron medium or dopaminergic neuron medium and plated at a density of 1 × 10^5 cells/well onto ULA V-bottom plates (Sbio MS-9096VZ) and incubated overnight at 37 C, 5% CO2, to allow cell aggregation into spherical organoids. For half of the samples, 10^4 iPSC-derived microglia were added to the matched organoids after 24 hours, and IL-34 (100 ng/mL) and GM-CSF (10 ng/mL) were included in the medium to promote microglial maturation. Cultures were incubated for an additional 24 hours before being shipped at 4 C to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for payload preparation and launch.     Each organoid was transferred into a cryovial (NUNC Coded Cryobank Vial, Thermo Fisher Scientific  374088), containing 1 mL of cortical or dopaminergic neuron medium with the addition of IL-34 (100 ng/mL) and GM-CSF (10 ng/mL) for those containing microglia. The basal medium was DMEM/F-12 buffered with 15 mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific  11330). The cryovials were closed and loaded into a CubeLab (Space Tango), a miniaturized incubator that maintains a stable temperature of 37 C. The CubeLab was then transferred to the rocket and after 2 days, launched into low-Earth orbit onboard the SpaceX 19th Commercial Resupply Services mission (SpX CRS-19) to the ISS for a 30-day stay in microgravity. Under similar conditions, ground control samples were kept at the KSC laboratory.     After 30 days, the Dragon capsule carrying the organoids back to Earth splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, and the CubeLab was opened six days post-undock from the ISS. Nine organoids cultured in LEO and 10 from ground control, both with and without added microglia, were snap-frozen and stored at −80 C.     RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Micro kit (QIAGEN  74004). To maximize the yield, the RNA was eluted into 12 uL of ultrapure DI water. The RNA concentrations were assessed with the RNA 6000 Pico assay (Bioanalyzer; Agilent).     The RNA was sequenced by an outside provider (Novogene; https://www.novogene.com/us-en/) that used an ultra-low input preparation of samples with a minimum of 10 ng of RNA and the Illumina NovaSeq Platform for high-throughput sequencing. A pilot subset of samples were cDNA amplified before sequencing with the Clontech SMART kit employing Clontech SMART CDS Primer IIA. Remaining samples used Nextera library preparation.     All samples were then sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Platform for high-throughput PE150 sequencing.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.12.1 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.26. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 09-May-2025.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.2 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.2/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Homo Sapiens STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCh38 (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.112.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Homo Sapiens STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to none and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.19.1).",

          "Study Description": "Research conducted on the International Space Station (ISS) in low-Earth orbit (LEO) has shown the effects of microgravity on multiple organs. To investigate the effects of microgravity on the central nervous system, we developed a unique organoid strategy for modeling specific regions of the brain that are affected by neurodegenerative diseases. We generated 3-dimensional human neural organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from individuals affected by primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) or Parkinson's disease (PD) and non-symptomatic controls, by differentiating them toward cortical and dopaminergic fates, respectively, and combined them with isogenic microglia. The organoids were cultured for a month using a novel sealed cryovial culture method on the International Space Station (ISS) and a parallel set that remained on Earth. Live samples were returned to Earth for analysis by RNA expression and histology and were attached to culture dishes to enable neurite outgrowth. Our results show that both cortical and dopaminergic organoids cultured in LEO had lower levels of genes associated with cell proliferation and higher levels of maturation-associated genes, suggesting that the cells matured more quickly in LEO. This study is continuing with several more missions in order to understand the mechanisms underlying accelerated maturation and to investigate other neurological diseases. Our goal is to make use of the opportunity to study neural cells in LEO to better understand and treat neurodegenerative disease on Earth and to help ameliorate potentially adverse neurological effects of space travel. This study hosts data from cortical organoids. Data for the dopaminergic organoids is available under OSD-871.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "This study was performed using 4 iPSC lines. iPSC line 051121-01-MR-017 and AK003-01-MR-008 were previously reprogrammed from dermal fibroblasts with an mRNA/miRNA method.  iPSC line HDF410iPS5044 and iPSC line UEC741iPS517 were previously reprogrammed from dermal fibroblasts and urine epithelial cells, respectively using non-integrating Sendai virus.  iPSC lines were expanded and maintained in mTeSR1 medium, following published methods, assessed for pluripotency using RNAseq and PluriTest and for genomic integrity with single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays. iPSC lines 051121-01-MR017 and AK003-01-MR-008 were differentiated into cortical neural precursors using established protocols and iPSC lines HDF410iPS504 and UEC741iPS517 were differentiated into dopaminergic neural precursors.  Twenty-five days after differentiation was initiated, both cortical and dopaminergic precursors were dissociated and cryopreserved. Microglia were separately derived from all 4 cell lines. A week before the estimated launch date, cryopreserved neural precursors\nwere thawed, washed in DMEM/F12, and spun at 300g for 5 minutes. Cell pellets were resuspended in cortical neuron medium10 or dopaminergic neuron medium and plated at a density of 1 × 10^5 cells/well onto ULA V-bottom plates (Sbio MS-9096VZ) and incubated overnight at 37 C, 5% CO2, to allow cell aggregation into spherical organoids. For half of the samples, 10^4 iPSC-derived microglia were added to the  matched organoids after 24 hours, and IL-34 (100 ng/mL) and GM-CSF (10 ng/mL) were included in the medium to promote microglial maturation. Cultures were incubated for an additional 24 hours before being shipped at 4 C to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for payload preparation and launch.     Each organoid was transferred into a cryovial (NUNC Coded Cryobank Vial, Thermo Fisher Scientific  374088), containing 1 mL of cortical or dopaminergic neuron medium with the addition of IL-34 (100 ng/mL) and GM-CSF (10 ng/mL) for those containing microglia. The basal medium was DMEM/F-12 buffered with 15 mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific  11330). The cryovials were closed and loaded into a CubeLab (Space Tango), a miniaturized incubator that maintains a stable temperature of 37 C. The CubeLab was then transferred to the rocket and after 2 days, launched into low-Earth orbit onboard the SpaceX 19th Commercial Resupply Services mission (SpX CRS-19) to the ISS for a 30-day stay in microgravity. Under similar conditions, ground control samples were kept at the KSC laboratory.     After 30 days, the Dragon capsule carrying the organoids back to Earth splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, and the CubeLab was opened six days post-undock from the ISS. Eleven organoids cultured in LEO and 12 from ground control, both with and without added microglia, were snap-frozen and stored at −80 C.     RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Micro kit (QIAGEN  74004). To maximize the yield, the RNA was eluted into 12 uL of ultrapure DI water. The RNA concentrations were assessed with the RNA 6000 Pico assay (Bioanalyzer; Agilent).     The RNA was sequenced by an outside provider (Novogene; https://www.novogene.com/us-en/) that used an ultra-low input preparation of samples with a minimum of 10 ng of RNA and the Illumina NovaSeq Platform for high-throughput sequencing. A pilot subset of samples were cDNA amplified before sequencing with the Clontech SMART kit employing Clontech SMART CDS Primer IIA. Remaining samples used Nextera library preparation.     All samples were then sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Platform for high-throughput PE150 sequencing.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.12.1 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.26. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 09-May-2025.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.2 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.2/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Homo Sapiens STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCh38 (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.112.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Homo Sapiens STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4).

          "Study Protocol Description": "Cell culture: Deidentified human cortical kidney samples were collected through the Northwest Biotrust at the University of Washington Medical Center with local IRB approval (UW IRB Study 1297). Primary human proximal tubule epithelial cells were isolated by mechanical and enzymatic dissociation and cultured as previously described. Serum-free tubular cell cultures were maintained in PTEC maintenance media consisting of DMEM/F12 (Gibco, 11330-032) supplemented with 1× insulin-transferrin-selenium-sodium pyruvate (ITS-A, Gibco, 51300044), 50 nM hydrocortisone (Sigma, H6909), and 1× Antibiotic–Antimycotic (Gibco, 15240062). Upon reaching 70–80% confluence, PTECs were passaged by enzymatic digestion with 0.05% trypsin EDTA (Gibco, 25200056) and manual cell scraping to obtain a single-cell suspension that was subsequently neutralized with defined trypsin inhibitor (Gibco, R007100). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 200 × g for 6 min, resuspended in maintenance media, and plated in cell culture-treated flasks at greater than 30% confluency. PTECs were used at passage number 2–3 from all donors in these experiments. Microphysiological devices: Triplex microfluidic devices were purchased from Nortis, Inc. (Bothell, WA) and prepared as previously described. Triplex microfluidic devices contain three fluidic circuits, which enable the generation of three PTEC tubules on a single device that can be continuously perfused with media.     The BioServe perfusion platform was developed to house three Triplex devices in a self-contained, hermetically sealed system to meet the levels of containment required by NASA and reduce the space required to perfuse the Triplex devices. A flow rate of 0.5 µL/min was used for cell maintenance and treatment. The treatment conditions were control (PTEC maintenance media), vitamin D, or 2% human serum. After delivery and installation on board the ISS, cells were acclimated to microgravity for 6 days. Maintenance media cassettes were switched to treatment media cassettes containing either maintenance media, 2% human serum, or 3 µM vitamin D binding protein (DBP) + 1.5 µM vitamin D (25(OH)D3) and treated for 48 h prior to fixation with either RNA later for RNAseq or formalin. Ground controls were conducted using minute-to-minute time matching with on-station timing, with a 36 h delay. To prepare 2% human serum treatment media, normal human serum (Valley Biomedical, HS1021) was diluted in PTEC maintenance media to a final concentration of 2%. Vitamin D treatment media consisted of PTEC maintenance media supplemented with 1.5 µM 25(OH)D3 (Toronto Research Chemicals, C125700) and 3 µM DBP (Athens Research, 16-16-070307). To prepare vitamin D treatment media, stock 25(OH)D3 was solubilized with molecular biology grade ethanol to 5 mM. DBP was reconstituted to 3 µM in PTEC maintenance media to create PTEC-DBP media. 25(OH)D3 was then diluted into PTEC-DBP media to 1.5 µM. Vitamin D media was allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 30 min prior to filling the treatment cassette to ensure binding of 25(OH)D3 to DBP. The final concentration of ethanol in the vitamin D treatment media was 0.02%.     In order to preserve the tubules at the end of treatment for analyses, the devices were fixed for 2 h with RNALater (ThermoFisher, AM7024) at a flow rate of 10 µL/min.     RNA was isolated from devices fixed with RNALater by injecting 100 µL of RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen, 79216) into the injection port using a 1 mL syringe outfitted with a 22-gauge needle. The cell lysate was collected at the outlet, 400 µL of RLT lysis buffer was added to each tube, and the samples were stored at −80 °C until extraction. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, 74004) and converted to cDNA with the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit (Takara, 634891).     Sequencing libraries were constructed using the SMARTer ThruPlex DNA-Seq Kit (Takara, R400676).     Sequencing libraries were sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA).     Sequencing reads were aligned to GRCh38.p12 with reference transcriptome GENCODE human release 30 (with additional ERCC spike-in sequences) using STAR (v2.6.1d).     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 13-May-2024.

Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method.

          "Study Description": "The microgravity environment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) provides a unique stressor that can help understand underlying cellular and molecular drivers of pathological changes observed in astronauts with the ultimate goals of developing strategies to enable long- term spaceflight and better treatment of diseases on Earth. We used this unique environment to evaluate the effects of microgravity on kidney proximal tubule epithelial cell (PTEC) response to serum exposure and vitaminD biotransformation capacity. To test if microgravity alters the pathologic response of the proximal tubule to serum exposure, we treated PTECs cultured in a microphysiological system (PT-MPS) with human serum and measured biomarkers of toxicity and inflammation (KIM-1 and IL-6) and conducted global transcriptomics via RNAseq on cells undergoing flight (microgravity) and respective controls(ground). Given the profound bone loss observed in microgravity and PTECs produce the active form of vitamin D, we treated 3D cultured PTECs with 25(OH)D 3 (vitamin D) and monitored vitamin D metabolite formation, conducted global transcriptomics via RNAseq, and evaluated transcript expression of CYP27B1, CYP24A1, or CYP3A5 in PTECs undergoing flight (microgravity) and respective ground controls. We demonstrated that microgravity neither altered PTEC metabolism of vitamin D nor did it induce a unique response of PTECs to human serum, suggesting that these fundamental biochemical pathways in the kidney proximal tubule are not significantly altered by short-term exposure to microgravity. Given the prospect of extended spaceflight, more study is needed to determine if these responses are consistent with extended (greater than 6 months) exposure to microgravity.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Cell Culture\nPrimary human skeletal muscle cells (Cell Applications) from two individual donors (37- 41 years old) were expanded in growth media consisting of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37C and 5% CO2. The primary cells were used within one passage of thawing.\nFabrication of Aligned Nanofibrillar Collagen Strips\n\nPreparation of the parallel-aligned collagen scaffold was prepared using a shear-based extrusion method, as described in our previous publications. Briefly, rat-tail monomeric collagen type I (10 mg/ml in 0.02 N in acetic acid, pH 3.5, Corning) was dialyzed using polyethylene glycol (PEG, Sigma) flakes. Every 15 minutes, the moistened PEG flakes from the surface of the dialysis tubing were removed and replaced with dry PEG flakes and then returned to 4C. After 30 minutes, the tubing was placed in a container with MilliQ water, and the moistened PEG was removed from the tubing surface. The dialyzed collagen was spun down at 3000rpm for 1 min to remove air bubbles. Meanwhile, glass slides were submerged inside a Petri dish at 37 C containing PBS (10X, pH 7.4). Dialyzed monomeric collagen was loaded into a 1-ml syringe with a 22G blunt needle. Thin strips of collagen were extruded onto the glass slides using a steady sideways motion. Extrusion directly into a pH neutral buffer induced fibrillogenesis of the collagen fibrils along the direction of extrusion. The collagen strips were carefully removed from the glass slide, and then 8 strips were adhered as a bundle onto a hydrophobic glass chip (~25x15mm, Schott H, Nexterion). The collagen strips on the glass chips were dried for 2 hours at room temperature until salt crystals started to cover 50%-90% of the surface area. Subsequently, the scaffolds were washed with PBS (1X) and then dried for 24 hours before use. Routine scanning electron microscopy was performed based on previous studies.\n\nGeneration of Muscle-on-a-Chip Bioconstructs and Assembly of Bioreactor\nThe parallel-aligned nanofibrillar collagen scaffolds immobilized on glass chips were disinfected by soaking in 70% ethanol for 10 minutes, air dried, and then rinsed in PBS (1X) three times before placing into a 6-well plate. Primary human skeletal muscle cells (~2x10^5 cells, Cell Applications) from two donors were seeded onto each glass chip and incubated for 24 hours in growth medium. The cell-seeded glass chip is denoted as a ‘muscle-on-a-chip’. The muscle- on-a-chip from each donor was transferred to one chamber of a custom-built 4-chamber bioreactor (BioCell, Bioserve Space Technologies) and filled with growth media. Each tissue chip was immobilized to the bottom of the bioreactor using a stabilizing bridge and overlayed with medium. Once tissue chips were in place, the bioreactor assembly was completed using a transparent oxygen-permeable fluorinated ethylene propylene and bioreactor lid, removing air bubbles and rendering a sealed environment.     Flight Experiment in Microgravity\nDuring transit to the International Space Station National Laboratories (ISSNL) on the NASA Commercial Resupply Mission (NG-16) Cygnus spacecraft, the bioreactors containing muscle-on-a-chip bioconstructs were housed inside space habitats that maintained ~37C and 5% CO2 for 7 days without changing their medium. After docking to the ISSNL, the bioreactors were transferred by space astronauts (or flight crew) to the Space Automated Bioproduct Lab for active maintenance of 37C and 5% CO2 conditions. The media was exchanged in each chamber by needle/syringe access through designated inset and outlet ports in the bioreactor in the controlled environment of the life sciences glovebox.\n\nThe experiments were initiated in microgravity with the exchange of media into induction media consisting of DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (day 0). The media were exchanged again on day 3. The viability of samples was qualitatively monitored using an on-orbit phase-contrast microscope. Semi-synchronous ground control experiments were performed on a separate set of muscle-on-a-chip bioconstructs from the same donors in identical bioreactors and syringe media exchange procedures. The bioreactors in normal gravity conditions were cultured in conventional incubators but were handled otherwise in the same manner and with the same time stamps, as in microgravity.\n\nDrug Screening in Microgravity\nAs proof of concept for using muscle-on-a-chip bioconstructs for drug screening, two drugs were assessed in microgravity conditions. The first was insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF- 1, 100 ng/ml, Peprotech), which is known to induce proliferation, growth, and regeneration. The second was SW033291 (200 nM, Cayman), a small molecule inhibitor of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH-i) that was previously shown to enhance myogenesis in previous studies. The drugs were diluted in induction media and loaded into syringes for media exchange on days 0 and 3 in separate bioreactors. On day 7, the conditioned media within the bioreactors were harvested at stored at -80C. The muscle-on-a-chip bioconstructs within each chamber were treated with RNA Later stabilization agent at stored at -80C. Upon sample return to Earth about two months later, the bioreactors were processed for RNA Sequencing and proteomics.     On day 7, the conditioned media within the bioreactors were harvested and stored at −80C. The muscle-on-a-chip devices within each chamber were either treated with RNAlater stabilization agent (Fisher Scientific) and then stored at −80C or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Fisher Scientific) for 15 min and then stored at 4C. Samples were maintained on the ISSNL at the indicated temperatures and then returned to Earth on SpaceX Cargo Resupply Service 23 about two months later.     Upon sample return to Earth, the muscle-on-a-chip bioconstructs that had been stabilized in RNA Later were dissociated using TrypLE enzyme (Fisher Scientific) for total RNA and total DNA isolation (All Prep Mini Kit, Qiagen). Total RNA samples showing good RNA integrity by Agilent Bioanalyzer analysis were processed for library preparation and bulk RNA Sequencing by Novogene Corporation. In brief, mRNA was purified from total RNA using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads.     After fragmentation, the first strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primers, followed by the second strand cDNA synthesis. Non-directional library preparation was completed after end repair, A-tailing, adapter ligation, size selection, amplification, and purification. The library was validated using Qubit assay (Fisher Scientific) and quantitative PCR, along with Agilent bioanalyzer analysis of size distribution detection.     The libraries were pooled and sequenced using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S4 platform. The paired-end reads were then generated.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.12.1 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.26. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 13-May-2024.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.2 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.2/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Homo Sapiens STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCh38 (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.112.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Homo Sapiens STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to none and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.19.1).",

          "Study Description": "Microgravity has been shown to lead to both muscle atrophy and impaired muscle regeneration. The purpose was to study the efficacy of microgravity to model impaired muscle regeneration in an engineered muscle platform and then to demonstrate the feasibility of performing drug screening in this model. Engineered human muscle was launched to the International Space Station National Laboratory, where the effect of microgravity exposure for 7 days was examined by transcriptomics and proteomics approaches. Gene set enrichment analysis of engineered muscle cultured in microgravity, compared to normal gravity conditions, highlighted a metabolic shift toward lipid and fatty acid metabolism, along with increased apoptotic gene expression. The addition of pro-regenerative drugs, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and a 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase inhibitor (15-PGDH-i), partially inhibited the effects of microgravity. In summary, microgravity mimics aspects of impaired myogenesis, and the addition of these drugs could partially inhibit the effects induced by microgravity. Only data for myoblast samples are reported here. See OSD-787 for vastus lateralis tissue data.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.     Frozen serum aliquots were shipped to Alamar Biosciences (Fremont, CA).     The NULISA-seq Inflammation Panel was performed, which targets 124 cytokines/chemokines and 80 other proteins related to immune response. NGS data were processed using the NULISAseq algorithm (Alamar Biosciences). The sample- (SMI) and target-specific (TMI) barcodes were quantified, and up to two mismatching bases or one indel and one mismatch were allowed. Intraplate normalization was performed by dividing the target counts for each sample well by that well’s internal control (mCherry) counts. Interplate normalization was performed using interplate control (IPC) normalization, in which counts were divided by target-specific medians of the three IPC wells on that plate, and then rescaled by the factor 10^4. To facilitate statistical analyses, IPC-normalized counts were log2-transformed to form a more normal distribution. These log2 IPC-normalized counts are referred to as NULISA Protein Quantification (NPQ) units. Methods for data processing and normalization were extracted from Feng et al 2023 (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.09.536130v2.full.pdf).     Frozen serum samples were submitted to Eve Technologies (Calgary, Canada) for biomarker profiling.     The biomarker profiling panel Human Cytokine/Chemokine 71-Plex Discovery Assay® Array (HD71) was used. Concentration values were extrapolated using a 4 of 5 parameter logic standard curve. Measurements were normalized by average of pre-flight values from all crew.     Frozen serum samples were submitted to Eve Technologies (Calgary, Canada) for biomarker profiling.     The biomarker profiling panel Human Cardiovascular Disease Panel 3 9-Plex Discovery Assay® Array (HDCVD9) was used.

All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented for data and sample sharing. We analyzed samples before and after a 3-day mission to space.     Serum separator tubes (SSTs, BD Biosciences:  367987) were spun at 1300xg for 10 minutes. Fresh serum was sent at room temperature to Quest Diagnostics for a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). The remaining serum was frozen at -80C.     Fresh serum was submitted to Quest Diagnostics (test code 10231) and run on a Beckman Coulter AU5800.",

          "Study Description": "The SpaceX Inspiration4 mission was a 3-day mission with four private astronauts to low Earth orbit that occurred in September 2021. The crew collected biospecimen samples before, during, and after flight. One of these biospecimen collections included whole blood collected via venipuncture, with serum extracted from blood using a serum separator tube (SST). Samples were collected pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3) and post-flight (R+1, R+45, R+82). Serum samples were submitted for immune and cardiovascular cytokine biomarker profiling panels at two different companies (Eve Technologies and Alamar), and to Quest Diagnostics for comprehensive metabolic panel testing. Data was used to measure changes in cytokines and metabolic measures during spaceflight. This study derives results from the Comprehensive Metabolic Panel and Multiplex assays, and the blood serum data in this study are related to other studies using data from the same experiment; OSD-569 (whole blood), OSD-570 (peripheral blood mononuclear cells), OSD-571 (plasma), OSD-572 (skin, oral, and nasal swabs),  OSD-573 (Dragon capsule samples), OSD-574 (skin biopsy), OSD-656 (urine), and OSD-630 (stool).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "cfDNA was extracted using Qiagen’s QIAamp ccfDNA/RNA Kit per manufacturer’s instructions and eluted in 15 uL Qiagen Elution Buffer per sample.     Entire extract volume was used as input for library preparation using NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Preparation Kit for cfDNA protocol, which skips the fragmentation step. Each sample was barcoded using NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (Unique Dual Index UMI Adaptors - 96 reactions) per manufacturer’s instructions. Final library was eluted in 30uL and checked for concentration using Thermo Fisher Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay (cat  Q33231). 0.25 pmol of each sample was then shipped to Element Biosciences for sequencing. Each library was circularized individually with an input range of 0.2-0.5 pmol (30 ul of 6.67-16.67nM) based on linear library yields using Adept Library Compatibility Kit (Element Biosciences, Cat  830-00003).     Circular libraries were pooled into 2 separate 4-plex pools. Each 4-plex pool was denatured and sequenced on Element AVITI system (Element Biosciences, Part  88-00001) using 2x147 paired reads with 19bp UMI/index 1 and 8 bp index 2. Primary analysis was performed onboard the AVITI sequencing instrument.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.     Plasma samples were thawed on ice and EVPs were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation, as previously described. Briefly, samples were centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 20 minutes to remove microvesicles, then EVPs were collected by ultracentrifugation in a Beckman Coulter Optima XE or XPE ultracentrifuge at 100,000 x g for 70 minutes. EVPs were then washed in PBS and pelleted again by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g for 70 minutes. The final EVP pellet was resuspended in PBS.     EVP samples were dried by vacuum centrifugation and re-dissolved in 30-50 µL 8M Urea/50 mM am​​monium bicarbonate/10 mM DTT. Following lysis and reduction, proteins were alkylated using 20 or 30 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma). Proteins were digested with Endopeptidase Lys C (Wako) in less than 4M urea followed by trypsinization (Promega) in less than 2M Urea. Peptides were desalted and concentrated using Empore C18-based solid phase extraction prior to analysis by high resolution/high mass accuracy reversed phase (C18) nano-LC-MS/MS. Typically, 30% of each sample was injected. Peptides were separated on a pulled-emitter column using a 90-minute gradient increasing from 2 to 30% buffer B/buffer A (buffer A: 0.1% formic acid in water, buffer B: 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile). Samples were analyzed on Q-Exactive HF LC-MS/MS instrument (Thermo Scientific) operated in data dependent (DDA) positive ion mode.     High resolution/high mass accuracy nano-LC-MS/MS data was processed using Proteome Discoverer 1.4.1.14 (Thermo-Scientific, 2012)/ Mascot 2.5, as previously reported25. Human data was queried against the UniProt’s Complete HUMAN proteome (February, 2020: 74,790 sequences) using the following parameters: Enzyme: Trypsin/P, maximum allowed missed cleavage sites: 2, monoisotopic precursor mass tolerance: 10 ppm, monoisotopic fragment mass tolerance: 0.02 Da, dynamic modifications: Oxidation (M), Acetyl (Protein N-term), static modification: Carbamidomethyl (C). Percolator was used to calculate peptide False Discovery Rates (FDR), which was calculated per file. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% was applied to each separate LC-MS/MS file. For plasma, the sequences of porcine trypsin and Endopeptidase LysC were concatenated to the human databases. After processing, the “limma” R package (version 3.52) was used, taking into account estimated sample weights and including astronaut as a factor in the model.     cfRNA was extracted using Norgen's Plasma/Serum Circulating and Exosomal RNA Purification Kits (Slurry Format). Extracted RNA was DNase treated with 14 mL of 10 mL DNase Turbo Buffer (AM2238, Invitrogen), 3 mL DNase Turbo (AM2238, Invitrogen), 1mL Baseline Zero DNase (DB0715K, Lucigen-Epicenter) for 30 min at 37\u0014C and then concentrated into 12 mL using the Zymo RNA Clean and Concentrate Kit (R1015, Zymo).     Sequencing libraries were constructed from 8 mL of concentrated RNA using the Takara SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v3 – Pico Input Mammalian (634485, Takara). Briefly, extracted RNA was reverse transcribed using random priming, barcoded using the SMARTer RNA Unique Dual Index Kit (634451, Takara), rRNA depleted, and further amplified. Final library was eluted in 20uL and concentration was quantified using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Q33216, Invitrogen) with the dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Q32854, Invitrogen).     Libraries were pooled to equal concentration and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 2K P3 using 2x61 paired reads.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.     250 µL of each sample was transferred to Seer Sample Tubes for processing with the Proteograph Assay kit (S55R1100). Plasma proteins were quantitatively captured in nanoparticle (NP) associated protein coronas. To this end, 5 distinctly functionalized NP comprising superparamagnetic cores were employed. At equilibrium, NPs synergistically captured physicochemical subsets of the proteome and efficiently compress the high dynamic range of protein abundances to an accessible scale. The superparamagnetic core facilitates a fully automated liquid handling process. Proteins were subsequently denatured, reduced, alkylated and subjected to proteolytic digestion (trypsin and Lysc). Peptides were purified and yields were determined (Thermo Fisher Scientific catalog   23290). Peptides were dried down overnight with a vacuum concentrator and reconstituted with a reconstitution buffer to a concentration of 25 or 50 ng/µL, depending on nanoparticle (NP) peptide preparation.     For Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA), 4 µL of reconstituted peptide mixture from each NP preparation was analyzed resulting in a constant mass MS injection between samples (200 ng: NP1, NP2, NP3, and NP5; 100 ng: NP4). Each sample was analyzed with an UltiMate3000 nanoLC system coupled with a Bruker timsTOF Pro mass spectrometer using a trap-and-elute configuration. First, the peptides were loaded onto an Acclaim PepMap 100 C18 (0.3 mm ID x 5 mm) trap column and then separated on a 50 cm µPACTM analytical column (PharmaFluidics, Belgium) at a flow rate of 1 µL/min using a gradient of 5 – 25% solvent B (0.1% formic acid, 100 % acetonitrile) mixed into solvent A (0.1% formic acid, 100% water) over 22 min, resulting in a 33 min total run time. The mass spectrometer was operated in diaPASEF mode using ion mobility range of 0.57 – 1.47 V*s/cm2, TIMS Ramp of 100 ms and 100 ms TIMS accumulation time. Scan ranges were 100-1700 m/z (MS1) and 400-1000 m/z (MS2). One-hundred fixed window MS2 DIA scans were collected per cycle.     DIA data was processed using ProteographTM Analysis Suite (PAS). Raw MS data was processed using the DIA-NN search engine (version 1.8), searching MS/MS spectra against human protein entries (UP000005640_9606) and a human plasma spectral library generated from DDA runs (62,687 precursors and 4,011 protein groups). MS1 and MS2 mass accuracy was set to 10 ppm. Precursor FDR was set to 0.01, and PG Q value was set to 0.01. Quantiﬁcation was performed on summed abundances of all unique peptides considering only precursors passing the q-value cutoff. PAS summarizes all nanoparticle values for a single protein into a single quantitative value. Specifically, a single protein may have been measured up to five times, once for each nanoparticle. To derive the single measurement value, PAS uses a maximum representation approach, whereby the single quantification value for a particular peptide or protein group represents the quantitation value of the NP most frequently measured across all samples. Technical duplicates (2 per sample) were first averaged and the average was used for downstream analysis. Protein groups were filtered by coefficient of variance (CV), keeping only proteins with CV less than 0.5 in at least one time point and by data sparsity, keeping proteins that have no NAs in with at least one condition. The filtered data was normalized with “vsn” normalization and imputed with random draws from a Gaussian distribution centered around a minimal value. Differential gene expression analysis was performed with “limma” R package (version 3.52), taking into account estimated sample weights and including astronaut as a factor in the model.     All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented for data and sample sharing. We sequenced analyzed samples before and after a 3-day mission to space.     For proteomics of blood plasma: Venous whole blood was collected into cell processing tubes (CPTs) (BD Biosciences:  362753). CPTs were spun at 1800 x g for 30 minutes. Plasma was aliquoted and frozen at -80C. For proteomics of blood extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) and blood plasma metabolome: Venous whole blood was collected into K2 EDTA tubes (BD Biosciences:  367844).  Blood was centrifuged at 500 x g for 10 minutes, then plasma was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 3000 x g for 20 minutes, and the supernatant was collected and stored at -80C. For cfDNA and cfRNA sequencing: Venous whole blood was collected into cell-free DNA blood collection tubes (cfDNA BCTs) (Streck:  230470). Tubes were spun at 300 x g for 20 minutes. Plasma was transferred to a fresh tube and centrifuged at 5000 x g for 10 minutes. Plasma was aliquoted and frozen at -80C.     To survey a broad range of potential changes in plasma metabolite levels, acquired plasma were extracted for LC/MS-based metabolite profiling using  a combination of aqueous normal phase (ANP)  and reverse phase (RP) chromatographic separations, followed by positive- and negative-ion MS analysis. For ANP LC/MS metabolite profiling, plasma metabolites were extracted by addition of 1 parts of plasma to 20 parts 70% acetonitrile in ddH2O (vol:vol).  The mixture was briefly vortexed and then centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 x g to pellet precipitated matter. The resulting supernatant was transferred to sample vials and 4 µl was injected for ANP LC/MS metabolite profiling. For RP LC/MS metabolite profiling, extraction of plasma was carried out using -70°C cold methanol, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), and water. For this purpose, 8 µL of plasma was added to 180 µL of the cold methanolic extraction media in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and briefly vortexed. This was followed by addition of 600µL ice-cold MTBE to the tube, with intermittent vortex and shaking on ice for 6 min. Phase separation was induced by adding 150 µl of LC-MS-grade H2O to the methanol/MTBE extracts. The final mixture was vortexed again, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 2 min at 4°C. The upper phase was transferred to clean tubes, dried down and stored at -80°C until the day of analysis. On the day of LC/MS analysis, dried down metabolites were resolubilized in 100 µl of a solution consisting of 36% acetonitrile, 36% isopropyl alcohol, 28% H2O, 0.1% formic acid, and 5 mM ammonium formate (i.e., 3:2 volume ratio of LC mobile phases A and B). The resulting reconstitute was briefly vortexed and centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 rpm. Supernatants were transferred to LC sample vials and a 4 µl volume was injected for RP LC/MS analysis using both positive and negative ion MS detection modes as detailed below.     LC/MS analysis of sample extracts was performed using a platform comprised of an Agilent Model 1290 liquid chromatography system coupled to an Agilent 6550 iFunnel time-of-flight MS analyzer28–30. Chromatographic separation of metabolites was performed using both ANP and RP gradient separations, as noted above. For ANP chromatography, plasma metabolites were separated on a Diamond Hydride column (4 µm, 100A, 150 mm X 21 mm ID; MicroSolv Technology Corp.). Mobile phases consisted of: (A) 50% isopropanol, containing 0.025% acetic acid, and (B) 90% acetonitrile containing 5 mM ammonium acetate. To eliminate the interference of metal ions on chromatographic peak integrity and electrospray ionization, EDTA was added to the mobile phase at a final concentration of 5 μM. The following gradient was applied: 0–1.0 min, 99% B; 1.0–20.0 min, to 0%B; 20.0 to 29.0, 0% B; 29.1 to 37 min, 99%B. The flow rate was 0.3 ml/min and column temperature was maintained at 25°C.  For RP chromatography, plasma lipids were preferentially separated using an Agilent Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 column( 1.8 µm, 100 × 2.1 mm ID, Agilent Technologies). Mobile phases consisted of: (A) 60:40 (v/v) acetonitrile:water containing 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1 % formic acid, and (B) 90:10 (v/v) isopropanol:acetonitrile containing 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1 % formic acid. The following gradient was applied: 0 min: 15% B; 0–2 min to 30% B, 2–2.5 min to 48% B, 2.5–8.5 min to 72% B, 8.5–11.5 min to 99% B,11.5–12 min to 99% B, 12.1–15 min 15% B. The flow rate was 0.6 ml/min with a column temperature of 60°C. To eliminate potential artifacts owing to LC/MS instrument drift, metabolite instability, and other experimental factors that may contribute to systematic error, the sample run sequence was arranged such that no two consecutively analyzed samples came from either the same patient or were from the same blood sampling date.     Raw LC/MS data were extracted using MassProfinder 8.0 (Agilent Technologies), employing an in-house annotated personal metabolite database comprising 865 metabolites for ANP chromatography and  270 lipid metabolite  RP database curated from the Agilent plasma lipidomic database (https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/applications/application-LCMS-Plasma-Lipid-Analysis-Method-ZORBAX-Jet-Stream-5991-9280EN-agilent.pdf.pdf). Metabolite identities were inferred based on accurate mass and retention time matches of database. Confidence levels for metabolite annotations were indicated on a 1-4 scale, in accord with guidelines from the Lipidomics Standard Initiative (https://lipidomics-standards-initiative.org/). Relative abundance of extracted metabolites in units of ion counts was exported for downstream statistical analysis. Metabolites with over 20% missing values and samples with over 10% missing values were filtered out. We performed probabilistic quotient normalization to correct for sample-wise variation and then log2 scaled the data. To remove outliers, we removed measurements with less than 2.5% two-tailed probability to originate from the same normal distribution as the rest of the measurement values, after applying a Bonferroni-inspired correction factor (division by sample size).  Metabolites with over 20% missing values were filtered again, and missing values were then imputed using a k-nearest-neighbor algorithm. After processing, the “limma” R package (version 3.52) was used, taking into account estimated sample weights and including astronaut as a factor in the model.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Urine aliquots were thawed and processed immediately.     Urine aliquots were thawed and processed with the NULISAseq 200plex v1 Inflammation Panel (Feng et al.) with two technical replicates (10uL each) per sample. This panel includes 203 targets spanning cytokines, chemokines, and other proteins related to immune response. NGS data were processed using the NULISAseq algorithm (Alamar Biosciences). The sample- (SMI) and target-specific (TMI) barcodes were quantified, and up to two mismatching bases or one indel and one mismatch were allowed. Intraplate normalization was performed by dividing the target counts for each sample well by that well’s internal control (mCherry) counts. Interplate normalization was performed using interplate control (IPC) normalization, in which counts were divided by target-specific medians of the three IPC wells on that plate, and then rescaled by the factor 10^4. To facilitate statistical analyses, IPC-normalized counts were log2-transformed to form a more normal distribution. These log2 IPC-normalized counts are referred to as NULISA Protein Quantification (NPQ) units. Methods for data processing and normalization were extracted from Feng et al 2023 (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.09.536130v2.full.pdf).     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.     All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented for data and sample sharing. We analyzed samples before and after a 3-day mission to space.     Urine was collected from the Inspiration4 crew into sterile collection cups. Samples were aliquoted in a sterile hood and frozen at -80C. Aliquots were shipped to Alamar Bio (Fremont, CA) for biomarker profiling.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented for data and sample sharing. We analyzed samples before and after a 3-day mission to space.     For long-read RNAseq and bulkRNAseq, 2.5 mL of whole blood was collected in PAXgene Blood RNA tubes (BD Biosciences, cat no. 762165). Tube was gently inverted 8-10 times. Tube was stored upright for a minimum of 2 hours, then was placed at -20°C until nucleic acid extraction. For whole genome sequencing and panel clonal hematopoiesis assay, 10mL of whole blood was collected into a Streck cfDNA blood collection tube (cat  230470). Tube centrifuged for 20min at 300g. The red blood cell (RBC) pellet was frozen at -80C. For Complete Blood Count (CBC), one 4mL tube of whole blood was collected in a K2 EDTA tube (BD Biosciences, cat  367844) and submitted to Quest Diagnostics ( test code 6399) for processing.     Total RNA was extracted using the PAXgene Blood RNA kit (Qiagen, cat no. Qiagen 762164) according to the manufacturer's protocol.     Poly-A mRNA was isolated from approximately 50-500 ng of total RNA using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs). The resulting mRNA was converted into cDNA using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs). After end repair/dA-tailing, adaptor ligation, and USER-enzyme digestion, indexing PCR was carried out using the UG Library Amplification Kit (Ultima Genomics) with custom indexing primers that amplify the TruSeq Read1 and Read 2 sequences, but are appended with Ultima Genomics adapter sequences. After 11 cycles of PCR, amplification products were cleaned up using a 1.0x ratio of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). Overhang generation was carried out using components from the UG Library Amplification Kit (Ultima Genomics) and material was size selected using a dsSPRI approach with 0.6x/0.85x AMPure XP beads. Quality control of the resulting libraries was carried out using the DNA High Sensitivity Bioanalyzer Reagents (Agilent Technologies) and concentrations were measured via Qubit HS DNA Quantification Kit (ThermoFisher).     Sample pools were then seeded onto UG sequencing beads, pre-enriched, and amplified by emulsion PCR, leveraging UG’s automated sequencing bead preparation system (AMP). Sequencing was performed on UG100 sequencing systems, running 464 flow-cycles (116 cycles across each of the four nucleotides [T, G, C, A]).     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.     Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ direct RNA library prep protocol (SQK-RNA002) for PromethION was used. Input amount for each sample library preparation was 500 ng of total RNA.     Each library was divided in two, and brought up to loading volume by adding ONT’s EB (Elution Buffer). One PromethION flow cell (FLO-PRO002) was used per library (i.e per sample), and libraries were sequenced on PromethION 48 beta for 72 hours using the MinKNOW software. Runs were paused and the remaining half of each library was reloaded ~18 hours into the sequencing run onto their respective flow cells. Following this, runs were continued for the remainder of 72 hours.     Fast5 files were basecalled with Guppy version 6.2.1 [community.nanoporetech.com], and alignment of raw nanopore events to the basecalled sequences was done with the f5c module eventalign5. Quality assessment was performed with pycoQC and MultiQC. The Oxford Nanopore Technologies pipeline, pipeline-transcriptome-de, was used to quantify transcripts and to subsequently perform the differential expression analysis. pipeline-transcriptome-de performs the quantification with salmon, accounting for multi-mapping reads; therefore, we included the highest-scoring secondary minimap2 alignments (minimap2 switch -p1.0) in the input for the pipeline. Differential gene expression results, which pipeline-transcriptome-de generates with edgeR while collapsing transcripts into respective genes. Differentially expressed genes were also calculated using minimap2, featureCounts, DESeq2, and the SARTools wrapper package. m6Anet was used to detect m6A modifications. As required by m6anet, the transcriptomic alignments were filtered to retain primary mappings only (minimap2 switch --secondary equals no). Sites of m6A modifications were annotated with probabilities of methylation via m6anet, and methylKit was then used to discover differentially methylated sites between conditions; sites were deemed significant if the resultant methylKit q-value fell below 0.01, as recommended by the tool's authors.     One 4mL tube of whole blood collected in a K2EDTA tube (BD Biosciences, Cat. 367844) was submitted to Quest Diagnostics, test code 6399. The Sysmex XN analyzer performs hematology analysis according to the hydrodynamic focusing (DC Detection), flow cytometry method (semiconductor laser), and SLS hemoglobin method.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.     Red blood cell (RBC) pellet was thawed at RT and DNA was extracted with the QIAamp Blood Maxi Kit (Qiagen  51192).     The extracted DNA was shipped to Element Biosciences (San Diego, CA) for library preparation. The extracted DNA was quantified using Thermo Fisher Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (cat  Q238253). KAPA HyperPrep Kit (Roche, cat  07962363001) was used for preparing all extracted DNA samples per manufacturer’s instructions. Adapters used were KAPA Unique-Dual Indexed Adapter Kit (Roche, cat  08861919702). 8 DNA samples were library prepared, Covaris sheared and PCR-free. The DNA libraries were quantified using Thermo Fisher Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (cat  Q238253) and sized using Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit (cat  5067-4626).     The 8 DNA libraries generated with the KAPA HyperPrep Kit were processed using Adept Library Compatibility Kit (Element Biosciences, cat  830-00003). Each library was circularized individually with an input of 0.5pmol (30 ul of 16.67nM). The final circularized libraries were quantified using qPCR standard and primer mix provided in the Adept Compatibility Workflow Kit (cat  830-00007). The 8 circular libraries were pooled into 4 separate 2-plex pools. Each 2-plex pool was denatured and sequenced on Element AVITI system (Element Biosciences, Part  88-00001) using 2x150 paired end reads with indexing.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.     Illumina sequencing adapters containing unique molecular identifiers were ligated onto short-read fragments according to the Kapa Bio-systems HyperPrep protocol (Roche, cat  07962363001). Targeted enrichment of 9 genes (DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, TP53, CHEK2, JAK2, SRSF2, SF3B1, PPM1D) involved in clonal hematopoiesis was performed following the standard Invitae capture protocol.     Deep sequencing was performed to a depth of ~ 15,000x using Novaseq 6000 and 150x150 S4 chemistry.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Depletion of granulocytes was performed either directly from whole blood using the RosetteSep granulocyte depletion cocktail or by cell sorting after PBMC isolation. Whole blood was incubated in a granulocyte depletion cocktail (50 µL/mL of blood) for 20 minutes at room temperature. Next, Ficoll-Paque Plus (Cytiva) was utilized to isolate PBMCs by density gradient centrifugation. After washes in PBS with 2% FBS (GIBCO) were completed, isolated PBMCs were cell sorted to remove granulocytes only if the RosetteSep granulocyte depletion cocktail was not added to whole blood prior to density gradient centrifugation. Granulocytes were identified using side scatter and the lymphocyte and monocyte fractions were sorted using a 100 µm nozzle (BD Aria). Following granulocyte depletion, PBMCs were split into two fractions to generate single cell V(D)J T-cell and B-cell libraries or multi-omic (GEX and ATAC) libraries.     Prior to single cell multiome ATAC and gene expression sequencing, nuclei isolation was performed by resuspending PBMCs in 100 µL of cold lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1 % Tween-20, 0.1 % Nonidet P40, 0.01 % digitonin, 1 % BSA, 1 mM DTT and 1 U/µL RNAse inhibitor. Cells were incubated for 4 minutes on ice, followed by the addition of 1 mL cold wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1 % Tween-20, 1 % BSA, 0.1 % Tween-20, 1 mM DTT, 1 U/µl RNAse inhibitor). After centrifugation (500 RCF for 5 minutes at 4°C), nuclei were resuspended in diluted nuclei buffer (10X Genomics Single Cell Multiome ATAC kit A) at a concentration of 6,000 nuclei per µL.     Single-nuclei libraries were generated via the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC and Gene Expression kit (10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer's instructions.     Samples were sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000. ATAC libraries were sequenced with a 51-8-24-51 configuration.     The resulting single-nuclei GEX and single-nuclei ATAC-seq FASTQ files were aligned using the cellranger-arc pipeline from 10X genomics against human reference genome hg38. Quality control and cell annotation was performed on the snATAC seq peak-cell matrices, and the snGEX gene-cell matrices using the R Seurat package (version 4.2.0). Subpopulations were clustered and labeled using a publicly available Azimuth human PBMCs in conjunction with Seurat’s supervised clustering functionality. Differential gene expression analysis for labeled subpopulations was performed using the FindMarkers functionality of Seurat, with a log fold change (logFC) cutoff point of 0.25. P-values of resultant genes were measured using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test and deemed significant for p less than 0.05. Differentially accessible regions for the labeled subpopulations were identified using the same method.     Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.11) was used to generate MultiQC reports. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.     To capture T-cell and B-cell V(D)J repertoire, single cell gel beads-in-emulsion and libraries were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ v2, 10x Genomics).     Samples were sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000, paired end reads (151x2).     VDJ libraries were processed using Cell Ranger v6.1.1. Reads were aligned to the GRCh38 human genome. TCR and BCR annotated data were analyzed with the VGenes package (https://github.com/WilsonImmunologyLab/VGenes).     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.     Samples were sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000. Gene Expression (GEX) Libraries were sequenced with a 28-10-10-90 configuration.     All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented for data and sample sharing. We sequenced analyzed samples before and after a 3-day mission to space.     For each crew member at each timepoint, 8 mL of venous blood was collected in K2 EDTA anticoagulant tubes  (BD Biosciences:  367844). Samples were processed immediately after collection.",

All crew members have consented for data and sample sharing.     Whole blood was collected from a K2 EDTA tube (BD Biosciences, cat  367844) at the R+194 day time point.     T cells were isolated using the MACSxpress Whole Blood Pan T Cell Isolation Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Miltenyi Biotec,  130-098-193). Red Blood Cell Lysis Solution was used to remove any remaining red blood cells in the cell suspension (Miltenyi Biotec,  130-094-183). Cells were pelleted via centrifuge at 300×g for 10 minutes at room temperature and resuspended in freezing media (DMSO(10%)/FBS(90%) solution). Cells were frozen until the time of the Cut and Run protocol.     Cut and Run libraries for C002 crew member T cells were prepared following the Epicypher Cutana Cut and Run protocol adapted for a 96 well plate format. Reagents and spin columns were obtained from CUTANA ChIC/CUT and RUN kit (SKU: 14-1048). The experiment was tested with both 10,000 cell inputs and 5,000 cell inputs. Cells were washed and bound with activated ConA beads. After magnetic separation, supernatant was removed and antibody buffer solution was added to each sample along with 1:100 dilutions of antibodies for H3K27ac (Abcam: cat  ab245911 and Active Motif: cat  39034), H3K4me1 (Epicypher: cat  13-0040, Active Motif: cat  39635, and Invitrogen: cat  710795), and H3K3me3 (Cutana: cat  13-0041). Cutana Rabbit IgG antibody (cat : 13-0042) was used as a negative control. Samples were incubated overnight at 4°C rotating followed by magnetic separation and washing with 0.01% digitonin buffer. Cutana pAG-MNase were bound to each sample washed again twice with digitonin buffer and chromatin was digested and released with 100 mM CaCl2 and incubated for 2 hrs at 4°C. Stop buffer with 1ng of Cutana E.coli Spike-in DNA (SKU: 18-1401) was added to each sample followed by an incubation at 37°C for 10 mins. 10ul of purified DNA fragments were used for library prep following the NEBNext Ultra II for DNA protocol but with 16 amplification cycles.     Samples were loaded on a Novaseq S4 flow cell and sequenced paired end 151x151 at 40 million reads.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1.

          "Study Protocol Description": "Collected skin was flash embedded in OCT blocks. Three or 4 replicate OCT-embedded tissues were placed on a single slide per patient including pre and post flight replicates.     Immunofluorescent visualization marker for Pan-Cytokeratin (PanCK, Novus cat  NBP2-33200,  Alexa Fluor® 532, clone ID AE1 + AE3), fibroblast activation protein (FAP, Abcam cat  ab222924, Alexa Fluor® 594, clone ID EPR20021) and smooth muscle actin (SMA, R and D Systems cat  IC1420R, Alexa Fluor® 647, clone 1A4) were used for region or interest (ROI) selection. The DSP whole transcriptome assay (WTA) was used to assess genes collected in each ROI. For DSP processing, OCT slides were thawed overnight in 10% NBF at 4°C followed by PBS washes for thorough fixation.  After washes, slides were prepared following the automated Leica Bond RNA Slide Preparation Protocol for fixed frozen samples, digesting samples with 1.0 µg/mL protease K for 15 min, and antigen retrieval for 20 min at 100°C (NanoString, no. MAN-10115-05). In situ hybridizations with the GeoMx Whole Transcriptome Atlas Panel (WTA, v1.0, 18,677 genes) at 4 nM final concentration were done in Buffer R (NanoString). Morphology markers were prepared for four slides concurrently using Syto13 (DNA), PanCK, FAP and SMA in Buffer W for a total volume of 225 μl per slide. Slides incubated with 225 μl of morphology marker solution at RT for 1 h, then washed in SSC and loaded onto the NanoString DSP instrument. The No Template Control was used to detect contamination in the library prep.     Libraries were constructed with Illumina adapters for paired end sequencing.     Libraries were sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer.     Images were captured using the NanoString GeoMx system. The 20x scan was used to select freeform ROIs to guide selection of outer epidermal (OE), inner epidermal (IE), outer dermal (OD) and vascular (VA) regions.     FASTQ files were converted to digital count conversion files using the NanoString GeoMx NGS DnD Pipeline (v2.3.4). From the normalized count matrix, DESeq2 (v1.34.0) was used to perform differential expression analysis.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.     DNA and RNA were extracted with the Qiagen Allprep Bacterial DNA/RNA/Protein Kit (cat  47054).     For library preparation, total RNA samples were sent to Hudson Alpha. Samples were treated with DNAse 1 (Zymo Research, Catalog   E1010). Post-DNAse digested samples were then put into the NEBNext rRNA depletion v2 (Human/Mouse/Rat), Ultra II Directional RNA (10 ng), and Unique Dual Index Primer Pairs were used following the vendor protocols from New England Biolabs. Completed libraries were quantified by Qubit or equivalent and run on a Bioanalyzer or equivalent for size determination. Libraries were pooled and quantified by Qubit fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific), TapeStation 2200 (Agilent), and qRT-PCR using the Kapa Biosystems Illumina library quantification kit.     Libraries were sequenced using 2 x 150 Paired end sequencing on an S4 flow cell using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer.     Utilizing kraken2 v2.1.1, a human genome reference database was constructed from NCBI's RefSeq (GCF_000001405.39) GRCh38.p13, with --no-masking, and defaults of kmer-length 35 and minimizer-length of 31. FASTQ files were screened against this database, and all successfully classified reads were removed.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.     Illumina DNA Library prep kit was used for preparing all extracted DNA samples for Illumina Whole genome sequencing per manufacturer’s instructions. Adapters used were IDT® for Illumina® DNA/RNA UD Indexes, Tagmentation (96 Indexes, 96 Samples).     Libraries were sequenced using 2 x 150 Paired end sequencing on an S4 flow cell using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.     Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.11. Quality-trimming and filtering was performed with bbmap v38.86. Read-based processing was performed with humann v3.6. Individual samples were assembled with megahit v1.2.9. Genes were called with prodigal v2.6.3. Taxonomic classification of genes and contigs was performed with CAT v5.2.2. Functional annotation was done with KOFamScan v1.3.0. Reads were mapped to assemblies with bowtie2 v2.3.5.1, and coverage information was extracted for reads and contigs with samtools v1.9 and bbmap v38.86. Binning of contigs was performed with metabat2 v2.15. Bins were summarized with bit v1.8.53 and estimates of quality were generated with checkm v1.1.3. High-quality bins (greater than 90% est. completeness and less than 10% est. redundancy) were taxonomically classified with gtdb-tk v1.5.0.     All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented for data and sample sharing.     Skin biopsies were performed on the deltoid region of the arm from the L-44 and R+1 timepoint. Each site was prepared by application of ChloraPrep and anesthesia was induced with administration of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine. A trephine punch was used to remove a 3- or 4-mm diameter piece of skin. The resected piece was cut into approximately ⅓ and ⅔ sections. The larger piece was placed in a cryovial and stored at -80°C for spatial transcriptomics. One-third of the sample was stored in formalin and kept at room temperature to perform histology. Skin swabs: Isohelix swabs were dipped in nuclease-free water. Swabs were then stored in 400uL of Zymo Research DNA/RNA Shield (cat 1100).",

One of these biospecimen collections included deltoid skin biopsies, collected once pre-flight (L-44) and within 1 day postflight (R+1). Biopsies were 3mm - 4mm in diameter and were frozen at -80C at the time of collection. Samples were then embedded in OCT and prepared for spatially resolved transcriptomics using the NanoString GeoMx Whole Transcriptome Atlas Panel. Skin was profiled in four regions: outer epidermis (OE), inner epidermis (IE), outer dermis (OD), and vasculature (VA) regions. Four crew members were profiled pre-fight (C001, C002, C003, C004) and three crew members were profiled post-flight (C002, C003,  C004). Additionally, skin swabs of the deltoid region were collected before each biopsy. Skin swabs were first dipped in nuclease-free water before swabbing each region for 30 seconds. Swabs were stored in 400uL of Zymo Research DNA/RNA Shield at 4C until nucleic acid extraction. DNA and RNA were extracted from the same swab to generate metagenomic and metatranscriptomic profiles.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) and smooth muscle cell growth media (SmGM) were purchased from Cell Applications (San Diego, CA). The growth media consists of basal media supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, recombinant insulin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin-like growth factor (R3IGF), ascorbic acid, pen/strep, and amphotericin B, and was used for all pre-flight, flight, and ground-based cultures. HASMC are adherent cells, as such, in all space flight and ground-based cultures the HASMC were seeded onto fibronectin coated (25μg/ml) cytodex-1 microcarrier beads (1mg/ml) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at a density of 10 cells/microcarrier bead in an ultra-low attachment plate (Corning, Corning, NY), and allowed to attach overnight at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified chamber. Cells were cultured on microcarrier beads an additional three days in normal gravity to allow for proliferation and acclimation to the beads prior to loading into the flight hardware cell culture chambers. Prior to loading the HASMCs into the KEU-RO cell culture chambers, media was changed to fresh SmGM.     The Bioscience-3 flight hardware set consisted of 6 KAB controller interface containers (KIC), each housing one Kayser experimental unit (KEU-RO) developed by Kayser Italia (Livorno, Italy). Each KEU-RO was constructed from a biologically compatible plastic, polyetheretherketone (PEEK) consisting of two culture chamber housings (CCH). Each CCH contains two separate cell culture chambers with two separate independent fluid systems that function via a piston system to deliver SmGM- 2 or RNAlater fixative (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) allowing each complete KEU-RO assembly to hold four separate experimental samples. Three KEU-RO cell culture chambers housing three populations of smooth muscle cells were sent to space. Once aboard the International Space Station (ISS), the KEU-RO were inserted into the Space Technology and Advanced Research Systems (STaARS) incubator where temperature was actively maintained at 37°C. The three chambers were cultured in microgravity for three days, including both the time in orbit and installation in the International Space Station (ISS). The KEU-RO are capable of automated media addition to the cell culture chambers as well as the addition of RNAlater fixative at the experimental end point on a pre-defined timeline. Once fixed, the KICs containing the KEU-RO were moved and maintained at -80°C until return to Earth. The ground control experiments were also conducted in the KEU-RO hardware units and were manually activated for media refresh and cell fixation using the same experimental protocol and temperature conditions as the space flight samples. SpaceX CRS-17 was a Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) mission to the ISS. The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket was launched along with the Dragon capsule from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, USA. The CRS-17 delivered more than 5,500 pounds of research, supplies, equipment, and hardware to the ISS, including the KEU-RO containing human HASMCs. Approximately 48 hours after launch, the dragon capsule was docked to the ISS, and approximately 24 hours later, the KEU-RO were installed in the STaARS-1 incubator space for active temperature control at 37°C. While in flight to the ISS and in orbit prior to dock with the ISS, the KEU-RO temperatures were passively maintained and monitored in real-time. During ascent the temperatures held steady at 37°C±0.5°C until installation on board the ISS. Once installed in STaARS-1 incubator space aboard the ISS, the hardware temperature was maintained at 37°C±1°C. The samples from our study spent a total of 3 days in microgravity before being stored frozen, and a total of ~30 days aboard the International Space Station before return to earth.     At 3 days in space, the units were fixed by automated injection of 900 μL RNAlater directly into the cell culture housing chambers (CCH), and transferred to -80C within 90 minutes of fixation.     Upon return to earth, KIC units were thawed on ice and samples extracted from each KEU-RO. Total RNA was extracted from the SMCs preserved in RNAlater with the RNeasy RNA Extraction kit (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD, USA) in conjunction with QIAshredders columns (QIAGEN). Samples were DNase treated (Turbo DNase, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and quantitated with Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA assay (Invitrogen). Total RNA quality was assessed using a Fragment Analyzer.     Poly(A) selected cDNA libraries were prepared (NEBNext UltraII Directional RNA Library Prep kit, NEB, Ipswich, MA), following manufacturers recommendations. SMC libraries were constructed by using 100 ng total RNA.     Sequencing was performed on the NextSeq500 Illumina platform.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.4/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Homo sapiens STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCh38 (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.107.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Homo sapiens STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Description": "The cardiovascular system is strongly impacted by the hazards of spaceflight. Astronauts spending steadily increasing lengths of time in microgravity are subject to cardiovascular deconditioning resulting in loss of vascular tone, reduced total blood volume, and diminished cardiac output. Appreciating the mechanisms by which the cells of the vasculature are altered during spaceflight will be integral to understanding and combating these deleterious effects as the human presence in space advances. In this study, we performed RNA-Seq analysis coupled with review by QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software on human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) cultured for 3 days in microgravity and aboard the International Space Station to assess the transcriptomic changes that occur during spaceflight. The results of our RNA-Seq analysis show that SMCs undergo a wide range of transcriptional alteration while in space, significantly affecting 4,422 genes. SMCs largely down-regulate markers of the contractile, synthetic, and osteogenic phenotypes including smooth muscle alpha actin (αSMA), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs). Additionally, components of several cellular signaling pathways were strongly impacted including the STAT3, NFκB, PI3K/AKT, HIF1α, and Endothelin pathways. This study highlights the significant changes in transcriptional behavior SMCs exhibit during spaceflight and puts these changes in context to better understand vascular function in space.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Vastus lateralis biopsies were obtained from volunteers, phenotyped by age and physical activity at the Translational Research Institute at AdventHealth, Orlando. All participants provided written informed consent, and the study protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board at AdventHealth, Orlando (IRBNet  554559). Cells were received at the University of Florida through a signed Material Transfer Agreement. The active group engaged in structured exercise at least 3 times per week and the sedentary group exercised one or less times per week. Satellite cells from individual donors were isolated, pre-plated to remove fibroblasts and pooled in equal ratios to generate a mean cell stock of young, active cohort (YA; 21–40 years, male, n equals 5) and old, sedentary cohort (OS, 65–80 years, male, n  equals  5) prior to cryopreservation and shipment to the University of Florida through a Material Transfer Agreement and in the absence of any patient identifiable information. Muscle myoblasts were thawed and then cultured on T75 flasks coated with collagen I in Skeletal Muscle Growth medium (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany) to confluence. Immunopurification of mononuclear myoblasts was performed using mouse monoclonal 5.1H11 anti-CD56 antibody (DSHB Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA). CD56+ myoblasts were confirmed by FACS as described.     Pre-Flight Treatment:\nCustom microfluidic chips made from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and containing two platinum 22-gauge electrode leads were obtained from Micro-gRx, INC, (Orlando, FL), sterilized in ethanol and autoclaved at 150 C for 30 min prior to use. Cell seeding was performed at NASA’s Kennedy Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF) for flight and at the University of Florida laboratory for the ground test. Injectable hydrogel mixtures (3.3 mg/mL rat tail collagen I, and 22% (v/v) Matrigel) were combined with the 5-donor pooled YA- or the 5-donor pooled OS-derived CD56+ enriched myoblasts. The cell-laden hydrogels were injected into the PDMS chips to a final cell density of 15 and 20 million cells/mL for pooled YA- and pooled OS-derived cells, respectively. Cells were allowed to polymerize at 37 °C for 60 min and seeding ports were sealed using polylactic acid (PLA, Makerbot, Brooklyn, NY) plugs. Chips were perfused with degassed Skeletal Muscle Growth media supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml Primocin (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 using programmable syringe pumps (Cole Palmer, Vernon Hills, IL). After 48 h, the culturing medium was changed to degassed differentiation media I (MEM-a, 0.5% (v/v) ITS, 2%(v/v) B27,10 uM DAPT, 1 uM Dabrafenib, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.3 and, 0.1 mg/mL Primocin) and delivered at an intermittent rate of 125 ul min−1 for 1 min every 8 h for 6 days before integrating the chips for flight or ground studies.\n\nFor spaceflight tissues, the sterile CubeLab fluidic system was flushed with sterile Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) followed by priming with degassed differentiation media II (MEM-a, 0.5% (v/v) ITS, 2%(v/v) B27, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.3 and, 0.1 mg ml-1 Primocin). PBS effluent was collected, plated, and incubated at 37 °C for 5 days followed by RT (20–25 °C) for 5 days (sterile PBS was plated as control). No colonies were present confirming sterility of the fluidic system. 48 h prior to launch (L-2), tissue chips were exchanged with 1 ml media, disconnected from the syringe pump, inspected under a 10x microscope and 16 chips were integrated into a custom designed 9U CubeLab (Space Tango, Lexington KY). Of the 16 chips, there were eight chip replicates of the YA mean cohort and eight chip replicates of the OS mean cohort (8x YA and 8x OS). On L-3, flight chips were secured PDMS-side down onto fluid connection ports which allowed for fluid-tight mating to the manifold chip posts via press fit connections. A low pulsatile annular gear pump and Takasago-modified valves, controlled fluid to each chip. Two thermoelectric coolers located on the opposite side of the chips ensured consistent temperature (37–39 °C). The stimulation circuit was connected to eight chip’s stimulation leads via blue wire and connectors custom to the stimulation board mounted on one side of the manifold. 200 ml of chilled, degassed media II was added to the source bag and placed into the cold flask (4–8 °C). Chilled RNALater (20 ml) was added to a second source bag and placed into the cold flask (4–8 °C). Fluid from each chip (200 ml) was routed to general waste. The payload was sealed, purged with 5% CO2 using an air gas canister and the thermal protocol was initiated to bring the manifold to 37 °C. Prior to handover, a leak test was performed to verify pressure integrity and the CubeLab was integrated into the powered accent utility locker (PAUL). Once in the PAUL, the camera system was initiated and calibrated for each chip position and the Media Exchange-Waste sequence I (outlined below) was initiated prior to handover to NASA at L-1.\n\nFlight Treatment:\nOn-orbit payload operation  After docking (L + 2), the CubeLab was installed by crew members and operated from within the PAUL. After install, the following protocols were initiated: (1) The Media Exchange-Waste sequence 2. During this event, media was flowed to each chip every 8 h at 125 ul per  min for 1 min and output volume was sent to general waste. (2) The Z-Stack event. During this event, the microscope (10x magnification) was moved to chip N and captured six phase contrast slices at 12 um increments at each chip’s pre-defined position immediately before and after each Media-Exchange-Waste event. (3) The Stimulation and Video event was initiated on L + 9. During this event, 8 chips (4x YA and 4x OS) were electrically stimulated. The remaining 8 chips (4x YA and 4x OS) were non-stimulated. The intended program involved moving the microscope to chip N’s ideal position and recording video at 25 fps for 40 s (pre-stimulation phase), then at the 41 s mark after video initiation, a stimulation waveform (3 V, 2 Hz, 2msec) on chip N was elicited and video was to be recorded for an additional 40 s (stimulation phase). Finally, at the 82 s mark after video initiation, the stimulation waveform ceased, and video was to be recorded for 40 s (recovery phase) for total of 120 s of video for each of the 8 chips. The program was to be repeated every 24 h for 5 days. The executed program included stimulation of the 8 chips for 30 min on one day prior to initiation of fixation.  Asynchronous ground experiment  The ground experiment was performed at the University of Florida approximately 30 days following the return and de-integration of the flight study. Aliquots from the same lot of pooled YA and pooled OS cells (8x YA and 8x OS) used for flight were used for the ground study and the 16 tissue chips were seeded and differentiated as described in the Preparation of Bioengineered Myobundles (Flight and Ground) section. On the equivalent of day “L-3”, ground chips remained connected to the syringe pumps in the cell incubator (37 °C and 5% CO2) and differentiation media I in 3 ml syringes were changed to degassed differentiation media II and delivered to the ground chips every 8 h at 125 ul per  min for 1 min to mimic the integration of the flight chips into the CubeLab and the switch from media I to II. On the equivalent day as “L + 9”, 8 chips (4x YA and 4x OS) were electrically stimulated with wave form 3 V, 2 Hz, 2msec for 30 min using a custom microcontroller and circuit board as described1. No video was collected as we did not have the capability to record inside the incubator. The remaining 8 chips (4x YA and 4x OS) were non-stimulated.  On-orbit payload operation  The Fixation event. During this event, RNALater was initiated to each chip at 125  ul per  min for 5 min at termination of the experiment. Crew members removed the CubeLab from the PAUL and transferred to the ICEBERG cold stowage asset, at −35 °C. Continuous telemetry from the CubeLab environment was recorded in the customer dashboard portal. Z-stacked images of each chip per day and the stimulation video were downlinked to the portal system. An open-source digital image correlation (DIC) algorithm based in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA) was used to quantify displacements at the region of interest in the tissue chip as previously described.\n\nAsynchronous ground experiment:\nOn the equivalent day as “L + 10”, the tissue chips were disconnected from the syringe pump and 1 ml of RNALater was manually added to the chips to mimic flight samples and stored at −20 °C for more than 24 h.     On-orbit payload operation:  The Fixation event. During this event, RNALater was initiated to each chip at 125  ul per  min for 5 min at termination of the experiment. Crew members removed the CubeLab from the PAUL and transferred to the ICEBERG cold stowage asset, at −35 °C.

Payload splashdown from SpaceX CRS-21 occurred on January 14, 2021, and the CubeLabTM was transferred from a Double Cold Bag (conditioned at −32 °C) to a −80 °C freezer at NASA’s Kennedy SSPF processing laboratory where the CubeLabTM was de- integrated and chips were removed and immediately processed for RNA isolation. Flight chips in RNALater were lysed in RLT buffer (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) prepared with B-mercaptoethanol.  Asynchronous ground experiment:  On the equivalent day as “L + 10”, the tissue chips were disconnected from the syringe pump and 1 ml of RNALater was manually added to the chips to mimic flight samples and stored at −20 °C for more than 24 h.     Post-flight RNA extraction  Payload splashdown from SpaceX CRS-21 occurred on January 14, 2021, and the CubeLab was transferred from a Double Cold Bag (conditioned at −32 °C) to a −80 °C freezer at NASA’s Kennedy SSPF processing laboratory where the CubeLab was de-integrated and chips were removed and immediately processed for RNA isolation. Flight chips in RNALater were lysed in RLT buffer (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) prepared with B-mercaptoethanol. RNA isolation was then performed using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions. The integrity of the extracted RNA was assessed by Agilent 2200 Tapestation system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Only the non-stimulated samples were compared and reported in this communication.     RNA sequencing analysis  Libraries of extracted RNA samples were built using the NEBNext® Ultra™ Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, USA) RNA sample preparation kit and yielded fragments with 220–700 base pairs.     The qualified fragments were ligated with 60 adapters, amplified, and submitted for sequencing by Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) to generate paired end reads with a length of 150 bases.     The input sequences were trimmed using trimmomatic. Quality control was performed before and after trimming using FastQC (v 0.11.4) and MultiQC and a total of 50 million reads were generated for each sample yielding coverage in the range of 118 to 220 bases for each sample, Then the input sequences were aligned to the transcriptome using the STAR aligner, version 2.7.9a. Transcript abundance was quantified using RSEM (RSEM v1.3.1), and genes with insufficient average counts were excluded from further statistical analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2 package, with an FDR-corrected P-value threshold of 0.05. The results were further filtered to extract transcripts showing a 2.0-fold change (log2FC) in either direction.  Differential expression and functional annotation analysis of RNA-seq data  Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from YA- and OS flight samples were normalized to the matching ground control group and reported as log2 of the fold change (log2FC). Fold induction values were averaged for all experiments performed as experimental triplicates for each cohort. RNA-seq data were analyzed by iPathwayGuide (Advaita Bioinformatics: http://www.advaitabio.com/ipathwayguide.html) by identifying significantly impacted signaling pathways. Volcano plots, which rely on double filtering criterion and display unstandardized signal log2FC against noise-adjusted/standardized signal FDR-corrected P-value, were used to display up- and down-regulated DEGs. Gene Ontology (GO) and Pathway enrichment analysis were performed by comparing DEGs with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases where p  less than 0.05 was statistically significant. Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery database (DAVID, https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) was used to determine the biological meaning to a given set of DEGs and categorized them by GO-molecular function, GO-biological process, and GO-cellular component. In DAVID database, Fisher’s Exact test is adopted to measure the gene-enrichment in annotation terms. Fisher’s Exact p-values are computed by summing probabilities p over defined sets of tables (Prob  equals  ∑Ap) and looks for any functional enrichment against a background that consist of all Homo Sapiens genes. Each GO term is used to describe the features of genes and gene products. For each Gene Ontology (GO) term, the number of DEGs annotated to the term is compared against the number of genes expected by chance. Significance of each GO term was assessed using the default homo sapiens GO annotation as background. A GO term was considered statistically significant at FDR-corrected P  less than or equal to  0.05. IPathwayGuide uses an overrepresentation test, based on a hypergeometric distribution, to compute the statistical significance of observing more than the expected number of DEGs. Significance of GO terms were assessed using the default Homo Sapiens GO annotation as background. A GO term was considered statistically significant at FDR-corrected P  less than or equal to  0.05. Next, Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER v.13.0, www.pantherdb.org) Classification System was used to perform protein-encoding genes functional classification and provide information about protein families. PANTHER uses an overrepresentation test, FDR-corrected P  less than or equal to  0.05. The analysis was applied only to DEGs with cut-off of adjusted p-value of 0.05 and fold-change  greater than or equal to  ±2.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.4/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Homo sapiens STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCh38 (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.107.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Homo sapiens STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Description": "Microphysiological systems provide the opportunity to model accelerated changes at the human tissue level in the extreme space environment. Spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy experienced by astronauts shares similar physiological changes to muscle wasting in older adults, known as sarcopenia. These shared attributes provide a rationale for investigating molecular changes in muscle cells exposed to spaceflight that may mimic the underlying pathophysiology of sarcopenia. We report the results from three-dimensional myobundles derived from muscle biopsies from young and older adults, integrated into an autonomous CubeLab™, and flown to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard SpaceX CRS-21 as part of the NIH/NASA funded Tissue Chips in Space program. Global transcriptomic RNA-Seq analyses comparing the myobundles in space and on the ground revealed downregulation of shared transcripts related to myoblast proliferation and muscle differentiation. The analyses also revealed downregulated differentially expressed gene pathways related to muscle metabolism unique to myobundles derived from the older cohort exposed to the space environment compared to ground controls. Gene classes related to inflammatory pathways were downregulated in flight samples cultured from the younger cohort compared to ground controls. Our muscle tissue chip platform provides an approach to studying the cell autonomous effects of spaceflight on muscle cell biology that may not be appreciated on the whole organ or organism level and sets the stage for continued data collection from muscle tissue chip experimentation in microgravity. We also report on the challenges and opportunities for conducting autonomous tissue-on-chip CubeLab™ payloads on the ISS.",

Plasma sample aliquots (120 μl) were thawed on ice, centrifuged at 2,000 g for 10 min at 4°C to remove cellular debris, and 100 μl supernatants were transferred into fresh tubes with 1 ml TRIzol-LS (Life Technologies, cat. no. 10296028). 200 μl chloroform was added to the TRIzol sample, vortex mixed, and spun at 16,000 g for 15 min at 4°C. Supernatants were transferred into fresh tubes with 1 μl glycogen (10 mg/ml stock, Roche, cat. no. 1091393001). 500 μl isopropanol was added, mixed, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. RNA pellets were recovered following centrifugation at 16,000 g for 15 min and the removal of supernatants. Pellets were washed twice with 80% ethanol. RNA was resuspended in 8 μl of water. RNA concentrations were measured using the Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen, cat. no. Q32852).     Each sequencing library preparation used 2.5 μl of purified RNA. For the human plasma RNA and CD36-enriched RNA fractions, the SMART-seq Stranded Kit (Takara Bio, cat. no. 634443) was used at a half-volume scale following the user manual. The template amount was verified before the second PCR step by performing real-time PCR with the Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 4385612) on a 1 μl aliquot of library reaction in order to adjust the PCR cycle for library amplification. PCR products were purified and eluted in 16 μl of Stranded Elution Buffer diluted with water at a 1:1 ratio.     2 x 36 base paired-end sequencing with NextSeq500 (Illumina) were performed.     Reads in FASTQ files were imported into CLC Genomics Workbench (CLC-GW, ver.10.1.1, Qiagen), mapped to human (hg19) reference genome, and quantified using a 57,773-gene annotation set (downloaded from the CLC-GW server) to obtain the total count values, which were combined into a table. To obtain normalized expression values, total counts were normalized by the scaling option in CLC-GW (normalization value equals mean, reference equals median mean, trimming 5%). Normalized total count values were log-2 transformed after adding a pseudocount of unity. RNAseq quantifications are provided in .xslx files as mean and standard error mean (SEM) of 6 astronauts. There are 3 sets of files: 3 group indicates pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight. 9 group indicates 3 pre-flight timepoints being considered as one group and all the other individual groups of in-flight and post-flight timepoints. 11 group indicates all timepoints are considered as individual groups including 3 pre-flight timepoints. ANOVAs and Empirical analyses of DGEs were performed in CLC-GW for the 3 group data. Standard error of the mean was calculated by Microsoft Excel. For the 3 group (pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight) comparison, the experiment range for each feature was calculated as the highest value minus the lowest value across all samples in all groups, the experiment difference was calculated as the average feature expression in the group with the highest average value minus the average feature expression in the group with the lowest average value, and the experiment fold change was calculated as the average feature expression in the group with the highest average value divided by the average feature expression in the group with the lowest average value. The experiment range, difference, and fold change was calculated using the original (raw) values, normalized values, or normalized and transformed values as indicated in the column headers of each .xlsx file. Feature filtering criteria are indicated in the .xlsx file names.     The 120 μl plasma aliquot was centrifuged to remove cell debris. The 100 μl supernatant was transferred into a fresh tube and combined with 650 μl of PBS, and 125 μl of the result was kept as input. The rest of the diluted plasma was combined with a diluted anti-CD36 antibody (LEGENDScreen Human PE Kit, BioLegend, cat. no. 700007, lot no. B328253, 6 μl of reconstituted antibody and 130 μl of PBS with 1 x BSA). The mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 1 hr. Then, 20 μl of washed protein G beads combined with the goat anti-IgM antibody was added, and rotated at 4 °C for 1 hr. The supernatant was removed, and beads were washed twice. Next, 1 ml 1 x TRIzol (diluted TRIzol-LS with H2O at 3:1 for 1x concentration) was added to the washed beads. 850 μl TRIzol-LS was added to the input. RNA was purified following the plasma RNA purification protocol.     Reads in FASTQ files were imported into CLC Genomics Workbench (CLC-GW, ver.10.1.1, Qiagen), mapped to human (hg19) reference genome, and quantified using a 57,773-gene annotation set (downloaded from the CLC-GW server) to obtain the total count values, which were combined into a table.

          "Study Description": "A detailed understanding of how the human body responds to spaceflight will be important to develop countermeasures for long-term space exploration. Liquid biopsies offer minimally invasive alternatives to traditional tissue biopsies, while also permitting the extraction of cell-free nucleic acids, which may resolve molecular heterogeneity and extend the multi-omics scope better than standard methods. Full-body molecular profiling using cell-free nucleic acids isolated from liquid biopsies is hence one viable avenue for advancing space healthcare. Here, we perform a liquid biopsy study with six astronauts who resided on the International Space Station (ISS) for more than 120 days, and show that plasma cell-free RNA (cfRNA) can capture longitudinal gene expression responses of internal tissues to the spaceflight environment. Analysis of cfRNA collected before, during, and after spaceflight confirmed previously reported mitochondria dysregulation in space. Screening with 361 cell surface marker antibodies identified an extracellular mitochondria (exMT)-enriched fraction associated with the scavenger receptor CD36. RNA-sequencing analysis of the CD36 fraction revealed various tissue origins, some of which have not been well characterized due to their conventional inaccessibility. We compared our data to plasma cfRNA mouse data from a JAXA mission, in which on-board artificial gravity had been used, and discovered that microgravity induced the observed systemic responses. Our study used minimally invasive approaches to demonstrate exMT release as a conserved process in space and establishes the impact of gravity on Earth as an essential signal for normal homeostasis.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Blood was sampled 10 days before launch (L-10) and 3 days after return (R+3) from 3 astronauts who flew short (up to 14 days) Shuttle missions between 1998 and 2001. All samples were stored at -80°C until use.     Exosomes were isolated from blood plasma samples of 3 astronauts (C1, C2, and C3) at L-10, and R+3 using the ExoQuick Plasma prep and Exosome precipitation kit (Cat   EXOQ5TM, System Biosciences, CA, USA), as previously described. Briefly, thrombin was added to the plasma and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Next, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was incubated with the exosome precipitation solution for 30 minutes at 4 C. Samples were centrifuged for 30 minutes at 1,500 x g at 4 C. Finally, the supernatant was aspirated, and the beige-colored pellet was dissolved in 100 μl of sterile 1x PBS. Total RNA was extracted from astronaut-derived exosomes using blood collected at L-10 and R+3 using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. High-quality RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini spin columns and eluted using molecular-grade water (RNAse/DNAse free). All samples first undergo quality control assessment to ensure successful library preparation and sequencing. RNA sample quality was assessed by NanoDrop and Agilent\n2100 BioAnalyzer. Samples with RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7, OD260/280: 2, and OD260/230 ≥ 2 were used. In addition, RNA degradation and contamination were monitored on 1% agarose gels before RNA-Seq.     RNA quality was assessed using an Agilent TapeStation (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA), and RNA concentration was quantified by Qubit 4.0 spectrophotometer. The library for small RNA sequencing was prepared using the Smarter smRNA-seq kit for Illumina (Takara Bio Inc., USA). The quantity and quality of amplified libraries were evaluated using Qubit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and Agilent TapeStation high sensitivity D1000 Screen Tape.     Small RNA-seq libraries were sequenced using single-end 75 base pairs (SE75) sequencing chemistry on NextSeq 500 instruments following the manufacturer's protocols (Illumina).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "HMEC-1 cells were seeded on Cyclic Olefin Copolymer coverslips, with 2% gelatin coating to improve cell adhesion, in MCDB131 medium supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, hydrocortisone (1 ug/ml), EGF (10 ng/ml), 1 mM sodium bicarbonate, Penicillin (1 U/ml) Streptomycin (1 ug/ml), HEPES (20 mM). Cell cultures were incubated at 37degreeC in 5% CO2, 80% humidity, before insertion into the Experimental Units (EUs). The EUs are able to fulfill under electronic control and without human intervention, a scientific protocol for cell culture and fixing. 20 samples prepared for nucleic acid extraction were fixed with RNA Protect Cell Reagent.     Samples were brought to the Columbus module of the ISS with the Soyuz TMA-18M 44S manned mission on September 2nd, 2015, within the IRISS mission of ESA. At rendezvous, samples were immediately transferred into the KUBIC facility, an incubator with internal centrifuge for artificial gravity. Space microg samples were exposed to environmental microgravity (ug) and named Space_microg samples; Space_1g samples were set inside the centrifuge reproducing 1g. Other samples, concomitantly prepared for ground control, flew back to Pisa with civilian airlines just when the others were flying into space, and were integrated within the KISS facility in the home laboratory. Experiment activation and media exchanges occurred contemporarily in space and on ground.     At the end of the space mission, the samples were fixed in space, sent back to Earth with manned Soyuz TMA-16M 42S on September 12, 2015, retrieved by ESA personnel, brought to the PI laboratory in Pisa and stored at 6C until processed.     Total RNA was extracted with ReliaPrep RNA Cell Miniprep System (Promega, Madison WI, USA). RNA integrity was assessed with agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining/UV light (GenoPlex, VWR, USA), concentration and purity with NanoView Spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA).     The RNA-seq libraries were prepared using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero Library Prep Kit.     The libraries were sequenced with Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform and CASAVA version 1.8.2 was used to perform base calling. The quality of the 2 x 125 bp reads was assessed with FastQC.     Raw reads were aligned using STAR version 2.5.3 to build version hg38 of the human genome defined by GENCODE release 25. Counts for GENCODE basic annotated genes were calculated from the aligned reads using featureCounts function of the Rsubread R package. Normalization was carried out using edgeR R package. After removal of genes encoded on mitochondrial chromosome, raw counts were normalized according to library size to obtain counts per millions (CPM). Only genes with a CPM greater than 1 in at least 2 sample were retained for subsequent analysis. Genome_build: hg38 (GRCh38)     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Homo sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.3 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.3/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Homo sapiens STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCh38 (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.107.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Homo sapiens STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Description": "Microgravity and space radiation (SR) are two highly influential factors affecting humans in space flight. Many health problems reported by astronauts derive from endothelial dysfunction and impaired homeostasis. Here we describe the adaptive response of human, capillary endothelial cells to space. Reference samples on ground and at 1g onboard allowed discrimination between the contribution of microgravity and SR within the combined response to space. Cell softening and reduced motility occurred in space, with loss of actin stress fibers and a greater distribution of microtubules and intermediate filaments in compensation. The frequency of primary cilia also increased. DNA repair mechanisms were indeed activated. Transcriptomics highlighted the opposing effect of microgravity from SR on specific molecular pathways: radiation, unlike microgravity, stimulated pathways for endothelial activation (hypoxia, inflammation), DNA repair and apoptosis, promoting an ageing-like phenotype; microgravity, unlike SR, activated pathways for metabolism and pro-proliferation phenotype. Thus, microgravity and SR should be considered separately to tailor effective countermeasures to protect astronauts’ health. To identify transcriptional changes induced by microgravity, space radiation, and their combination together with other stimuli in space flight, we used a model of human endothelial cells of microvascular origin (HMEC-1). Space samples were exposed to environmental microgravity (g) or set inside the centrifuge reproducing 1g; on ground samples were used as ground control.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "HT-29 cells were seeded into collagen-coated hollow fiber bioreactors at Kennedy Space Center at a concentration of 1x10^6 CFU. Cells were cultured using GTSF-2 medium. Wild Type Salmonella Typhimurium strain χ3339 (an animal-passaged derivative of wild type SL1344) was prepared from overnight cultures in Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS) stasis buffer at a final concentration of ~1x10^7 CFU/mL. Prepared S. Typhimurium was loaded in to gas permeable FEP bags designated for a subset of the bioreactors. The RNA fixative RNAlater II (40 mL) was separately loaded into FEP bags (one per bioreactor). All bioreactors, bacteria bags and fixative bags were integrated into the Cell Culture Module (CCM) flight hardware, which was then sealed, powered and set to 37 °C and 5% CO2. The CCM was turned over to the KSC integration team at L-18 hours. STL-IMMUNE launched aboard Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-131) on April 5, 2010 at 6:21 am. At approximately L+3 hours, astronauts activated the on orbit programming of the CCM.     On Mission Elapsed Day 11, a subset of the HT-29 cultures were infected with ~1x10^7 CFU wild type S. Typhimurium (estimated multiplicity of infection/m.o.i. of ~1-10). The remaining cultures served as time-matched uninfected controls. Six hours post-infection, all cultures were fixed in RNAlater II.     RNA was extracted from duplicate samples using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen).  All samples were analyzed in biological duplicate (two separate bioreactors), except for the infected spaceflight sample which was analyzed in technical duplicate from the same bioreactor. Samples were lysed with 700 µl Qiazol (Qiagen), vortexed extensively and passed several times through a 25G needle. After a 5-minute static incubation at room temperature with intermittent vortexing, samples were added to MaXtract High Density tubes (Qiagen) together with 100 µl RNase-free water (Qiagen) and 200 µl chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were then processed (including on-column DNase-treatment) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and the integrity validated using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 to confirm a RIN of 7 or greater for all samples. One of the uninfected ground control samples (CN122) had a RIN of 6.4.     RNA was fragmented with heat and magnesium to roughly 300 bp using the KAPA HyperPrep RNA-seq kit (Roche). The KAPA Hyper RNA-seq kit and Illumina-compatible adapters (IDT) were used for the remaining library construction. Adapter ligated molecules were cleaned using Kapa pure beads (Kapa Biosciences), amplified with Kapa HIFI enzyme. Each library was then analyzed for fragment size on an Agilent’s Tapestation and quantified by qPCR (KAPA Library Quantification Kit) on Quantstudio 5 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).     Libraries were then multiplexed and sequenced on 2x150 flow cell on the NovaSeq platform (Illumina) at University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus Genomics and Microarray Core.     bcl2fastq v2.17.1.14 used for basecalling STAR v2.5.1b used for alignment Cufflinks v2.2.1 was used to report FPKM values (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) and read counts. TPM (Transcripts Per Million) was calculated by an in-house R script. Human: GRCh38.p7 primary assembly; Bacteria: S. Typhimurium LT2 genome     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Homo sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.

          "Study Protocol Description": "This longitudinal study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations from the ethical standards of the appropriate institutional and national committees and with the World Medical Association Helsinki Declaration of 1975 (revised in 2008). The protocol (study name: IMMUNO) for cosmonauts was evaluated by the Russian Ethical Board (Biomedicine Ethics Committee) at the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP), Moscow, and was awarded the protocol number MBI-29. The protocol was also approved by the ESA Medical Board and the Russian Space Agency (Roscosmos). The local Ethical Committee of Ludwig-Maximilian University (LMU), Munich, approved the protocol for the control group (protocol numbers 025/02 and 269-15). All subjects gave written informed consent after being informed of the aim and objectives of the project. Blood samples were collected from five male cosmonauts with a median age of 48 ± 2 (IQR, interquartile range) years (ranging from 39-54 years) who were assigned to a long-term spaceflight mission (ranging from 124 to 186 days) on the ISS. Two of these cosmonauts (COS2 and COS3) took part in the same expedition. Blood collection occurred at six time points. Sample collection on the ground was performed at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center near Moscow or at the DLR training facility in Cologne, Germany, or at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) at NASA, Houston, Texas. Baseline data collection occurred 25 days before flight (L-25, n = 5). Inflight sam- plings occurred after 64 ± 11 (F+64, n = 4) and 129 ± 20 (F+129, n = 3) days spent on the ISS (indicated values are means ± the standard deviation). Postflight sampling occurredondays1(R+1,n=5), 7(R+7,n=5) and 30 (R+30, n = 3) after landing. A control group of four males with a median age of 41 ± 4 (IQR) years (ranging from 36 to 46 years) was selected according to the following criteria: (a) adult, (b) male, (c) age >35 years, (d) no systemic pathology, and (e) not receiving any daily medication. Blood samples were collected from these volunteers at T0 and T+8 months. On-ground-collected blood samples were immediately stored at −80C. Onboard the ISS, blood and saliva samples were stored frozen inside the MELFI freezer at −100C. Frozen samples return to Earth and to the investigators' laboratories was performed according to standard ESA protocols.     Total RNA was extracted from 300 uL of whole blood using the Nucleospin RNA blood kit (Macherey Nagel, Hoerdt, France).     Whole blood RNA was reverse transcribed using random primers, RNaseOUT and MML-V reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France) following the instructions of the LymphoTrack IGH Somatic Hypermutation MiSeq kit (InvivoScribe, San Diego, CA, USA). Then, 2.5 uL of cDNA prepared from each blood sample was mixed with 22.5 uL of IGH master mix provided in the kit (this master mix contains primers, with Illumina adapters, annealing to the leader and joining regions of IgM cDNAs thereby allowing the amplification of IgM cDNA 5'-ends) and 0.1 uL of Taq Gold DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France). These mixtures were subjected to the following cycling protocol: 7 minutes at 95C followed by 35 cycles of 45 seconds at 95C, 45 seconds at 60C, 1 minute 30 seconds at 72C, and finally, 10 minute at 72C. The quantities and sizes of the amplification products were validated using the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA assay (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA).     High-throughput sequencing of libraries was conducted using the MiSeq Illumina apparatus of UMS2008 from Lorraine University (Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France) using Illumina's standard protocol.",

Despite its crucial role in host protection, effects on the human antibody repertoire are unknown. Consequently, we examined the IgM repertoire of five cosmonauts 25 days before launch, after 64 and 129 days spent on the International Space Station (ISS), and after 1, 7 and 30 days of Earth reambulation using high-throughput sequencing. This is the first study of this kind. Our data revealed that the IgM repertoire of cosmonauts was different from the one of control subjects already prior to launch, and that 2 out the 5 analyzed cosmonauts presented significant changes of their IgM repertoire during the mission. These modifications persisted up to 30 days after landing, likely affected the specificities of IgM binding sites, correlated with changes of the V(D)J recombination process in charge of creating functional antibody genes, and coincided with a higher stress response. These data confirm that about half of the astronauts who spent six months on the ISS are subjected to immunological changes, contribute to explain increased susceptibility to infection, reveal individual responses and consequently that personalized approaches should be implemented during future deep-space exploration missions that will endure for an unprecedented amount of time.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Three hiPSC lines were generated using a previously published Sendai virus reprogramming protocol on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from three healthy individuals (Churko et al., 2013). These hiPSC lines were differentiated into hiPSC-CMs using a 2D monolayer differentiation protocol and were maintained in a 5% CO2/air environment as previously described (Lian et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2012). Briefly, hiPSC colonies were dissociated with 0.5 mM EDTA into single-cell suspension and resuspended in E8 media (Life Technologies) containing 10 µM Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor (Sigma). Approximately 100,000 cells were replated into 6-well dishes pre-coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Next, hiPSC monolayers were cultured to 85% cell confluency. Cells were then treated for 2 days with 6 µM CHIR99021 (Selleck Chemicals) in RPMI 1640+B27 supplement without insulin to activate Wnt signaling and induce mesodermal differentiation. On day 2, cells were placed in RPMI+B27 without insulin and without CHIR99021. On days 3-4, cells were treated with 5 µM IWR-1 (Sigma) to inhibit Wnt pathway signaling and induce cardiogenesis. On days 5-6, cells were removed from IWR-1 treatment and placed in RPMI+B27 without insulin. From day 7 onwards, cells were placed in RPMI+B27 with insulin until beating was observed. At this point, cells were glucose-starved for 3 days with RPMI (no glucose)+B27 with insulin to purify the hiPSC-CMs, as CMs can selectively metabolize fatty acids as an alternate source of cellular energy (Tohyama et al., 2013). Following purification, cells were cultured in RPMI 1640+B27 with insulin. When replating hiPSC-CMs for downstream use, cells were dissociated with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies) into a single-cell suspension and seeded on Matrigel-coated “BioCell” 6-well plates customized for microgravity cell\nculture (BioServe Space Technologies).     Monolayers of beating hiPSC-CMs were sent to the ISS for 5.5 weeks. The hiPSC-CMs were grown in fully enclosed 6-well plates (BioCells) optimized for long-term microgravity cell culture. BioCells were launched to the ISS aboard a SpaceX Dragon transport spacecraft via a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during the SpaceX CRS-9 commercial resupply service mission. BioCells were maintained aboard the ISS in an on-station incubator (Space Automated Bioproduct Laboratory [SABL]) at 37C and 5% CO2, and ground control cells were cultured in parallel. The hiPSC-CMs within the BioCells were cultured in a high-nutrient CM maintenance medium that was changed weekly. Ground control hiPSC-CMs were maintained identically, with media changes replicated exactly on a 6-h delay from the ISS.     We analyzed the transcriptome of hiPSC-CMs during spaceflight and post-flight. hiPSC-CMs were harvested at 4.5 weeks in spaceflight and on day 10 after return to Earth. Ground hiPSC-CMs were collected at the post-return time point as controls. RNALater (Thermo Fisher) was used to preserve flight samples designated for downstream RNA-sequencing analysis.     Samples preserved in RNALater were stored at 4C until return to our laboratory, when RNA was isolated from preserved wells in the BioCells using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. DNase treatment was performed using RNase-free DNase kit (Qiagen). All RNA samples had RNA integrity number equal or higher than 8.9 and concentration equal or higher than 48 ng/uL (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer).     Library prep was performed by BGI using the TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit.     Sequencing was performed by BGI with 30-40 million paired-end 100bp reads per sample on the Illumina HiSeq platform.     Raw reads were aligned by HISAT2 (https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml)(Kim et al., 2015) to human genome (hg38).\n\nAligned reads were quantitated by FeatureCounts (http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/featureCounts/) with the annotation of ENSEMBL 85.\n\nNormalization and differentially expressed genes test were implemented by DESeq2 (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) (Liao et al., 2014; Love et al., 2014).\n\nSupplementary_files_format_and_content: table of normalized log2 transformed expression.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Homo sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.4/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Homo sapiens STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCh38 (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.107.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Homo sapiens STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to unstranded and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Description": "With extended stays aboard the International Space Station (ISS) becoming commonplace, there is a need to better understand the effects of microgravity on cardiac function. We utilized human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) to study the effects of microgravity on cell-level cardiac function and gene expression. The hiPSC-CMs were cultured aboard the ISS for 5.5 weeks and their gene expression, structure, and functions were compared to ground control hiPSC-CMs. Exposure to microgravity on the ISS caused alterations in hiPSC-CM calcium handling. RNA-sequencing analysis demonstrated 2,635 genes were differentially expressed among flight, post-flight, and ground control samples, including genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism. This study represents the first use of hiPSCs to model the effects of spaceflight on human cardiomyocyte structure and function.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "The study was performed within the 'Protokon' experiment. It included five Russian cosmonauts of 38–62 years of age (the average age was 45.5 years; four males and one female). The biological samples were collected one month before long-term (169–199 day) spaceflight (background) at the Yu. A. Gagarin Research and Test Cosmonaut Training Center, immediately after landing of the landing modules in the field (R0), and on the seventh day after landing as a part of a medical examination (R+7). The EBC study was approved (Code EBC proteome, date 06 March 2017) by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems, Russian Academy of Sciences/Physiology Section of the Russian Bioethics Committee Russian Federation National Commission for UNESCO and Human Research Multilateral Review Board, NASA, Houston, TX, USA. All donors signed the informed consent for participation in the study.\n\nThe EBC was collected using a portable RTube device. During EBC collection, the cosmonaut breathed quietly, for 10–15 min, through a special mouthpiece with a salivary trap, and the exhaled airflow was diverted through a Teflon or polypropylene tube inside a cooling container. Immediately after collection samples were transported at −20C and stored at −80C until use.     The sample preparation for LC-MS analysis included freeze-drying and selective tryptic hydrolysis at 37C for 17 h as previously discussed.     The tryptic peptide fraction (injection volume 1 µL) was analyzed in triplicate on a nano-HPLC Dionex Ultimate3000 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) coupled to a TiMS TOF mass spectrometry system (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) using a captive spray ion source (positive ion mode, 1600 V) (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). HPLC separation was performed on a C18 capillary column (25 cm × 75 µm × 1.6 µm) (Ion Optics, Parkville, Australia) at a flow rate of 0.4 uL/min by gradient elution. The mobile phase A was 0.1% formic acid in water and mobile phase B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The separation was carried out by a 40 min gradient from 3–90% of phase B.     MS data were analyzed using the MaxQuant (v 1.6.5) program against the SwissProt Human database with an initial precursor mass error of 70 ppm. The minimum peptide length for identification was set to seven amino acids; the match between the runs option was activated. The cutoff false discovery rate (FDR) for proteins and peptides was set to 0.01 (1% FDR). Label-free quantitative analysis was performed in order to determine the significantly changed proteins. Quantification of peptides was recognized on the basis of mass and retention time but identified in other LC-MS/MS runs. Proteins quantification was carried out using the label-free quantification (LFQ) intensities of peptides across all samples and represented by a normalized intensity profile generated according to the specific algorithms. Protein–protein interactions were analyzed using the STRING database (v 11.0). The minimum coefficient of interaction score was 0.4; the PPI enrichment p-value was less than 1.0 × 10−16. The interactions included physical and functional associations derived from computational prediction, automated text mining, co-expression databases and genomic context prediction aggregated from other databases. Protein categorical annotations were derived from GeneOntology using the SwissProt Human database. The mass spectrometric proteomic data were deposited into the ProteomeXchange Consortium through the PRIDE partner repository.",

Semi-quantitative label-free proteomic analysis of 13 EBC samples collected from 5 Russian cosmonauts before and after long-term (169–199 days) spaceflights were performed and resulted in 164 different proteins. The highest number of proteins was detected in EBC after landing (R0). Pathways enrichment analysis via GO database large group of proteins that take part in keratinization processes (CASP14, DSG1, DSP, JUP, and etc). Nine proteins were KRT2, KRT9, KRT1, KRT10, KRT14, DCD, KRT6C, KRT6A, KRT5 were detected in all groups (background, R0, R+1). A two-sample Welch’s t-test identified the significant changing of KRT2 and KRT9 levels after landing. Enrichment analysis via KEGG database revealed significant participation (2,07E-06) of detected proteins in pathogenic E. coli infection (ACTG1, TUBA1C, TUBA4A, TUBB, TUBB8, YWHAZ). Presumably, presents of this proteins can associated with changing of cosmonauts’ microbial composition. Thus EBC can be used for noninvasive monitoring of health status and respiratory tract pathologies during the spaceflight.

          "Study Protocol Description": "For proteomic analysis, 200 μL of blood plasma was used for high-abundance protein depletion (ProteoMinerTM, BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) and a concentration of low-abundance proteins. The samples were prepared via the filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) protocol using 10 kDa filters (Merc, London, UK). Plasma proteins were reduced with 0.1 М DTT in 8 M Urea (pH 8.5); alkylated with 0.55M iodoacetamide and digested using trypsin (17 hours, 37C).     The tryptic peptide fraction (injection volume 2 uL) was analyzed in triplicate on a nano-HPLC Dionex Ultimate3000 system (Thermo) coupled to a MaXis 4G (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) using a nanospray ion source(positive ion mode, 1600 V). HPLC separation was performed on a C18 capillary column (75 µm x 50cm, C18, 3µm, 100 A) at a flow rate of 0.3 uL/min by gradient elution with the mobile phase A being 0.1% formic acid in water and mobile phase B - 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile.

All subjects provided written informed consent to participate in the ‘‘Proteome’’ experiment.\n\nFive healthy men from 20 to 44 years of age were included in the head-down bedrest experiment (HDBR). They voluntarily remained in a bed rest position with an angle of inclination of the longitudinal axis of the body relative to the horizontal position of 6° for 21 days. Subjects characteristics were as follows: 34.3 ± 8.3 year (age), 1.76 ± 0.06 m (height), 69.8 ± 8.0 kg (weight), body mass index 22.4 ± 1.7 (BMI). All the subjects consumed controlled amount of all nutrients in the diet such as proteins, fats, carbohydrates and vitamins, calculated (calories per day) according to general recommendations by the European Space Agency (ESA). The studies were conducted under controlled life conditions of the volunteers at the MEDES research center in Toulouse, France. The examined group was not exposed to any additional stress to prevent the development of adaptive changes in physiological systems. More detailed subjects’ characteristics, medical check-up, inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as dropout criteria and study design have been described previously.\n\nSamples from the dry immersion study were obtained from 5 volunteers participating in a 21-day-long experiment.

This study was conducted under controlled life conditions at the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBP) of the Russian Federation State Scientific.  During ground-based experiments, cushion using was not restricted. Participants selected for the experiments were non-smokers, non-drugs takers and did not exhibit acute or chronic pathologies which could affect the physiological data. The volunteers had normal clinical and paramedical examination and laboratory tests (hematology and blood chemistry). All the participants gave their informed consent to the experimental conditions after the details of the protocol were explained to them.\n\nAll blood samples (~6 mL) were taken from a vein in the cubital fossa, the collection was done in commercial Monovette tubes (SARSTEDT, Germany) containing EDTA (K3) as the anticoagulant. No protease inhibitors or antimicrobial agents were added. The samples were centrifuged for plasma separation (2000 rpm for 15 min, +4 °C) immediately after collection. The supernatant was frozen at −80 °C and stored before further sample preparation for LC-MS analysis. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "The experiment was stopped after the third medium change by means of two subsequent exchanges with RNAlater in eight EH modules and two subsequent exchanges with NOTOXhisto in the remaining four EH modules; the fixative exchanges were separated by a 6 min interval. After each exchange, a protease inhibitor cocktail was added to the exhausted culture medium. Then the temperature in MELFI fridge was set at 2 °C until the return of the experiment on Earth. The EH modules were subsequently kept at 2 °C inside the MELFI fridge where they remained for longer than expected due to a delay (∼ 1 month) in the return of the Soyuz to Earth. Indeed Soyuz -TMA-15M with Expedition 43 crew landed in Kazakhstan on June 11, 2015 and the EH modules were delivered to PI in Milan 2 days later.     Samples were suspended by scraping in 500 μL of Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for total RNA extraction.     5-30 ng of high quality total RNA were used to synthesize Biotin-labeled cDNA targets. Double stranded cDNA synthesis and related cRNA was performed with Nugen® Pico WTA Systems V2 (NuGEN Technologies, Inc). With the Encore® Biotin Module (NuGEN Technologies, Inc) was synthesized the fragmented and labeled cDNA.     Hybridization was performed onto Affymetrix Gene Human 1.0 ST arrays (28.869 genes) (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA,USA).     GeneChip arrays were scanned using an AffymetrixGeneChip® Scanner3000 7G using default parameters. AffymetrixGeneChip® Command Console software (AGCC) was used to acquire GeneChip® images and generate .DAT and .CEL files     Human bone marrow MSCs (hBMSCs) were kindly provided by Ospedale Sacco, University of Milan Italy, with the collaboration of prof. JAM Maier and her group, dr. Sara Castiglioni and dr. Cazzaniga et al. (2016). Briefly, human BMSCs cells were cultured on Thermanox collagen coated coverslips for ∼ 17 days either in Standard Medium (SM) or in Osteogenic Medium (OM), the composition of which were the following: a) SM: DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s medium) supplemented with 12.5 mM HEPES, 10 U/mL heparin, 200 mM glutamine, 500 μg/mL streptomycin sulphate, 600 μg/mL penicillin; b) OM: SM added with 0.1 M ascorbic acid, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, and 10− 8 M 1,25(OH)2D3 (Vit D3). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA. Thermanox coverslips were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.Waltham, MA USA.     The SCD experiment consisted of 24 experimental hardware modules (EH) (12 flight modules and 12 ground modules), each of which had one experiment unit (EU) integrated into the KUBIC interface container single level (KIC-SL). Each EU consisting of a brick containing 5 cylinders (for the medium and chemicals), a cell culture chamber (CC), and connecting channels. Five small valves were placed to separate the different fluids and the CC. Each cylinder had a piston to inject a new fluid into the CC; the waste medium was collected in the previously emptied cylinder and suitably preserved.\nEH were trasferred on board the ISS by the Soyuz-TMA-16M (ISS 42S, launched on March 27, 2015); 27°C was the temperature recorded for the samples in the Soyouz vehicle before docking and installation in the KUBIK incubator on board the ISS. The experimental proifile consisted of: 1) installation in KUBIK (T0); 2) Start with the first medium exchange (T0+7h); 3) Second medium exchange (T0+7d); 4)Third medium exchange with PBS (T0+14d); 5) Stop by means of two subsequent exchanges with RNAlater     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.0 (GitHub link coming soon).  In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.2). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using oligo (version 1.58.0). Raw data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). The raw probe level intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the oligo (version 1.58.0) quantile method. Normalized probe level data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0).  Normalized probe level data was summarized to the probeset level using the oligo (version 1.58.0) RMA method. Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probeset using biomaRt (version 2.50.0), Ensembl database (ensembl.org, release 107). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probeset to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned for every probeset that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Description": "Microgravity produces a variety of physical, chemical, and biological cues leading to an intricate and largely unresolved network of mechanosensitive molecules, transduction pathways, oxidative stress-related responses, and adaptations. The bone loss observed in astronauts and animal models after spaceflight is attributable to alterations in the bone tissue formation that depends on the continuous remodelling through the activities of bone-resorbing osteoclasts of hematopoietic lineage and bone-forming osteoblast of mesenchymal origin. Focusing on osteogenic differentiation, we present the results of the ”SCD - Stem Cells Differentiation” experiment, aiming to determine how human bone marrow stem cells (hBMSCs) react to a prolonged (approx. 2 weeks) exposure to microgravity in terms of growth, and differentiation when treated with a physiological osteo-inducer as 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (Vit D3). The experiment was selected by the European Space Agency and transferred to ISS with the Soyuz-TMA- 16M (ISS 42S). It was carefully prepared because experiments performed on ISS remain a uniquely exceptional means of clarifying the microgravitational effects on osteogenesis, often only partially activated and detectable under simulated conditions. Because of the substantial reduction in calcification observed (about 50% inflight vs. on-ground control), we looked at significantly affected pathways in hBMSCs grown in microgravity vs. on-ground controls. Genome-wide expression changes were assessed via microarray and next generation sequencing (NGS) and integrated with exosomal mi-RNA measurements. Multi-scale pathway analysis of the omics datasets revealed evidence of cell cycle arrest, occurring with a number of osteogenic gene markers, but without indications of adipogenesis, senescence and/or apoptosis.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Cardiovacular progenitor cells (CPCs) were isolated from cardiac tissue of neonatal (1 day - 1 month) or adult (57 - 72 year old) human patients, as previously described. The methods were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations and were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Loma Linda University for the use of discarded tissue without identifiable private information under a waiver of informed consent. Thus, informed consent was not required since the discarded tissue was not collected specifically for this study, and the tissue was obtained with no identifiable patient-specific information. Briefly, atrial tissue was cut into small clumps (approximately 1.0 mm3) then enzymatically digested using collagenase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) at a working concentration of 1 mg/mL. The resulting solution was then passed through a 40-um cell strainer. Cells were cloned in a 96-well plate by limiting dilution to a final concentration of 0.8 cells per well to create populations for expansion. Cells were then screened for the co-expression of Isl1 and c-Kit. Clonal CPC cultures were selected for other markers of early cardiac development (KDR and PDGFRA) and then supplemented with growth media comprised of 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), 100 ug/mL penicillin–streptomycin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), 1% minimum essential medium non-essential amino acids solution (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), and 22% endothelial cell growth media (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) in Medium 199 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Mycoplasma contamination was tested using the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) following the manufacturer's protocol.     Neonatal and adult CPCs were seeded into Biocells (BioServe Space Technologies, Boulder, CO) at two seeding densities (7500 cells or 5000 cells) and loaded into self-contained environments containing 5% CO2 and 95% air. The seeding conditions were carefully titrated on Earth to identify the most optimal conditions under which CPCs could be cultured over the course of the experiment. These conditions were then tested during an Experiment Verification Test, which was performed with BioServe Space Technologies ahead of the mission launch. They were then flown aboard SpaceX CRS-11 to the US National Lab on the ISS where they were placed in an incubator containing 5% CO2 and 95% air. Fresh media was provided every 4 to 5 days while aboard the ISS. At 12 days, the Biocells that were seeded with 7500 cells were flooded with RNAProtect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and stored at -80C. At 30 days, the Biocells seeded with 5000 cells were fed and returned to Earth. Clone-matched and passage-matched ground controls were fed and treated in parallel with the feeding schedule and activities performed by astronauts aboard the ISS.     Upon landing and retrieval of the payload, live cells were trypsinized, counted, and used to assess cell cycle, migration, and endothelial-like tube formation, as well as to prepare protein lysates. Biocells containing cells fixed and frozen in RNAprotect were thawed at room temperature. The RNAprotect was removed and centrifuged at 10,000xg at 4C for 10min. Biocells were disassembled and the culture membranes were then rinsed with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). RNA was purified from the RNAprotect samples using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), per the manufacturer's instructions, while total RNA was purified from TRIzol reagent using isopropanol-based and ethanol-based precipitation.     Reverse transcription was performed from 2000 ng total RNA using the Superscript III kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).     Then thoroughly mixed with 2xRT2 SYBR Green Mastermix and RNase-free and DNase-free water before being loaded into the profiler array plate. Samples were amplified in the iCycler iQ5 PCR Thermal Cycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA) using a protocol of 95C for 10 min and 40 cycles of 95C for 15s and 60C for 1min.\n\nWe used custom array plates (CLAH22469A; Qiagen, Valencia, CA) per the manufacturer's instructions to measure gene expression changes in ISS-cultured adult and neonatal CPCs that were relevant to Wnt, ERK, BMP/Smad, and Notch signaling; cytoskeletal maintenance; calcium handling; apoptosis and cell cycle; cardiac development and stemness; and regeneration.     Fold changes were determined for each clone individually using the Qiagen Data Analysis Center using GAPDH and ACTB (beta-actin) as housekeeping genes. Target gene signals normalized to housekeeping genes; 2^-deltaCt, where deltaCt = (Ct_Target - Ct_HKG)].\nFold changes per clone were exported to Prism for subsequent analysis. Fold Change worksheet reports test/control (i.e., ISS-cultured CPCs/ground CPCs) ratios.     Reverse transcription was performed from 500 ng total RNA using the miScript SYBR Green PCR master mix and 10X universal primer mix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).\n\nQuantitative real-time PCR were performed (iQ5 thermal cycler, BioRad) with 40 cycles at 94C for 15 seconds, 55C for 30 secons, and 70C for 30 seconds.     PCR assays were performed using human development and differentiation microarray plates (MIHS-103ZA; Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the Manufacturer’s instructions.     Normalization and comparative Ct method analysis per clone was perofmred using Qiagen's web-based software package: http://www.qiagen.com/ us/shop/genes-and-pathways/data-analysis-center-overview-page/\nFor normalization, we used the average of all available housekeeping genes included on the microarray plates\nTarget gene signals normalized to housekeeping genes; 2^-deltaCt, where deltaCt = (Ct_Target -  Ct_HKG)].\nFold changes per clone were exported to Prism for subsequent analysis.

          "Study Protocol Description": "Immediately after fixation, samples were transferred to a 4C refrigerator onboard the ISS. On May 18, 2014, the samples were returned to Earth. Samples were kept at 4C until\nthey arrived at the Johnson Space Center (Houston, TX, USA). Total RNA was then isolated by using miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\nprotocol. The residual genomic DNA was removed by using Qiagen RNase free DNase kit.     Quantification of mRNA and miRNA expressions was performed at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center as described previously. In brief, Illumina Human HT-12 V4 Beadchip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) human whole genome expression arrays, each of which contains 47,231 probes, were used in this study. Of each RNA sample, 500 ng was amplified by using the Ambion TotalPrep RNA amplification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Whaltham, MA, USA) with biotin uridine triphosphate (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA) labeling. The Ambion Illumina RNA amplification kit used T7 oligo(dT) primer to generate single-stranded cDNA followed by a second strand synthesis to generate double-stranded cDNA, which was then column purified. In vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase generated biotin-labeled cRNA.     The cRNA was then column purified, checked for size and yield by using the Bio-Rad Experion system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and hybridized to each array by using the\nstandard Illumina protocols with streptavidin-Cy3 (Amersham, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) that are used for detection.     Slides were scanned, and fluorescence intensity was captured by using an Illumina HiScan system.     Data processing and visualization Expression values were extracted byusing Genome Studio2010.2 software (Illumina). The data was background subtracted and quantil-normalized by using the Model-Based Background Correction algorithm.     Flight hardware: BioCells cell culture chambers (BioServe Space Technologies, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA) were used to culture the cells in the flight experiments. The top surface of the chamber was made of a porous membrane that allowed for the exchange of O2 and CO2 with the medium. The bottom surfacewas cut from the bottomof a T-150 flask(Corning, Corning, NY, USA) that was treated for tissue culture and mounted with seal gaskets. Adherent cells were grown on the bottom surface only. The chamber contained 3 ports that, during the respective steps, could be connected to syringes or bags containing washing or fixing solutions. Before launch, BioCells were sterilized by g radiation and the\nchambers were filled with medium and sealed in a cell culture habitat that contained 5% CO2. The habitat was then placed into a commercial generic bioprocessing apparatus (CGBA; BioServe Space Technologies) at a preset temperature. Once the cells reached the ISS, the habitat was transferred to another CGBA located onboard the ISS laboratory module.\n\nCell culture: Normal human foreskin fibroblast cells (AG1522; National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) were grown in cultured dishes in amonolayer and growth was contact inhibited. Cells of, 10 passages, routinely cultured at 37C, 95% humidity, and 5% CO2 in a–minimum essential medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,CA, USA) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 mg/ml penicillinstreptomycin (Invitrogen), were used as described in a previous study. Cells at passage 6 were frozen and shipped to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) months before the scheduled launch date. Two weeks before launch, cells were thawed and plated in T-75 flasks. Seven days before launch, cells were seeded in the BioCell cell culture chambers (10 flight and 10 ground control BioCells) at a density of 13x10^6 cells per BioCell. Cells reached confluence 2 d before launch, with 92% of the cells expected to be in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. One day before launch, medium in the BioCell was replaced with fresh medium, and the cell culture chambers were inserted in sealed habitats (5 BioCells per habitat) that were each flushed with 5% CO2/balance air. The samples were transported to the launch pad and kept at 20C. Ground controls were prepared by following the same procedure that was used for the preparation of the flight samples.\n\nExperimental timeline: On April 18, 2014, our experimental payload was launched from the KSC in Cape Canaveral, FL,USA. The cells were kept at 20C until they reached the ISS. On April 22, the 2 habitats containing the cells were transferred to another CGBA that was preset at 37C. On April 25 and again on May 6, the cells were fixed for analysis of the different end points. Werefer to these 2 dates asd 3 and 14, respectively, when the cells were placed in the 37C CGBA on orbit. To preserve total RNA, including miRNA, 4 filled BioCells were removed from the CGBA at each time point, washed with PBS, and fixed with RNALater II at a final concentration of 90%. In addition, one BioCell at each time point was washed with PBS and fixed with a final concentration of 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 min at room temperature before being washed with PBS. Astronaut Thomas Marshburn processed the samples on the ISS in a glove bag. The ground control experiment was performed in the same manner, but with a 6-h offset from the flight schedule at KSC.     Exiqon seventh-generation miRcury LNA microRNA Arrays (Exiqon, Woburn, MA, USA) were used in this study. Arrays consisted of control probes and 3100 capture probes that\nwere complementary to human, mouse, rat, and their related viral sequences from the v19.0 release of miRBase. The arrays also contained a number of proprietary human miRPlus sequences not yet in miRBase. For each sample, 750 ng total RNA with miRNA was labeled by using the miRCURY LNA microRNA Array Hi-Power labeling kit following a 2-step protocol. The first step included calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase for the removal of 59-phosphates from the terminal of the miRNAs. In the second step, a Hy3 fluorescent label\nwas attached enzymatically to the 39-end of the miRNAs in the total RNA sample. This was followed by an enzyme inactivation step after which the sample was ready for hybridization.     Hybridization was carried out according to the Exiqon protocol by using an Agilent hybridization SureHyb chamber kit (Agilent Technologies, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and\na gasket slide kit (Agilent Technologies).     The slides were scanned by using a Tecan PowerScanner (Tecan Trading AG, Mannedorf, Switzerland), which was performed at a resolution of 10 mm.     Feature extraction and quality control were performed by using ImaGene 9.0 software (BioDiscovery).  Log2 differences were used in comparisons. Hierarchical clustering was performed by using Pearson correlation metrics, and an average hierarchical algorithm was used as the clusteringmethod. Nexus Expression 3.0 was used to calculate differentially expressed miRNAs across samples, and these miRNAs were visualized in heatmaps and cluster diagrams. The local median background subtraction from each spot and quantile normalization were performed by using Nexus Expression 3.0 (BioDiscovery).",

Recent advancement in the field of molecular biology revealed that a different class of RNA, the small non-coding microRNA (miRNA), can have a broad effect on gene expression networks by mainly inhibiting the translational process. In this experiment conducted on the International Space Station, we propose to test the hypotheses that miRNA profiles will be altered in the space environment, and that cellular responses to DNA damage in space are different from those on the ground.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Total RNA was extracted using Qiagen miRNeasy Mini kits. RNA quality was verified by Nanodrop Spectophotometer and Agilent Bioanalyzer.     Single color labeling with Cyanine-3 (Cy3), using Agilent kit and protocol     Followed Agilent protocol for SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression v3 8x60K Microarray Kit (G4851). 50 ng of total RNA was used for RNA amplification and labeling according to the Agilent Quick Amp Labeling Kit (for one-color) Protocol Version 6.7, using Agilent Labeling Kit along with an Agilents RNA Spike-In Kit (Agilent). The resulting cRNAs were purified using Qiagen RNeasy mini spin columns and measured again on the Nanodrop for yields (1.1 to 1.5 ug per sample) and dye incorporation (average 13.2 pmol/ug, with 2 of the 15 samples at 7.7 and 9.9 pmol/ug). The samples were then fragmented and 0.6 g of each hybridization mixture was loaded onto the arrays.     The slides were scanned with Agilent Scanner (G2565BA) using Scanner Version C and Scan Control software version A.8.5.1.     The scanned images were processed with Agilent Feature Extraction Software Version 11.0.1.1 to obtain background subtracted and spatially detrended Processed Signal intensities..     Flight experimental timeline:\nOn April 18, 2014, our experimental payload was launched from NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida. The cells were kept at 20°C until they reached the ISS. On April 22, the two habitats containing the cells were then transferred to another CGBA preset at 370 C. On April 25, the cells were removed from the CGBA incubator, and the BioCell cell culture chamber was injected with bleomycin at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml or placebo using the same amount of PBS. This concentration is equivalent to exposure of about 0.4 Gy γ-radiation [31], and resulted in a balanced distribution of three types of DNA damages in our ground experiment (Fig 2). The cells were then transferred back to CGBA. After 3 hr incubation with bleomycin, a total of 8 BioCells containing bleomycin or placebo treated cells were removed from the CGBA, washed with PBS, and fixed with RNALater II at a final concentration of approximately 90%. In addition, one BioCell from each treatment group was washed with PBS and fixed with a final concentration of 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 min at room temperature before being washed with PBS.\n\nGround experiment with different bleomycin concentrations and with cells in different growth conditions:\nConfluent AG1522 cells were treated with bleomycin for concentrations of 0.1, 1 and 10 μg/ml for 3 hrs before fixation with 2% PFA for 30 min in order to obtain a dose response relationship, and to determine the concentration used in the flight experiment. To test whether the differences in cellular responses to bleomycin treatment could be attributed to the cell growth condition, AG1522 cells at confluence or in exponentially growth stage were treated with 1 μg/ml bleomycin for 3 hr as in the flight experiment. Cells in these two growth conditions were also fixed with 2% PFA for 30 min. at room temperature at the end of the 3-hr treatment.     Immediately after fixation, the samples were transferred to a 4°C refrigerator onboard the ISS. On May 18, 2014, the samples were returned to Earth. The samples were kept at 4° C until they arrived at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas. Total RNA was then isolated using miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The residual genomic DNA was removed using Qiagen RNase free DNase kit.\n\nProcessing of the samples on the ISS was performed by an astronaut using a glove bag. The ground control experiment was performed in the same manner, but with a 6-hour offset from the flight schedule at KSC. Cells fixed with paraformaldehyde from spaceflight and ground experiments were rinsed with 1xPBS. Each cell culture plate was separated into 12 pieces and stored in methanol at -20°C.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "A hair root was cut into ~15 fragments by using knife under a stereoscopic microscope. Collected fragments were immersed of ISOGEN (TakaraBio, Kyoto, Japan) in tube and stirred using the Bioruptor UCD250 (Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan). Next, Total RNA was purified from hair lysates by using the ISOGEN as manufacutuerer's recommendation. Total RNA was amplified using the Ambion MessageAmp aRNA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA). Each RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop-1000 spectrophotometer and quality was monitored with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     Cyanine-3 (Cy3) labeled aRNA was prepared from RNA using the MessageAmp aRNA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by RNeasy column purification (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). Dye incorporation and cRNA yield were checked with the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer.     An 1.5 ug of Cy3-labelled cRNA (specific activity >10.0 pmol Cy3/ug cRNA) was fragmented at 60C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 0.1ml containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturers instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 0.1 ml of 2x Agilent hybridization buffer was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to Agilent Human Gene Expression 4x44K v2 Microarray Kit (G4845A) for 17 hours at 65C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately by brief centrifugation.     Slides were scanned on the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2505B)     The scanned images were analyzed with Feature Extraction Software (Agilent) using default parameters to obtain background subtracted and spatially detrended Processed Signal intensities. Features flagged in Feature Extraction as Feature Non-uniform outliers were excluded.     In each mission, five strands of hair were sampled six times from each astronaut within the period of July 2009 to February 2013. The sampling timings were as follows: 6 sampling time points (Fig 1); first preflight (Launch (L) -180 to -90 days: 6 to 3 months before launch), second preflight (L-60 to -14: 2 months to 2 weeks before launch), first inflight (L+20 to 37: 20 to 37 days after launch), second inflight (Return (R) -20 to -7: 20 to 7 days before return), first postflight (R+2 to 7: 2 to 7 days after return), and second postflight (R+30 to 90: from 1 to 3 months after return).  In sampling day, two astronauts were paired and plucked another hair sample using tweezer in the direction of hair growth without damaging the hair roots. These plucked samples were stored at -80C until analysis.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Permission to collect blood from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronauts was obtained from the Johnson Space Center Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects. Consenting astronauts from several shuttle missions provided whole blood samples 10 days prior to shuttle launch (L-10) and several hours after return to earth (R+0). Whole blood was collected into a Vacutainer Blood collection tubes and then transferred into PAXgene tubes (PreAnalytiX, Hombrechtikon, CH), according to the manufacturer's instructions.     Total RNA was isolated from whole blood samples using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (PreAnalytiX, Hombrechtikon, CH), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Duplicate RNA samples were combined and DNase treated using a DNA-free kit (Ambion). RNA was quantitated by ultraviolet absorbance, concentrated by ethanol precipitation and re-suspended in deionized water (BD Biosciences Clontech) to yield a 4 ug sample of RNA for each astronaut at L-10 and R+0. RNA integrity was confirmed using denaturing Formaldehyde-Agarose gel electrophoresis.     Total RNA was converted to 32P-labeled first-strand cDNA by reverse transcription. Reaction volumes were optimized for increased detection on the arrays as follows: 4 ug of total RNA was combined with 2 ul gene-specific CDS primer mix (BD Biosciences Clontech). A master mix was prepared at room temperature including 4 ul 5X Reaction Buffer, 2 ul 10X dNTP Mix (for dATP label), 5 ul [alpha-32P]dATP (10uCi/ul), and 1 ul 100mM DTT. Two microliters of MMLV Reverse Transcriptase was added to the master mix, and was combined with the RNA, primer mix. All incubations were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Labeled probes were purified using column chromatography (BD Biosciences Clontech).          Radioactive cDNA probes were hybridized to the microarrays at 68C overnight in ExpressHyb solution (BD Biosciences Clontech) and washed according to the manufacturer's instructions.     Arrays were exposed to a phosphoimager screen at room temperature for 3 days.     For Flight samples: Arrays were analyzed using Atlas Image 2.0 software (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Arrays were normalized to the following housekeeping genes: ubiquitin C (UBC), liver glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), tubulin alpha 1 (TUBA1), and major histocompatability complex class I C (HLAC). After background subtraction for each array, the ratio of the post-flight adjusted intensity values (R+0) to the pre-flight adjusted intensity values (L-10) was calculated. Only genes with at least four data points pre-flight and post-flight were taken into consideration for data analysis. ID_REF equals  VALUE equals Background subtracted intensity and gene based normalization.  See Barrila et al. (2013) for details.\n\nFor Control (non-astronaut) sample: Arrays were analyzed using Atlas Image 2.0 software (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. All astronaut arrays (L-10 and R+0) were normalized to an average of 5 control arrays from the whole blood of healthy non-astronaut control subjects. Arrays were normalized using the following housekeeping genes: ubiquitin C (UBC), liver glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), tubulin alpha 1 (TUBA1), and major histocompatability complex class I C (HLAC). After background subtraction for each array, the ratio of the post-flight adjusted intensity values (R+0) to the pre-flight adjusted intensity values (L-10) was calculated.

Here we report the first microarray evaluation of any astronaut tissue sample, specifically whole blood, before and after spaceflight using an array comprising 234 well-characterized stress response genes. Differentially regulated genes included those important for DNA repair, oxidative stress, and protein folding/degradation. Microarrays comprising 234 well characterized stress-related genes were used to profile transcriptomic changes in six astronauts before and after short-duration spaceflight. Blood samples were collected for analysis from each eastronaut 10 days prior and 2-3 hours after return from spaceflight. Data submitted for platform GPL140 contain genes that have been pre-filtered by the analytical software to remove values of low certainty, resulting in missing values for some samples. Unfortunately, these original data are no longer available due to physical damage at Tulane University during hurricane Katrina, but the processed values were retained in redundant locations and these are submitted for upload to GEO.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "SPHINX was launched with Progress 40P and, as soon as docking was complete (four days after launch, T0), the experiment was started inside a KUBIC incubator on the ISS. Timeline: T0: installation in KUBIK; T0 + 7 hrs: first medium exchange; T0 + 91 hrs: second medium exchange; T0 + 167 hrs: third medium exchange with PBS. The experiment was stopped by means of two subsequent RNAlater fixations separated by an interval of six minutes. After the experiment had been completed, the samples were kept at 6°C inside the KUBIK incubator before being returned to Earth on Soyuz 23S. Twelve control experiments were carried out in parallel using the same hardware and experimental protocol.     Samples were preserved in RNAlater and mantained at 6°C before analyses     HUVEC, preserved in RNAlater solution, were subjected to total RNA extraction following the double extraction protocol: RNA isolation by acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction (Trizol Invitrogen) followed by a Qiagen RNeasy clean-up procedure.     Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 150 ug total RNA     Hybridization was performed using the GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit. GeneChip cartridges were washed and stained with GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 following the FS450_0007 standard protocol     GeneChip arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G using default parameters     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.5 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.5/Microarray/Affymetrix/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAffymetrix). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.4). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using oligo (version 1.58.0). Raw data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). The raw probe level intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the oligo (version 1.58.0) quantile method. Normalized probe level data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). Normalized probe level data was summarized to the probeset level using the oligo (version 1.58.0) RMA method. Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probeset using biomaRt (version 2.50.0), Ensembl database (ensembl.org, release 107). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probeset to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned for every probeset that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

All of these are associated with endothelial dysfunction but the precise mechanism is still unclear. We used the microarray approach to obtain insights into the mechanism responsible for endothelial dysfunction by taking advantage of the challenging environment of gravitational unloading onboard the International Space Station.

Experimental units were launched into space and placed into the KUBIK facility onboard the International Space Station. The 1g units were placed in the central centrifuge positions and centrifuged with an applied 1g force. The ug units were place in the static positions for continued mg exposure.

          "Managing NASA Center": "Ames Research Center (ARC)",
          "Study Description": "This study tested the hypothesis that transcription of immediate early genes is inhibited in T cells activated in microgravity (uG). Immunosuppression during spaceflight is a major barrier to safe long-term human space habitation and travel. The goals of these experiments were to prove that uG was the cause of impaired T cell activation during spaceflight as well as understand the mechanisms controlling early T cell activation. T cells from 4 human donors were stimulated with concanavalin A (ConA) and anti-CD28 onboard the International Space Station (ISS). An onboard centrifuge was used to generate a 1g simultaneous control to isolate the effects of uG from other variables of spaceflight. Microarray expression analysis after 1.5 hours of activation demonstrated that mg- and 1g-activated T cells had distinct patterns of global gene expression and identified 47 genes that were significantly differentially down-regulated in uG. Importantly, several key immediate early genes were inhibited in uG. T cells were isolated from human volunteers. T cells from each donor were kept separate and loaded into individual chambers in separate cassettes for the following treatments: uG non-activated, uG activated, and 1g activated. Therefore, samples represent biological triplicates. Experimental units were launched into space and placed into the KUBIK facility onboard the International Space Station. The 1g units were placed in the central centrifuge positions and centrifuged with an applied 1g force. The uG units were place in the static positions for continued uG exposure. After 30 minutes of pre-incubation, uG non-activated units were fixed by addition of RNALater (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA), removed from the incubator, and stored in 4°C. The uG and 1g activated units were injected with final concentration 10mg/ml Con A and 4mg/ml anti-CD28. These cassettes were replaced into KUBIK on either the centrifuge or static positions and activated for 1.5 hours. Activation was stopped with the addition of RNALater and the units were then moved to 4°C storage. All units were returned to Earth for analysis.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-dBL) (Lonza, VA) were maintained in EGM-2MV growth medium (Lonza, VA) containing growth factors, antimicrobials, cytokines and 5% FBS (all purchased from Lonza, VA) at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.     Exposures of 100 g/ml LPS for 4 hr and 8 hr.     The absorbed dose from ionizing radiation received by the flight specimens was estimated using TLD passive dosimeters located in the middeck of the space shuttle, where the payload was located. More specifically, we computed the average between three dosimeters (DLOC1, DLOC2, and DLOC3) for the mission and we divided it by the total duration of the mission to estimate the average absorbed dose rate in mGy/day. This dose rate did not include any shielding effects from the hardware where the specimens resided. The total absorbed dose in water was then computed by simply multiplying the average dose rate with the duration of the experiment. The duration of the experiment was defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”. Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. A table with these detailed computations for all space shuttle datasets is available on GeneLab at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation. The ground samples were not assessed for radiation exposure.     We extracted mRNA and miRNA from the RLT solution using the AllPrep DNA/RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, MD) and from the TrizolTM portion following the manufacturer's protocols.     We labeled 12.5 ng amplified RNA and the same amount of reference RNA with Cy-5 and Cy-3 dyes, respectively.     Samples were hybridized to Agilent-014850 4x44K slides and incubated for 16 h at 55 C. A protocol with a series of washes was carried out.     The slides were scanned using Agilent Technologies Scanner G2505C US09493743 and feature extracted (software v. 10.7, Agilent, Inc, CA).     We processed the microarray mRNA data set by heuristic statistical manipulations accompanied by a systematic selection and rejection scheme. We performed pair-wise moderated t-test (p less than 0.01), a recommended routine for small sample size enabling to deliver maximum confidence in the analyses. ID_REF equals  VALUE equals Normalized Cy5/Cy3 signal (p greater than 0.05 from the assay background)",

          "Study Description": "Microgravity alters the immune response to in vitro LPS assault engineered in spaceflight: A multi-omics study Microgravity can facilitate creation of a potent environment for opportunistic infection by augmenting virulence and suppressing the host defense. Presumably, extraterrestrial infection may trigger potentially novel bionetworks different from the terrestrial equivalent, which could only be probed by investigating the host-pathogen relationship with minimum terrestrial bias. Towards this objective, we strategically engineered a cell culture module equipped with a feedback controlled semi-automated platform to expose human endothelial cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The assay was carried out in the STS-135 space shuttle, and a concurrent ground study constituted the baseline. Transcriptomic investigation revealed an immune blunting in microgravity; Lbp, MyD88 and MD-2 failed to encode proteins responsible for early LPS uptake. Longer exposure results implied that there was a delayed response, potentially ineffectual in preventing pathogens from opportunistically modulating the infection network. Lack of recruitment of growth factors and a debilitated apoptosome supported this potential explanation. Certain cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-8, surged in response to LPS insult in microgravity. Contrasting expressions of B2M, TIMP-1 and VEGRs suggested impaired pro-survival adaptation and healing mechanisms. The susceptibility of oxidative stress and immune regulation to microgravity compelled further investigation of the respective microRNA modulators such as miR-200a and miR-146b. These miRNAs were expressed differently in response to LPS assaults in different gravitational limits. In conclusion, despite a serious drawback attributed to the small sample size, we delineated some of the important aspects of the extraterrestrial etiology; more comprehensive follow up studies are warranted. Present study though compromised by the small sample size was able to shade lights on several aspects of immunological responses to the endotoxic assault mediated by uG. Implementing the host-pathogen interactions in the spaceflight and subsequently lysing the cells onboard presented the critical distinguishing features of the present study from the past reports. We identified the CCM of Tissue Genesis, Inc., HI as the suitable hardware system to carry out the experiment in the spaceflight. CCM is an automated, feedback controlled module that can concurrently support 24 bioreactors following protocols exclusively programmed for individual bioreactor. For this experiment we use samples EA41, EA 47, EA45, and EA155 that were exposed to LPS for 4 hours. Samples EA123, EA165, EA127, EA126 were exposed to LPS for 8Hrs. Samples EA33, EA 125, EA79 and EA 39 were controls in this experiment.",
