          "Study Protocol Description": "Within 4 hours of splashdown, flight and ground control animals were sacrificed and brains were removed and dissected. For the study focusing on the forebrain, microdissections of the entire hippocampus and primary motor cortex were performed following well-established rodent brain microdissection protocols, and a brain atlas served as a reference to ensure accuracy of brain region identification. Following brain dissection, samples were stored at −80 degrees Celsius until further analysis. Tissues used in this study consisted of the brain hippocampus. Brain tissue samples were obtained from by the authors through an award from the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection (NBISC).     C57BL/6 female mice (16-week-old, Jackson Labs) were flown to the ISS as part of NASA’s 1st RR-1 on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft. During flight, animals were kept at an ambient temperature of 26 to 28C in a 12-hour light and dark cycle. Flight animals received water and a food bar diet specifically designed by NASA ad libitum. RR-1 mission animals were on board of the Dragon capsule for 4 days (transit time) and then spent 37 days in the ISS. Animals in the vivarium group were control animals that were housed under standard laboratory conditions. In addition, animals in the baseline group consisted of mice from the same cohorts as the flight mice that were sacrificed at the time of launch.     Using protein lysates, a V-PLEX ECLIA kit (MSD) was used to measure the inflammatory profile in the different brain sections using the MESO-QuickPlex SQ-120MM (MSD).     Briefly, to measure the protein levels of TNF-alpha, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70 and IL-10, after washing steps, the plate was incubated overnight with 50 uL of samples. The following day, after washing steps, samples were incubated in detection antibody for 2 hrs followed by 3 more washings steps and addition of 2X Read Buffer. After obtaining the quantity of protein in pg/mL using using the MESO-QuickPlex SQ-120MM, samples were then normalized to total protein loaded.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining. The transformed column headers and the submitted term from which they derive are defined in the study data dictionary file.",

Flight animals received water and a food bar diet specifically designed by NASA ad libitum. RR-1 mission animals were on board of the Dragon capsule for 4 days (transit time) and then spent 37 days in the ISS. Animals were kept in similar conditions to flight animals (ambient temperature of 26 to 28 degrees C in a 12-hour light and dark cycle). Telemetry data (with a 4-day delay) from the flight group was used to keep the ground control animals under similar conditions (housed in RR-1 flight hardware within an environmental simulator under the same conditions as the ISS). Water and food conditions were the same as to the flight animal group as described above. Animals in the vivarium group were control animals that were housed under standard laboratory conditions. In addition, animals in the baseline group consisted of mice from the same cohorts as the flight mice that were sacrificed at the time of launch.     Within 4 hours of splashdown, flight and ground control animals were sacrificed and brains were removed and dissected. For the study focusing on the forebrain, microdissections of the entire hippocampus and primary motor cortex were performed following well-established rodent brain microdissection protocols, and a brain atlas served as a reference to ensure accuracy of brain region identification. Following brain dissection, samples were stored at −80 degrees Celsius until further analysis. Tissues used in this study consisted of brain tissue, minus the cortex and hippocampus. Brain tissue samples were obtained from by the authors through an award from the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection (NBISC).     Brain lysates were run and resolved in 4–20% Criterion TGX Stain-Free precast gels (Bio-Rad) at 300V.     Samples were transferred via a TransBlot turbo using a PVDF transfer membrane. The transfer lasted seven minutes in duration.     All membranes were blocked using I-Block overnight at four degrees Celsius.     Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against caspase-1 (Novus Biologicals), ASC (Santa Cruz), IL-1beta (Cell Signaling) at a dilution of 1:1000. b-actin (Sigma Aldric) was used as a standard and protein loading control.     Membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies against caspase-1 (Novus Biologicals), ASC (Santa Cruz), IL-1beta (Cell Signaling) at a dilution of 1:1000. b-actin (Sigma Aldric) was used as a standard and protein loading control. All primary antibodies used a mouse antigen host and underwent two five minute washes with I-Block at room temperature.     All secondary Anti-Mouse HRP antibodies used a goat antigen host. The membranes then underwent one five minute wash and two ten minute washes with I-Block at room temperature.     The western Blots were imaged through chemilluminescence for one minute using the ChemiDoc Touch Gel Imaging System.     The Western Blots were quantified using the Silk Scientific Corporation UN- SCAN-IT gel software.     Each image contains the twenty sample lanes labeled left to right: Vivarium 1 (M16), Ground 1 (M36), Baseline 1 (M6), Flight 1 (M26), Vivarium 2 (M17), Ground 2 (M37), Baseline 2 (M7), Flight 2 (M27), Vivarium 3 (M18), Ground 3 (M38), Baseline 3 (M8) , Flight 3 (M28), Vivarium 4 (M19), Ground 4 (M39), Baseline 4 (M9), Flight 4 (M29), Vivarium 5 (M20), Ground 5 (M40), Baseline 5 (M10), Flight 5 (M30).

          "Study Protocol Description": "16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Labs) were were transported to the ISS by SpaceX-4 on September 21, 2014 and were subjected to microgravity for 37 days before being euthanized on-orbit. Mice were housed in the Rodent Habitat with wire floors on a 12-hour light cycle, and were given daily video health checks. Mice from the same cohort were used for ground controls, which were housed on a 4-day delay in identical hardware under ISS environmental conditions (12-hour light cycle, temperature and humidity) inside an environmental simulator (ISSES) at the Space Life Science Laboratory (SLSL) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Vivarium mice were housed in the standard vivarium cages for the same amount of time as spaceflight and ground control animals. Additionally, a group of mice from the same cohort as flight and ground controls were used as a basal control, which were euthanized the day after launch for use as a baseline reference. All mice were fed Standard Chow (LabDiet5K52) and given deionized water via sipper tubes before being acclimated to NASA Nutrient Upgraded Rodent Food Bar (NuRFB) and lixits for flight. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     The flight group mice were euthanized by ISS crew with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation. Mice M21 and M22 were partially dissected, and the dissected carcasses were frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C). For the remaining 8 mice, the carcasses were wrapped in foil and frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C) and brought back to Earth where dissection was held. Ground control mice M31 and M32 followed the same protocol of on-orbit dissected animals (M21 and M22). Post-flight, carcasses were thawed and dissected twice. All mouse carcasses, including partially dissected and intact carcasses, were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes. Total dissection time for each carcass was no longer than 30 minutes since collection of the first tissue. Right  Femurs were harvested during the first dissection, stored separately overnight at 4 C in RNAlater, then transferred into a -20 C freezer. Vertebrae were dissected in the second session, wrapped in foil, and stored at -20 C.     The right femur from each sample was scanned using Bruker SkyScan 1272 microCT (Kontich, Belgium). Scans were performed at 60 kV of x-ray energy with a 0.25 mm thick aluminum filter. Images were taken every 0.5 degrees and averaged over 3 frames. Scans using the SkyScan 1272 were conducted at 0.6 um for the femoral head, 3 um for the femur, and 4 um for vertebrae. Tomographies were reconstructed with Bruker SkyScan NRecon software and the Instarecon reconstruction server (Instarecon Inc., Urbana Illinois) using a ring artifact correction of 10, and a beam hardening correction of 40%.     Reconstructed microCT images of the femur were uploaded to DataViewer software (Bruker SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium), and reoriented in two parts; one where the z-axis was concentrically aligned with the midshaft and distal epiphysis, and one where the z-axis was concentrically aligned with the femoral neck. Vertebrae were oriented so both lateral pedicles were parallel. Appropriate orientation was confirmed and visualized in 3D using CTVox software (Bruker SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium).\nFixed dimension volumes of interest (VOIs) were selected, and bone regions were segmented using CTAn software (Bruker SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium) for each of the five selected sites. For the L2 vertebrae, a cancellous VOI of 0.6 mm was isolated, extending from the caudal growth plate to its connection with the lateral pedicles. The femoral head was analyzed with a cancellous VOI of 0.4 mm, defined by the tissue between the end of the metaphyseal growth plate and start of the cortical femoral neck. In the femoral neck, a cortical VOI of 0.14 mm segmented the tissue connecting the end of the femoral head region to the femoral shaft. The femoral midshaft was analyzed with a cortical VOI of 0.48 mm, determined by averaging the z-position of the proximal and distal ends of the femur. Lastly, the distal femoral epiphysis had a cancellous VOI of 1.12 mm, extending from the epiphyseal growth plate towards the midshaft.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining",

          "Study Description": "Exposure to weightlessness in microgravity and elevated space radiation are associated with rapid bone loss in mammals, but questions remain about their mechanisms of action and relative importance. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bone loss during spaceflight in Low Earth Orbit is primarily associated with site-specific microgravity unloading of weight-bearing sites in the skeleton. Microcomputed tomography and histological analyses of bones from mice space flown on ISS for 37 days in the NASA Rodent Research-1 experiment show significant site-specific cancellous and cortical bone loss occurring in the femur, but not in L2 vertebrae. The lack of bone degenerative effects in the spine in combination with same-animal paired losses in the femur suggests that space radiation levels in Low Earth Orbit or other systemic stresses are not likely to significantly contribute to the observed bone loss. Remarkably, spaceflight is also associated with accelerated progression of femoral head endochondral ossification. This suggests the microgravity environment promotes premature progression of secondary ossification during late stages of skeletal maturation at 21 weeks. Furthermore, mice housed in the NASA ISS Rodent Habitat during 1g ground controls maintained or gained bone relative to mice housed in standard vivarium cages that showed significant bone mass declines. These findings suggest that housing in the Rodent Habitat with greater topological enrichment from 3D wire-mesh surfaces may promote increased mechanical loading of weight-bearing bones and maintenance of bone mass. In summary, our results indicate that in female mice approaching skeletal maturity, mechanical unloading of weight-bearing sites is the major cause of bone loss in microgravity, while sites loaded predominantly by muscle activity, such as the spine, appear unaffected. Additionally, we identified early-onset of femoral head epiphyseal plate secondary ossification as a novel spaceflight skeletal unloading effect that may lead to premature long bone growth arrest in microgravity. This study derives results from femur and vertebrae using the micro computed tomography assay.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "In the Rodent Research Reference Mission (RRRM-1), forty female BALB/cAnNTac mice were flown on the International Space Station. To assess differences in outcomes due to age, twenty 10-12 week-old and twenty 32 week-old mice were flown, respectively. To directly assess spaceflight effects, half of the young and old mice (10 old, 10 young) were sacrificed on-orbit after 22-23 days (ISS Terminal, ISS-T), while the other half (10 old, 10 young) were returned live to Earth after 40 days and allowed to recover for 2 days (Live Animal Return, LAR) before sacrifice. Both the ISS-T and LAR animals had independent ground controls (10 mice housed in flight hardware in matched environmental conditions), basal controls (10 mice sacrificed 1 day after launch), and vivarium controls (10 mice housed within standard vivarium habitats). Thus RRRM-1 included a total of 160 mice. All mice (BALB/cAnNTac) were sourced from Taconic Biosciences (Germantown, NY). Mice were weighed, chipped with BMDS RFID chip (IMI-500) and shipped to NASA KSC for delivery at approximately L-4 weeks. Mice were housed and maintained in the Animal Care Facility (ACF) at NASA KSC with 12:12 light cycle matched in timing to the light cycle used for Transporters and Habitats programmed for flight. All mice were housed in cages of 5 mice/cage with the same littermates as they had been raised. Mice were initially given ad lib standard lab chow and water, which was changed on a schedule of 2x per week. Mice were housed initially on standard bedding and provided igloo-type enrichment. Animal health was checked daily by appropriately trained NASA personnel and contracted lab technicians. At L-3 weeks, mice were placed on raised mesh flooring to simulate spaceflight Transporter and Habitat cage conditions, given water delivered through lixits identical to those used in the flight hardware and put on the NASA Nutrient-Upgraded Rodent Foodbars (NuRFB). Food and water was changed weekly and mice were weighed bi-weekly. Igloo-type enrichment was provided in all cages. At L-10 days, mice were grouped (10 mice per cage) in larger cages for social acclimation prior to launch. Groupings were done based on age of animals and with regard to establishing similar average weights between any given grouping. At L-2 days, baseline, spaceflight and ground control groups were identified. At L-1 day, spaceflight animals were loaded into spaceflight Transporters. Habitat Ground Control (HGC) mice were loaded into Transporters on a 3-day offset from spaceflight animals. Vivarium Ground Control (VGC) mice (also on a 3-day offset) were returned to 5 mice/cage and placed on standard bedding and provided water through typical sipper tubes at launch equivalent. All mice were maintained on NuRFB throughout the duration of the study. Spaceflight and HGC mice were given new food at weekly intervals. VGC mice were given new food and fresh water also on weekly intervals. Mold contamination of food: Spaceflight and Habitat Ground Control mice were exposed to mold in their food to unknown relative degrees. The Vivarium Control and Baseline Control mice had clean food throughout their habitation. Loose food bars: Food bars came loose and fell to the bottom of the cage for the HGC mice and was free floating for the Spaceflight mice. This did not prevent the mice from eating. This may have caused some degree of stress for these animals that would have been experienced differently between the Spaceflight and HGC groups. Live animal return: Because weather in the Pacific was very poor, mice experienced double density housing (10 per cage instead of 5) for at least 7 days instead of the expected 2-3 days. Habitat Ground Control mice were treated the same way but this duration of double-density housing probably created additional stress on both groups of mice. In addition, because of rough seas, the Spaceflight mice might have experienced some sea sickness-type conditions that would not have been experienced by the HGC mice. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     Femoral skin samples from 35 young (∼10-16 weeks) female BALB/cAnNTac mice (Taconic Biosciences) were obtained through the International Space Station (ISS) National Laboratory’s Biospecimen Sharing Program, and no live animals were involved in this study. These mice belonged to the SpaceX CRS-16 Rodent Research-8 mission [also known as Rodent Research Reference Mission-1 (RRRM-1)] were procured from ISS National Laboratory in collaboration with Dr. Liz Warren. The detailed information regarding the RRRM-1 mission is available through ISS laboratory’s Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS) research archive (www.iss-casis.org/research-on-the-iss/solicitations/2018-rodent-research/). Briefly, this study investigated skin samples from 17 mice that were flown to space [10 euthanized on-orbit after 22-23 days; 7 euthanized post-landing (40 days in space and allowed to recover for 2 days before sacrifice) and 18 mice age-matched ground control animals. Data from 10 spaceflight animals (5 euthanized on-orbit after 22-23 days; 5 euthanized post-landing (40 days in space and allowed to recover for 2 days before sacrifice) and 6 age-matched ground control animals are deposited in these datasets.     Live Animal Return (LAR) samples: Mice were anesthetized with gas anesthesia and euthanized by means of cardiac puncture blood draw (exsanguination) and double thoracotomy. Fecal samples and other tissues were removed and preserved using liquid nitrogen after euthanasia. All groups (baseline, flight, habitat and vivarium ground controls) were treated identically. All samples were maintained at -80C or lower temperatures throughout the storage during transportation and shipment. ISS Terminal (ISS-T) samples: Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and euthanized by means of cardiac puncture blood draw (exsanguination) and double thoracotomy. The carcass was then wrapped in foil and frozen in MELFI on board the ISS or in ground -80C freezers. Carcasses were maintained at -80C or lower temperatures throughout the storage on board the ISS, in ground freezers and during transportation and shipment. For fecal sample collection, carcasses were thawed at room temperature one at a time (staggered) until the tissues were sufficiently pliable for dissection (approximately 60-90 minutes). Once thawed, tissues were removed from each carcass and preserved using liquid nitrogen. All samples were maintained at -80C or lower temperatures throughout the storage in ground freezers and during transportation and shipment.     RRBS analysis was performed using Diagenode Epigenomics Services (Diagenode, Cat  G02020000) on total DNA isolated from murine skin samples using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Cat  69504) as per manufacturer’s instructions. The Quantity and sample integrity assessment of DNA starting material were determined via 4200 TapeStation system (Agilent). Genomic DNA was treated with RNase Cocktail (Invitrogen, Cat  AM2288) for 30min at 37C to remove contaminating small RNAs. Following the treatment, the DNA was purified using a 2x beads:sample ratio of Agencourt AmpureXP beads (Beckman Coulter). DNA concentration was measured using the Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and quality was assessed with the Fragment Analyzer and the DNF-488 High Sensitivity genomic DNA Analysis Kit (Agilent).     RRBS libraries were prepared using the Premium Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) Kit (Diagenode Cat  C02030033). 100ng of genomic DNA were used to start library preparation. Following library preparation, samples were pooled together. PCR clean-up after the final library amplification was performed using a 1.45x beads:sample ratio of Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter).     RRBS library pools were sequenced on a NovaSeq6000 (Illumina) using 50 bp paired-end read sequencing (PE50).     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.     For targeted RNA sequencing, total RNA was extracted using ABI Picopure RNA isolation kit and quality assessment was performed using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.     The paired-end library was prepared with 30-200ng of RNA using Agilent SureSelect Custom cDNA Conversion Module, plus SSEL XTHS reagent Kit with Mouse All Exon V2 (67.1Mb).     Sequencing was performed using NovaSeq 6000 S2 kit on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform with a read length of 100bp.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of Mus-musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 13-May-2024.",

          "Study Description": "Genomic plasticity helps adapt to extreme environmental conditions. We tested the hypothesis that exposure to space environment (ESE) impacts the epigenome inducing genomic plasticity. Murine skin samples from the Rodent Research Reference Mission-1 were procured from the International Space Station (ISS) National Laboratory. Targeted RNA sequencing to test differential gene expression between the skin of ESE versus ground controls revealed upregulation of VEGF-mediated angiogenesis pathways secondary to promoter hypomethylation in responders. Methylome sequencing identified ESE-sensitive hypomethylated genes including developmental angiogenic genes Araf, Vegfb, and Vegfr1. Based on differentially expressed genes, the angiogenesis biofunction was enriched in responders. The induction of genomic plasticity in response to ESE, as reported herein, may be viewed as a mark of biological resilience that is evident in a minority of organisms, responders but not in non-responders, exposed to the same stressor. Inducible genomic plasticity may be implicated in natural resilience to ESE. GeneLab Note: at the time of releasing this dataset, the associated publication has a typo throughout where RRRM-1 samples are incorrectly said to be flown on SpaceX-19 (should be SpaceX-16). The corresponding authors were contacted and it was verified to be an error. They have alerted the publisher of the error and will be making a correction to the publication at some point. As a result, all information in the present study has been curated using the correct mission record for the RRRM-1 payload (SpaceX-16).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "In the Rodent Research Reference Mission (RRRM-2), forty female C57BL/6NTac mice were flown on the International Space Station. To assess differences in outcomes due to age, twenty 12 week-old and twenty 29 week-old mice were flown, respectively. To directly assess spaceflight effects, half of the young and old mice (10 old, 10 young) were sacrificed on-orbit after 55-58 days (ISS Terminal, ISS-T), while the other half (10 old, 10 young) were returned live to Earth after 3 days and allowed to recover for 24 days (Live Animal Return, LAR) before sacrifice. ISS-T and LAR mice were the same age at sacrifice.  Both the ISS-T and LAR animals had independent ground controls (10 mice per group housed in flight hardware in matched environmental conditions), basal controls (10 mice per group sacrificed 2 days before launch), and vivarium controls (10 mice per group housed within standard vivarium habitats). Thus RRRM-2 included a total of 160 mice. All mice (C57BL/6NTac) were sourced from Taconic Biosciences (Germantown, NY). Mice were weighed, chipped with BMDS RFID chip (IMI-500) and shipped to NASA KSC for delivery at approximately L-5 weeks. Mice were housed and maintained in the Animal Care Facility (ACF) at NASA KSC with 12:12 light cycle matched in timing to the light cycle used for Transporters and Habitats programmed for flight. All mice were housed in cages of 5 mice/cage with the same littermates as they had been raised. Mice were initially given ad lib standard lab chow and water, which was changed on a schedule of 2x per week. Mice were housed initially on standard bedding and provided igloo-type enrichment. Animal health was checked daily by appropriately trained NASA personnel and contracted lab technicians. At L-4 weeks, mice were placed on raised mesh flooring to simulate spaceflight Transporter and Habitat cage conditions, given water delivered through lixits identical to those used in the flight hardware and put on the NASA Nutrient-Upgraded Rodent Foodbars (NuRFB). Food and water were changed weekly, and mice were weighed bi-weekly. Igloo-type enrichment was provided in all cages. At L-12 days, mice were grouped (10 mice per cage) in larger cages for social acclimation prior to launch. Groupings were done based on age of animals and in a manner to establish similar average weights between any given grouping. At L-2 days, baseline, spaceflight and ground control groups were identified. At L-1 day, spaceflight animals were loaded into spaceflight Transporters. Habitat Ground Control (HGC) mice were loaded into Transporters on a 3-day offset from spaceflight animals. Vivarium Ground Control (VGC) mice (also on a 3-day offset) were returned to 5 mice/cage and placed on standard bedding and provided water through typical sipper tubes at launch equivalent. All mice were maintained on NuRFB throughout the duration of the study. Spaceflight and HGC mice were given new food at weekly intervals. VGC mice were given new food and fresh water also on weekly intervals. After splashdown, flight LAR mice were transferred to the animal care facility at Scripps Research Institute where they were assessed and re-caged into standard caging conditions (5 mice/cage, standard bedding and ad lib water from regular sipper tubes).  LAR and ISS-T Ground Control mice were shipped from Kennedy Space Center to Scripps and housed under the same conditions as the flight mice. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     Live Animal Return (LAR): Mice were anesthetized with gas anesthesia and euthanized by means of cardiac puncture blood draw (exsanguination) and double thoracotomy. Tissues removed, weighed, if appropriate, and snap frozen on liquid nitrogen. Tissues were frozen within 10-25 minutes of the thoracotomy procedure. All groups (baseline, flight, habitat and vivarium ground controls) were treated identically. Tissues were maintained at -80C or lower temperatures throughout the storage during transportation and shipment. ISS Terminal (ISS-T) liver samples: Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and euthanized by means of cardiac puncture blood draw (exsanguination) and double thoracotomy. The right eye, heart, spleen, left lateral liver lobe, right kidney/adrenal gland, spleen and right hindlimb (hip to foot, skin removed) were dissected fresh from each carcass and placed in tubes or sample bags containing a minimum of 5:1 volume of RNA Later to tissue.  These tissues were allowed to equilibrate for 48 hours at 4C and then frozen in MELFI to less than -80C for long-term storage. GeneLab only processed 20/20/20/20 samples from FLT/BSL/VGC/HGC groups in this dataset, 10 ISS-T and LAR animals in each group.     The kidneys were cut in half along the coronal plane, and one half was further cut into three sections, each containing parts of the cortex, renal pyramid structure, calyx, arteries, and veins (i.e. cutting from the outer cortex towards the renal pelvis). The middle section was taken and processed through RNA/DNA extraction. A diagram illustrating this process is included as supplemental material in this study.  RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following GeneLab SOP 3.1-Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini with Qiagen RNase-Free DNase set. Homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 24 mg of tissue was isolated using a scalpel, weighed, and immediately placed in 750 µL of the Buffer RLT solution. Homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix Navy RINO Lysis Kit 1.5mL, (Next Advance, Raymertown, NY) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance, Raymertown, NY) for 3 minutes at 4 ˚C per SOP 2.1-Tissue homogenization Using Bullet Blender Gold Bead Beater. Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 minutes at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 µL RNAse free H2O, and DNA was eluted in 50 µL RNAse free H2O. Concentration for all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR kit following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat 4456739, v92), Mix 1 or Mix 2, were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol. SOP 5.2 Use of ERCC Spike-In Mixes and UMRR/UHRR Controls for Total RNA Sequencing. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA ribo depletion and library preparation was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) following GeneLab SOP 5.1 Ilumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Lirary Prep using epMotion. Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN greater than 6.1. Index adapters used were at 1.5 µM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit. Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scentific, Waltham, MA) following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as following: Read 1: 149bp, Index1: 17bp, Index2: 8bp Read 2: 149bp. 1% PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) were incorporated into the read headers of raw fastq files using UMI-tools version 1.1.2. Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on May-2024. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.1 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.1/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0), ERCC genes were removed, and the non-ERCC genes were normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis_GLbulkRNAseq.html report.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Twenty (20) mice (male, C57BL/6J, 16-17 weeks old) were launched in one Transporter on SpaceX-21 (SpX-21) on December 6, 2020. The Flight mice were transferred into two Rodent Habitats upon arrival to the International Space Station (ISS) and were maintained in microgravity for 38 days. The Flight mice were transferred into a Transporter and returned to Earth for Live Animal Return (LAR) on SpX-21 (January 13th, 2021). The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol (Protocol number RR-23) was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     After Atlantic Ocean splashdown, the LAR Flight mice were transported via helicopter to Kennedy Space Center. Collectively, 20 Flight, 20 HGC, and 20 VGC mice were transferred from Rodent Transporters (Flight and HGC) or vivarium cages (VGC) and placed into shipping containers.  All 60 mice were flown via charter plane to the PI’s institution, Texas A and M University (TAMU).  All post-flight euthanasia and dissections were performed by the PI team at TAMU. The original plan was to perform all pre-flight and post-flight activities at Roskamp Institute in Sarasota, Florida.  Due to the health risks associated with travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, HRP approved all post-flight activities at TAMU, which significantly decreased or eliminated travel for the PI, BSP, and Payload Developer (PD) teams. Upon arrival at the TAMU Animal Care Facility (ACF), the mice underwent post-flight procedures, followed by euthanasia and tissue collection by the PI team. GeneLab only processed 9/9/9 samples from the Flight(FLT)/Habitat Ground Control(HGC)/Vivarium Ground Control(VIV) groups in this dataset.     RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Universal Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Approximately 10 mg of tissue was used, weighed, and immediately placed in 700 µL of the QIAzol buffer solution. Homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix SSB14B, a mix of stainless steel beads of 0.9-2.0mm (Next Advance, Raymertown, NY) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance, Raymertown, NY) for 5 minutes at 4 ˚C, speed of 12 per SOP 2.1-Tissue homogenization Using Bullet Blender Gold Bead Beater. Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 minutes at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 30 µL RNAse free H2O.

          "Study Description": "The objective of the Rodent Research-23 mission (RR-23) was to better understand the effects of spaceflight on the eyes, specifically on the structure and function of the arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels that are needed to maintain vision. To this end, twenty male, C57BL/6J, 16-17 weeks-old mice were delivered to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX-21 in a single transporter, transferred to two rodent habitats, and maintained in microgravity for 38 days. Flight mice were then returned to Earth alive (January 13th, 2021). After splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean, mice were transported to Kennedy Space Center via helicopter. The 20 Flight (FLT), 20 Habitat Ground Control (GC), and 20 Vivarium Ground Control (VIV) mice were removed from Rodent Transporters (FLT and GC) or vivarium cages (VIV), placed into shipping containers, and flown to Texas A and M University. There, mice underwent post-flight procedures, before euthanasia and tissue collection. FLT, GC and VIV animals were euthanized and dissected on Jan 14th, 17th or 20th of 2021, respectively. Soleus muscle samples were preserved by immersion in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C until RNA was extracted, and libraries generated and sequenced (target 60 M clusters per sample, PE 149 bp). This dataset features 9 samples from the Flight group, 9 samples from the Habitat Ground Control group, and 9 samples from the Vivarium Ground Control group.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "24 male 12-week old C57BL/6 mice, were launched from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-27 (Dragon) on March 15th, 2023, for a 30-day MHU-8 mission. The animals were housed in the JAXA Habitat Cages Units (HCU) located in the Kibo centrifuge hardware Cell Biology Experimental Facility on ISS. The 24 flight mice were subdivided into four groups. The first group of flight mice (n equals 6) were exposed to ambient microgravity conditions (MG group), the second and third groups of flight mice (n equals 6) were exposed to continuous AG of 0.33G and 0.67G respectively, and the fourth group was exposed to continuous 1G. AG was achieved through the use of a short-arm centrifuge for the duration of their stay on the ISS. The rotation rate for generating 0.33G, 0.67G, and 1.0G were 44 rpm, 63 rpm, and 77 rpm, respectively. The flight mice were then splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean on April 15, 2023 and returned to Earth alive. 12 Habitat Ground Control (HGC) mice were maintained in similar habitat conditions as the FLT mice exposed to 1G, inside the ISSES Chambers of operations conducted with a 3-day delay. The spaceflight mice were then euthanized and their eyes were removed and prepared for analysis. All mice received the same ad libitum access to food and water. Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Tsukuba, Explora Biolabs, JAXA and NASA. No protocol was required from The Loma Linda University (LLU) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), since only archived frozen and fixed tissues were obtained after euthanasia. The research with vertebrate animals was done in strict accordance with guidelines and applicable laws in Japan and the United States of America.     Within 6 hours of splashing down, mice were euthanized and their eyes were harvested. The left eyes from each experimental group were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. The retina and optic nerve of the right eyes were dissected out from the eye globe and placed individually in sterile cryovials, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80C prior to use.     RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Universal kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following manufacturer protocol. QIAzol was used as homogenization buffer and was kept on ice until use. MHU-8 optic nerve tissues processed in this experiment were not weighted before extractions to avoid thaw and cold QIAzol homogenization buffer was added directly into the tissue tubes. Homogenization was performed using rotor stator homogenizer (Polytron, Raymertown, NY), 3 repetitions of 10 seconds each at speed of 21,000 per SOP 2.2-Tissue homogenization Using Polytron Rotor Stator Homogenizer (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs). Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 minutes at RT and 14,000g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 40uL RNAse free H2O. Concentration for all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR or HS kits following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). RNA integrity number equivalent (RINe) values are reported     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat 4456739, v92), Mix 1 or Mix 2, were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol. SOP 5.2 Use of ERCC Spike-In Mixes and UMRR/UHRR Controls for Total RNA Sequencing (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs).     RNA ribo depletion and library preparation was done with Illumina Stranded Total RNA Prep with Ribo-Zero Plus (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Input RNA was approximately 100nG with RIN greater than 4. Sample FLT11, FLT21, FLT04, FLT23, FLT12, FLT02 and HGC05 input was below 30ng. Unique dual index adapters (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) were used, and 12 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs). Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scentific, Waltham, MA) following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs). Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as following: Read 1: 151 bp, Index1: 17 bp, Index2: 8 bp Read 2: 151 bp. PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs).     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to reverse. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.22.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.8.4), PANTHER.db (v1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (v3.15.0).     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of Mus-musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.4/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. The data were normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor*. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis.html report. *ERCC-normalized data are available upon request.",

          "Study Description": "The development of eye pathology is a serious concern for astronauts that spend time in deep space. Microgravity is a major component of the spaceflight environment, which could have adverse effects on ocular health. The use of centrifugation to restore partial or Earth-like gravity in space is a possible countermeasure to mitigate the effects of microgravity on the eye. Therefore, we subjected mice on the International Space Station (ISS) to artificial gravity by centrifugation at 0, 0.33, 0.67, and 1G, and then performed RNA-seq on optic nerve and retinal tissue after returning them to Earth alive. We find that the microgravity environment induces transcriptomic changes in the optic nerve and retina consistent with an increased oxidative stress load, inflammation, apoptosis, and lipid metabolic stress. Adding artificial gravity on board the ISS can attenuate the transcriptomic response to microgravity in a dose-dependent manner. Such attenuation may effectively mitigate spaceflight-induced detrimental effects on ocular tissue. This study hosts optic nerve data, and OSD-758 hosts retina data.",

Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to reverse. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.22.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.8.4), PANTHER.db (v1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (v3.15.0).     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of Mus-musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.4/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. The data were normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor*. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis.html report. *ERCC-normalized data are available upon request.",

          "Study Description": "The development of eye pathology is a serious concern for astronauts that spend time in deep space. Microgravity is a major component of the spaceflight environment, which could have adverse effects on ocular health. The use of centrifugation to restore partial or Earth-like gravity in space is a possible countermeasure to mitigate the effects of microgravity on the eye. Therefore, we subjected mice on the International Space Station (ISS) to artificial gravity by centrifugation at 0, 0.33, 0.67, and 1G, and then performed RNA-seq on optic nerve and retinal tissue after returning them to Earth alive. We find that the microgravity environment induces transcriptomic changes in the optic nerve and retina consistent with an increased oxidative stress load, inflammation, apoptosis, and lipid metabolic stress. Adding artificial gravity on board the ISS can attenuate the transcriptomic response to microgravity in a dose-dependent manner. Such attenuation may effectively mitigate spaceflight-induced detrimental effects on ocular tissue. This study hosts retina data, and OSD-759 hosts optic nerve data.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "A cohort of sixteen-week-old female C57BL/6J (Jackson Laboratory) were flown to the ISS, housed in the Rodent Habitat and were subjected to microgravity for 37-38 days. Mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls (GC) housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. Mice were fed Standard Chow (LabDiet5K52), then Nutrient Upgraded Rodent Food Bar (NuRFB). Deionized water was provided ad libitum from sipper tubes, then lixit spouts. The mice were given a 12:12 hour light/dark cycle (lights on: 0600–1800 GMT). Daily video health checks were given for the mice. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     The mouse carcasses were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes. Multiple tissues were collected from each carcass. Total dissection time for each carcass was no longer than 30 minutes since collection of the first tissue. After harvesting, Quadriceps femoris muscle was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, then transferred into a -80 C freezer.     Each trial was taken with a new cantilever to ensure tip health between trials. All pre-mechanical checks were completed before testing, including consistent summation of the laser and consistent calibration before each micrograph was taken. The AFM was left to warm for approximately 1-2 hours prior to testing. Under no circumstance was any equipment changed in between trials. This included frosted cantilever mounts, cantilever mounting screws, optical microscopes, and AFM heads.     All images were taken in quantitative imaging mode. The parameters were unchanged throughout the experiments to reduce the possibility of bias or differing values for data analysis. Humidity was 30% (+/-5%) for all trials and room temperature was 23-26°C.     12-24 hours prior to testing, samples were removed from the -80°C freezer and thawed in PBS (Fischer Scientific Catalog: BP399500) at 4°C. Once the tissue was thawed, a series of hand washes were done to minimize the amount of debris potentially adhered to the sample. Samples were then treated in a Trypsin treatment (.05g/15mL extraction medium) to promote fluffing of the collagen. The extraction medium consisted of a pH 7.5-8.0 0.1M Tris-HCl stock solution, in addition to EDTA and deionized (DI) water. pH tuning was not needed for this study; however, the protocol stated the use of NaOH (if needed). Washed/treated sample were placed into a deep plastic well and longitudinal cuts were made using a razor blade (Fischer Scientific Catalog: 22-444-264) superficially to disrupt the endotenon. The consequent outlets made from the cuts allowed the chemical treatment to act on the collagen while degrading the outer fascia not needed for mechanical testing. With the tissue fully enlarged from the chemical treatments, the tissues were pulled apart into a thin sheet across the plastic well. Pulling apart of the sheet longitudinally into two identically sized/smaller sheets left a barren space in between for fibril pooling.\n\nAll samples were kept hydrated under deionized water during mechanical testing. Any samples that dried due to the optical microscopes stage light during fibril visualization were not included in this work. Focused scans for each trial were done without the stage light on to minimize dehydration due to external heat on the samples.     All micrographs were taken with 512x512px resolution. Survey scans in were taken through a 10x10 um region, followed by a 1x1um scan region for focused scans. Suspected fibrils were centered around the middle of the scan region and rotated to ensure non-diagonal scans for the cantilever. This was done to prevent smearing and scarring.\n\nMicrographs were processed via the JPK data processing software in order to export data-fit and data-image files that were later used for morphological and force data analysis. For analysis, Gwyddion is used to collect mean, max and targeted data from processed micrographs. Leveling of the glass slide and the removal of debris was done on all processed micrographs to ensure that non-collagen material was left out of the file data export. The data was then exported to Excel and SPSS for statistical analysis between spaceflight and ground control groups.\n\nWithin the raw and processed data files, the sample file names are written in the format ‘RR1_qi_M30QUL2_SF4BIOAC_1’, where: RR1 equals Rodent Research 1, qi equals Quantitative Imaging Mode, M29 equals NASA Animal Source Name/Vial Name, QU equals Quadricep/Left1 or Left2, GF/SF equals Ground Control or Spaceflight, 1-6 equals Trial Number, BIOAC equals cantilever tip, and the final number represents the image/replicate number. Within the Processed Data Files folder, files ending with an m.gwy or f.gwy indicate a morphology (m) or force (f) curve file. Please refer to the accompanying ReadME document  for further details about the file types.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining. Specifically, from four originally supplied excel files, data from the first tabs were combined and aligned in a .csv file. All mouse sample names and accompanying stats were realigned in the process; duplicate rows and formatting was removed in the final .csv file.",

          "Study Description": "Collagen is an essential component of connective tissue and plays a crucial role in elasticity, stability, and force distribution. While the adaptations of tendon to internal stimuli have been extensively researched, the impact of environmental factors (such as microgravity) on its structure and function at the nanoscopic scale (i.e., fibril level) remains largely unexplored. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of 32 days (d) aboard the International Space Station (ISS) on murine tendon collagen fibril morphology and nanomechanics (Young’s Modulus, YM). Quadriceps tendon samples from 16wk old female C57BL/6J mice aboard NASA Rodent Research-1 underwent chemical processing and mechanical isolation. Subsequently, collagen fibrils (n equals 38) were studied via atomic force microscopy (AFM, JPK NanoWizard 4a) to compare the morphology (diameter, height) and nanomechanics (average YM) between spaceflight (SF) and ground control (GC) mouse tendon samples. The qp-BioAC-CB1 cantilever (spring constant: 0.3 N/m, tip radius: 10µm) was used under quantitative imaging mode (Qi) for all force and morphological measurements. The data from 17 micrographs (SF n equals 23; GC n equals 15) was processed via the JPK Data Processing Software (Version 6.4.5.), and finally analyzed via Gwyddion (Version 2.62). To our knowledge, this is the first investigation to use AFM QI-mode on tendon collagen fibrils after spaceflight. Mean fibril size and YM were similar between SF and GC mouse tendon fibrils after 32 days of space flight; these results suggest that collagen fibrils may require more time to adapt to changes in their environment, and/or more rapid changes may take place at different levels of the collagen hierarchy. This data provides valuable insights into mammalian tissue adaptations during spaceflight, and future research should continue these investigations with longer-duration missions to build a time-course of tendon adaptations to microgravity. All results derived are from atomic force microscopy using quadriceps femoris tendon tissue.",

Subsequently, collagen fibrils (n equals 17) were studied via atomic force microscopy (AFM, JPK NanoWizard 4a) to compare the morphology (diameter, height) and nanomechanics (average YM) between spaceflight (SF) and ground control (GC) mouse tendon samples. The qp-BioAC-CB1 cantilever (spring constant: 0.3 N/m, tip radius: 10µm) was used under quantitative imaging mode (Qi) for all force and morphological measurements. The data from 17 micrographs (SF n equals 5; GC n equals 12) was processed via the JPK Data Processing Software (Version 6.4.5.), and finally analyzed via Gwyddion (Version 2.62). To our knowledge, this is the first investigation to use AFM QI-mode on tendon collagen fibrils after spaceflight. Mean fibril size and YM were similar between Space Flight (SF) and Ground Control (GC) mouse tendon fibrils after 32 days of space flight; these results suggest that collagen fibrils may require more time to adapt to changes in their environment, and/or more rapid changes may take place at different levels of the collagen hierarchy. This data provides valuable insights into mammalian tissue adaptations during spaceflight, and future research should continue these investigations with longer-duration missions to build a time-course of tendon adaptations to microgravity. This dataset includes results from atomic force microscopy using gastronemius tendon tissue.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "MHU-1:\nThree weeks prior to launch (L-21d), 100 mice (5 weeks old) were delivered from Jackson Lab to KSC. Then the 100 mice were acclimatized to the environment for three weeks in individual housing cages (Small Mouse Isolator 10027, Lab Products Inc., USA) in an air-conditioned room (temperature: 23 ± 3 °C; humidity: 40–65%) with a 12:12-h light–dark cycle at the SSPF Science Annex at KSC. Three acclimation phases were set: Phase I, body weight recovery phase (L-21d to L-14d); Phase II, water nozzle acclimation (L-14d to L-7d) and Phase III, flight food acclimation (L-7d to launch). After approximately three weeks of acclimation, the mice were ready for transport and reached the age of 8 weeks. Briefly, at Phase I, mice were fed CRF-1 and given water ad libitum using ball-type water nozzles. The drinking water was autoclaved tap water. The bedding material consisted of paper chips (ALPHA-DRI). At Phase II, water nozzles are changed to flight nozzles. Finally, at Phase III, the food was changed to flight food. Fecal collection and body swabs were obtained at L-13d, and these samples were sent to Charles River Laboratories in the USA for PCR-based SPF testing.\n\nDuring the acclimation phase, body weight and food/water consumption were measured and recorded. Four days prior to launch (L-4d), we divided 78 mice into six subgroups of 13 mice (12 mice for flight and one backup mouse for contingencies such as ear punching failure). The selection of flight candidate mice was based on body weight, food consumption and water intake. We also checked the health of each flight candidate mouse by evaluating the condition of their eyes, ears, teeth, fur and tail. The six subgroups were necessary to support possible launch attempts in case of unexpected postponements. A SONY HDR-GWP88 Handycam with 1440 × 1080 resolution (frame width × height) at a rate of 29 frames/s or a CASIO EX-ZR850 Digital Camera with 640 × 480 resolution (frame width × height) at a rate of 29 frames/s were used for shooting videos. All video images were processed by ffmpeg (https://ffmpeg.org/) and/or AviUtl (http://spring-fragrance.mints.ne.jp/aviutl/) and stored as mpeg files.\n\nMHU-4:\nNot Available\n\nMHU-5:\nNot Available     C57BL/6 J male mice (Stock  000664) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and Charles River Laboratories (Yokohama, Japan) for the MHU-1, – 4, and – 5 missions. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of JAXA (Protocol Number: 016-014B for MHU-1, No. 018-011D for MHU-4, and No. 018-036D for MHU-5), Explora Biolabs (Study Number: EB15-010A for MHU-1, No. EB19-003 for MHU-4, and No. SP19-003 for MHU-5), and NASA (Protocol Number: NAS-15-004-Y1 for MHU-1, No. FLT-18-118 for MHU-4, and No. JAXA MHU-5/FLT-19-121 for MHU-5). All experiments were conducted according to the guidelines and applicable laws in Japan and the USA.\n\nMHU-1: Twelve male C57BL/6 J mice (8 weeks old) in the TCU were launched aboard SpX-9 on June 18, 2016, from the NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida and were then transported to the ISS. The mice were divided into two groups: the MG group experienced microgravity, and the AG group was exposed to 1 g artificial gravity on the bottom floor of habitat cage units (HCUs) via centrifugation at 77 rpm in MARS-S (15 cm radius).\n\nMHU-4: Six male C57BL/6 J mice (9 weeks old) in the TCU were launched aboard SpX-17 on May 7, 2019, from the NASA KSC and were then transported to the ISS. The MHU-4_PG group was maintained in an artificial gravity environment at 1/6 g on the bottom floor of the HCU via centrifugation at 31 rpm in MARS-S (15 cm radius).\n\nMHU-5: Six C57BL/6 J male mice (9 weeks old) in the TCU were launched aboard SpX-20 on March 10, 2020, from the NASA KSC and were then transported to the ISS. The MHU-5_PG group was maintained in an artificial gravity environment at 1/6 g on the bottom floor of the HCU via centrifugation at 21 rpm in MARS-L (35 cm radius).\n\nThe GC group comprised six age-matched (8 or 9 weeks old) male C57BL/6 J mice per mission, maintained under the same conditions as those aboard the ISS. All mice from each mission were sacrificed on the second day after returning to Earth.  The left and right Sol and EDL muscles were neatly stacked on top of each other. The Achilles tendon side was vertically mounted on the tragacanth gum on a cork disc and quickly frozen in isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen. Thin frozen muscle sections (8 µm) were subjected to immunohistochemical and RNA-seq analyses.\n\nDuring the flight, temperature and humidity data loggers were attached to the TCU (launch and return phase) or inside the centrifuge-equipped biological experiment facility (CBEF-ALT) or CBEF-L (onboard phase) in all three missions. Following launch of the MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions, the logger data were processed. The MHU-1 mission data were previously published. The average temperatures at the onboard phases of MHU-4 and MHU-5 were 23.1C and 23.6C, respectively. Temperatures higher than 30  ̊C were observed in the return phase of MHU-5, especially in the sea transportation phase, and lasted 16 h. The average relative humidities at the onboard phases were 47.5% and 39.7% for MHU-4 and MHU- 5, respectively. The gas concentrations of carbon dioxide and ammonia were monitored by sensors attached inside the CBEF-ALT or CBEF-L. These concentrations were kept at a low level during the mission. The results indicate that mice were housed under a properly controlled environment. Since the radiation level in space is much higher than that on the ground, the total radiation dose during the approximately one-month flight was measured using the Bio Passive Dosimeter for Life Science Experiments in Space (Bio PADLES). The radiation absorbed dose rate was 0.31 ± 0.02 (MHU-4) and 0.36 ± 0.02 (MHU-5) mGy/day, and the dose equivalent rate was 0.48 ± 0.03 (MHU-4) and 0.79 ± 0.05 (MHU-5) mSv/day during the two space experiments. While high doses of radiation affect the health of mice, these values were comparable to those of the MHU-1 mission and appeared to be low- level, not causing the acute reactions in mice as those observed in astronauts.\n\nThe GC group comprised six age-matched (8 or 9 weeks old) male C57BL/6 J mice per mission, maintained under the same conditions as those aboard the ISS. All mice from each mission were sacrificed on the second day after returning to Earth.     All mice from each mission were sacrificed on the second day after returning to Earth. The left and right Sol and EDL muscles were neatly stacked on top of each other. The Achilles tendon side was vertically mounted on the tragacanth gum on a cork disc and quickly frozen in isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen. Thin frozen muscle sections (8 µm) were subjected to immunohistochemical and RNA-seq analyses.     Thin frozen muscle sections (8 µm) were subjected to immunohistochemical and RNA-seq analyses.     Using TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), total RNA was extracted from 100 sections of 8 μm frozen Sol muscle tissue, following standard protocols.     An RNA-seq library was prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) after ribosomal RNA (rRNA) depletion using the NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit (New England Biolabs).     Paired-end (2 × 36 bases) sequencing was performed using the NextSeq500 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.12.1 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.26. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of Mus-musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.2 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.2/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1).",

We recently developed a multiple artificial-gravity research system (MARS), which can generate gravity ranging from microgravity to Earth gravity (1 g) in space. Using the MARS, we studied the effects of three different gravitational levels (microgravity, lunar gravity [1/6 g], and 1 g) on the skeletal muscle mass and myofiber constitution in mice. All mice survived and returned to Earth, and skeletal muscle was collected two days after landing. We observed that microgravity-induced soleus muscle atrophy was prevented by lunar gravity. However, lunar gravity failed to prevent the slow-to-fast myofiber transition in the soleus muscle in space. These results suggest that lunar gravity is enough to maintain proteostasis, but a greater gravitational force is required to prevent the myofiber type transition. Our study proposes that different gravitational thresholds may be required for skeletal muscle adaptation.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "On August 14, 2017, SpaceX successfully launched the 12th Commercial Resupply Service (CRS-12) payload at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) which included 10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (n  equals 20) (Jackson laboratories, Inc. Bar harbor, ME) for NASA’s ninth Rodent Research experiment (RR-9). The mice lived in NASA’s Rodent Habitats (RH) aboard ISS for 35 days before returning to Earth via SpaceX’s Dragon capsule. All mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26–28 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle during the flight. GC mice were placed into the same housing hardware used in flight, and environmental parameters such as temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels were kept equivalent to that of FLT mice based on 48 h delayed telemetry data. GC mice were fed the same reformulated rodent food bar diet approved by NASA as the space flown mice. Consumption of food and water was monitored daily throughout this study.\n\nAnimal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Loma Linda University (LLU) and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and activities involving vertebrate animals are carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nDue to Hurricane Irma’s impact on KSC in September, 2017, experiments with both GC and GV control groups were cancelled and later rescheduled for May, 2018, using mice of the same strain, sex, age and animals were from the same holding room from the vendor that were used for the flight experiments. This resulted in a large time gap between tissue collection for the flight and KSC ground control groups. Consequently, the FV cohort-matched control group was added to the study to help control for possible differences associated with this delay. Tissue collection with the FV group were conducted several days after studies with the FLT animals were concluded.     Upon return to the Earth, mice were transported to LLU within 28 hours of splashdown. At LLU, animals were removed from the animal enclosure hardware and assessed for survival and health. The inspecting personnel reported that all the mice survived the 35-day space mission and were in good condition, i.e. no obvious deficiencies/abnormalities. Within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized.\n\nThe mice were rapidly euthanized in 100% CO2 and eyes were collected within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown (n  equals 20/group). The left eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. The right eyes from 2 experimental groups: GC and FLT were dissected to obtain the retina, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for proteomics analysis.\n\nA total of 12 frozen retinas from 2 experimental groups (GC and FLT, n  equals  6 mice per group) were shipped to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences for proteomics analysis.     Protein lysates were prepared and 20 μg of protein lysate were resolved in a 4–20% Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The gel was cut into 12 thick gel slices (2 mm thick) for each sample and an in-gel trypsin digestion was performed as previously described in (Mao et al. 2018). Briefly, gel slices were destained in 50% methanol (Thermo Fisher Scientific), ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 100 mM. Once destained, the proteins were reduced in 10 mM Tris [2-carboxyethyl] phosphine (Pierce, Dallas, TX) and alkylated in 50 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich). Gel slices were prepared for trypsin digestion by dehydrating in acetonitrile (Thermo Fisher Scientific). An overnight trypsin digestion was performed by the addition of 100 ng porcine sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubation at 37 °C for 12–16 hours. Peptide products were then acidified in 0.1% formic acid (Pierce Corp.) to stop the trypsin reaction.     Tryptic peptides were separated by reverse phase Jupiter Proteo resin (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) on a 200 × 0.075 mm column using a nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters). Peptides were eluted using a 30 minute gradient from 97:3 to 65:35 buffer A: B ratio. [Buffer A  equals  0.1% formic acid, 0.5% acetonitrile; buffer B  equals 0.1% formic acid, 99.9% acetonitrile.] The peptide eluents were ionized by electrospray (2.15 kV), MS1 peptides were detected and subjected to MS/MS analysis using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Corp.) in top-speed data-dependent mode. MS data were acquired using the FTMS analyzer in profile mode at a resolution of 240,000 over a range of 375 to 1500 m/z. MS/MS data were acquired using the ion trap analyzer in centroid mode and normal mass range with precursor mass-dependent normalized collision energy between 28.0 and 31.0.     Proteins were identified and quantified using MaxQuant (version 1.6.0.16, Max Planck Institute). MS/MS spectra were submitted to MaxQuant for database searching using the UniProtKB database (2018-06 release; restricted to Mus musculus; 81,557 entries). MS1 iBAQ protein intensities were obtained by performing a MS1 reporter type database search with trypsin digestion including up to three missed cleavages. Modifications included both fixed modifications (carbamidomethyl of cysteine) and variable modifications (oxidation on methionine and acetyl on N-terminus). The first search was set to 5 ppm precursor ion tolerance for a search against a contaminants database in order to identify commonly identified contaminants, such as keratin proteins. The main search against the mouse database was set to 3 ppm. Label-free quantitation with iBAQ with a minimum ratio of 1 was selected to obtain the MS1 intensity values. Peptide and protein identifications were accepted using the 1.0% false discovery rate identification threshold.\n\nThe MaxQuant iBAQ values for each sample were median normalized so the medians were equal to the sample with the maximum median (sample FLT 5). Median normalized iBAQ intensities were then imported into Perseus (version 1.6.1.3, Max Planck Institute). Perseus was used to log2 transform the data and impute the missing values using a normal distribution with a width of 0.3 and a downshift of 2 standard deviations. Principal Component Analysis was performed on the normalized data set and a batch effect was detected among replicates due to sample processing (data not shown). The batch effect was corrected using the R function ComBat from the SVA Bioconductor package. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney u tests were used to compare the ground GC and FLT sample groups. The p-values were corrected by Benjamini-Hochberg to account for multiple testing. Fold changes were also calculated. Proteins that were significant by the FDR-adjusted p-value  less than  0.05 and that had a fold change greater than 2 were considered to be differentially expressed.",

          "Study Description": "The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38 +/- 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and re-measured before the mice were euthanized after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4-19.3 mmHg vs 16.3-20.3 mmHg) (p  less than 0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups (p  less than  0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "From a previous publication using samples from the same payload: DOI: 10.1038/s42003-020-01227-2\n\nThe HCU rev.1 is an onboard habitation cage that accommodates one mouse per cage. The HCU is equipped with a food bar, watering system (two redundant water nozzles and a water balloon acting as power-free pressure source), an odor filter, two fans (for redundancy) for air ventilation, waste collecting equipment, an LED/IR video camera with a wiper inside the cage to keep the observation window clean. The health of each mouse was determined based on the conditions of eyes, ears, fur, and tail as observed in the transmitted videos. Paper sheets were mounted on the cage wall to quickly eliminate liquid, such as urine, from the cage. A photocatalytic thermal spray was applied to the sheets for deodorant and antibacterial effects. Air ventilation inside the cage was maintained by airflow (less than 0.2 m/s) generated by fans on the HCU. Differences in the volume of air ventilation and airflow rates between HCU in GC and microgravity conditions were negligible because the fans regulating ventilation in both gravity conditions were maintained at the same speed. The day/night cycle used 12-h intervals. Food and water were replenished once a week. Temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, and ammonia were monitored precisely and recorded in logs.\n\nThe TCU was used to transport mice aboard the SpaceX Dragon capsule during the launch and return phases, and was placed in a powered locker sized for ISS single cargo transfer bag. The TCU contains 12 cylindrical cages for housing mice individually. The TCU is equipped with a cylindrical food bar, watering system (a water nozzle and two water balloons), an odor filter, two fans (for redundancy), waste collecting equipment, and LEDs with lights for day/night cycle. Paper sheets mounted in the waste collection area were treated with photocatalytic thermal spray for deodorant and antibacterial effects, similar to the HCU. A temperature/humidity logger was attached on the TCU air inlet to monitor the environment during launch and reentry operations.\n\nAnimals\n\nNrf2-KO (Nfe212tm1Ymk) and WT male mice in the C57BL/6J background were bred at Charles River Laboratories Japan for MHU3. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of JAXA (protocol numbers 017-001 and 017-014), NASA (protocol number FLT-17-112), and Explora BioLabs (EB15-010C), and conducted according to the related guidelines and applicable laws of Japan and the United States of America.\n\nPre-launch acclimation activities and animal selection\n\nThree weeks prior to launch, 60 WT and 60 Nrf2-KO mice (8 weeks old) were delivered from Charles River Laboratories Japan to KSC. These mice were acclimatized to the environment in individual housing cages (Small Mouse Isolator 10027, Lab Products) in an air-conditioned room (temperature: 23 ± 3 °C; humidity: 40–65%) with a 12:12-h light/dark cycle at the SSPF Science Annex at KSC. Three acclimation phases were set: Phase I, body weight recovery phase; Phase II, water nozzle acclimation phase and Phase III, flight food acclimation phase. After approximately three weeks of acclimation, the mice were ready for transport to the ISS and had reached the age of 12 weeks. Succinctly, at Phase I, mice were fed CRF-1 and given autoclaved tap water ad libitum using ball-type water nozzles. The bedding material consisted of paper chips (ALPHA-DRI). At Phase II, water nozzles are changed to flight nozzles. Finally, at Phase III, the food was changed to flight food. Fecal collection and body swabs were obtained, and these samples were sent to Charles River Laboratories in USA for pol-based SPF testing.\n\nAs some of the Nrf2-KO mice harbor an intrahepatic shunt35, Nrf2-KO mice were challenged with 100 mg/kg ketamine and 5 mg/kg xylazine and recovery times were monitored at the age of 9 weeks to eliminate the mice harboring an intrahepatic shunt. Nrf2-KO mice with long sleeping duration were judged as mice without shunts. Blood was taken from tails of all 120 mice.\n\nDuring the acclimation phase, body weight and food/water consumption were measured and recorded. We selected 12 mice for flight and backup, respectively. The selection of flight candidate mice was based on body weight, food consumption, water intake, and absence of hepatic shunt. We also checked the health of each flight candidate mouse by evaluating the condition of their eyes, ears, teeth, fur, and tail. The five subgroups of flight candidates were necessary to support possible launch attempts in case of unexpected postponements.\n\n\nOnboard operations by ISS crew\n\nOne day prior to launch, 12 mice were loaded into the TCU and made ready for launch. Mice were transported to the ISS by SpX14. After the Dragon vehicle of SpX14 berthed with the ISS, mice were transferred to the HCU by a crew member. Mouse-husbandry tasks included exchanging food cartridges, supplying water, collecting waste, and replacing odor filters. The block food (approximately 35 g) is contained in the cartridge, which supports 1-week habitation. The cartridges have windows and scale at their sides, therefore the remaining amount of the foods was estimated, via video without returning them to the ground, at weekly food cartridge exchange operations. After 31 days onboard the ISS, mice were transferred to the TCU for the return to Earth.\n\nReturn phase and animal dissection\n\nAfter unberthing from the ISS, the Dragon vehicle splashed down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California. After a ship picked up the cargo, the returned TCU was transported to a port in Long Beach. JAXA received the TCU from NASA and transported them to Explora BioLabs in San Diego using an environmentally controlled van. After the health and body weights of mice were assessed, open field, light/dark transition and Y-maze tests were performed. Blood was collected from tail after the behavioral tests. Isoflurane-anesthetized mice were then euthanized by exsanguination and dissected for the collection of tissue samples.\n\nGC experiment\n\nA GC experiment that simulated the space experiment was conducted at JAXA Tsukuba in Japan from September 17 to October 20, 2018. Six WT and six Nrf2-KO mice without the hepatic shunts were individually housed in the same way as for the flight experiment. Both the TCU and HCU were placed in an air-conditioned room (average temperature: 22.9 °C; average humidity: 48.4%) with a 12:12-h light/dark cycle. Fan-generated airflow (0.2 m/s) inside the HCU maintained the same conditions as in the flight experiment. The mice were fed CRF-1. The bedding material consisted of paper chips (ALPHA-DRI) in the acclimation cages, but was not used in the HCU. Feeder cartridges and water bottles were replaced once a week, and cages in the HCU were not replenished. After the health and body weights of mice were assessed, open field, light/dark transition and Y-maze tests were performed. Blood sampling from the tail was conducted as for the flight experiment. All mice were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation and euthanized under anesthesia, and then dissected to collect tissue samples.     Return phase and animal dissection\n\nAfter unberthing from the ISS, the Dragon vehicle splashed down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California. After a ship picked up the cargo, the returned TCU was transported to a port in Long Beach. JAXA received the TCU from NASA and transported them to Explora BioLabs in San Diego using an environmentally controlled van. After the health and body weights of mice were assessed, open field, light/dark transition and Y-maze tests were performed. Blood was collected from tail after the behavioral tests. Isoflurane-anesthetized mice were then euthanized by exsanguination and dissected for the collection of tissue samples.     Total RNA was isolated from the cryopreserved bone marrow cells in CELLBANKER2 liquid by directly adding 3 mL ISOGEN-LS (NIPPON GENE) at room temperature. RNA integrity was assessed using an Agilent 2200 TapeStation.     Two hundred nanograms of total RNA was subjected to cDNA library preparation using the MGIEasy RNA Directional Library Prep Set (MGI).     The libraries were sequenced using DNBSEQ-G400 (MGI).     The raw reads were mapped to the mouse mm10 genome using STAR (version 2.6.1). Transcripts per million (TPM) values were obtained to measure gene expression using RSEM (version 1.3.1). TPM values of spleen samples were obtained from a previously published dataset18. The TPM was normalised in iDEP.9539. Genes with a TPM above one in at least one sample were included in further analyses. k-means clustering was performed by iDEP.95. DEGs were analysed with a false discovery rate cut-off less than 0.1 and a fold change cut-off greater than or equal to 2 using iDEP.95. Global analysis heatmaps were produced using R-based heatmap.3 and gplots packages.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of Mus-musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.4/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Description": "Spaceflight-related stresses impact health via various body systems, including the haematopoietic and immune systems, with effects ranging from moderate alterations of homoeostasis to serious illness. Oxidative stress appears to be involved in these changes, and the transcription factor Nrf2, which regulates expression of a set of cytoprotective and antioxidative stress response genes, has been implicated in the response to spaceflight-induced stresses. Here, we show through analyses of mice from the MHU-3 project, in which Nrf2-knockout mice travelled in space for 31 days, that mice lacking Nrf2 suffer more seriously from spaceflight-induced immunosuppression than wild-type mice. We discovered that a one-month spaceflight-triggered the expression of tissue inflammatory marker genes in wild-type mice, an effect that was even more pronounced in the absence of Nrf2. Concomitant with induction of inflammatory conditions, the consumption of coagulation-fibrinolytic factors and platelets was elevated by spaceflight and further accelerated by Nrf2 deficiency. These results highlight that Nrf2 mitigates spaceflight-induced inflammation, subsequent immunosuppression, and thrombotic microangiopathy. These observations reveal a new strategy to relieve health problems encountered during spaceflight.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "All mouse experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Tsukuba, JAXA, Explore Biolabs, and NASA, and were conducted in accordance with the applicable guidelines in Japan and the United States of America. All animal procedures conformed to the ARRIVE guidelines for reporting animal research. The mouse liver samples were unanalyzed samples from the mouse breeding experiments performed by JAXA on the International Space Station (ISS) Kibo in 2017 as described in https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-019-0077-0. Briefly, pre-launch acclimation was conducted in the Space Station Processing Facility Science Annex at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) (FL, USA). Five-week-old C57BL/6J male mice (stock number 000664) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) for space and ground control experiments. Twelve flight mice were given a health check by the NASA Launch Facility veterinarian before installation into the transportation cage unit (TCU). The selected mice were installed into the TCU and launched to the ISS via Space-X12 on August 14, 2017 (GMT). The Space-X12 arrived at the ISS on August 17, 2017 (GMT), and mice were relocated from the TCU to the habitat cage units (HCU) by an astronaut. We divided the mice into two groups of six mice each [AG (≈ 1 g, at a centrifugation speed of 77 rpm) and MG], and they were caged in the ISS for approximately 30 days. This time span was determined based on the flight schedule of this mission (mission : MHU-2). The mice were relocated from the HCU to the TCU for return to Earth on September 16, 2017 (GMT), and the Dragon vehicle loading the TCU splashed down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California on September 17, 2017 (GMT). The environmental conditions of housing were as close as possible to acclimation conditions at KSC, and mouse diets and water consumption were the same as those used during the flight as previously described; for example, the temperature was controlled at 23 ± 3 °C in flight and 23.0 °C on the ground, the humidity was controlled at 40 ± 15% in flight and 47.3% on the ground, and the CO2 concentration was 0.29% for A1G mice onboard, 0.33% for MG mice onboard, and 0.04% on the ground. All the mice were sacrificed and dissected within 36.5 h of splashdown. Isoflurane-anesthetized mice were euthanized by exsanguination.     The organs were removed and snap-frozen in liquid N2, kept in a − 80 °C freezer. A ground control experiment was conducted from January 18 to March 22, 2018, at JAXA (Tsukuba, Japan).     A piece of liver weighing 20–30 mg was cut from each liver sample on dry ice. Homogenization was performed using a disposable homogenizer (Biomasher II, AS ONE CORPORATION, Osaka, Japan) on ice. RNA was isolated and purified using NucleoSpin RNA (Takara, Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was eluted in 40 μl RNase-free water per sample. The concentration and absorbance ratios of all RNA samples were measured using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).     The Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) for poly(A) RNA preparation and NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) were used for library preparation.     The messenger RNA (mRNA) obtained from the livers of mice was sequenced using NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA).     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of Mus-musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.4/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Description": "Spaceflight induces hepatic damage, partially owing to oxidative stress caused by the space environment such as microgravity and space radiation. We examined the roles of anti-oxidative sulfur-containing compounds on hepatic damage after spaceflight. We analyzed the livers of mice on board the International Space Station for 30 days. During spaceflight, half of the mice were exposed to artificial earth gravity (1 g) using centrifugation cages. Sulfur-metabolomics of the livers of mice after spaceflight revealed a decrease in sulfur antioxidants (ergothioneine, glutathione, cysteine, taurine, thiamine, etc.) and their intermediates (cysteine sulfonic acid, hercynine, N-acethylserine, serine, etc.) compared to the controls on the ground. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing showed upregulation of gene sets related to oxidative stress and sulfur metabolism, and downregulation of gene sets related to glutathione reducibility in the livers of mice after spaceflight, compared to controls on the ground. These changes were partially mitigated by exposure to 1 g centrifugation. For the first time, we observed a decrease in sulfur antioxidants based on a comprehensive analysis of the livers of mice after spaceflight. Our data suggest that a decrease in sulfur-containing compounds owing to both microgravity and other spaceflight environments (radiation and stressors) contributes to liver damage after spaceflight.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Ten-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were launched at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and spent 35 days aboard the International Space Station (ISS). All mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26–28 degrees Celsius with a 12-h light/dark cycle during the flight. All mice were provided NASA Nutrient-upgraded Rodent Food Bar (NuRFB) and autoclaved deionized water ad libitum. MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (BuOE) at 1 mg/kg (0.2 mL) was administrated subcutaneously 7 days prior to the flight launch and weekly aboard the ISS. All mice were subdivided into saline or BuOE-treated groups. Upon return to the Earth, spaceflight mice were transported to the research laboratory at Roskamp Institute, Sarasota, Florida, within 20 h of splashdown. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth for 35 days in flight hardware cages under similar environmental conditions as the flight groups, including the same food, light/dark, temperature, treatment (SAL or BuOE), and euthanasia regimens. The protocol for GC mice commenced three days subsequent to the commencement of the protocol for spaceflight mice. Mice were exsanguinated by closed-cardiac blood collection under deep Ketamine/Xylazine (150/45 mg/kg) anesthesia, followed by cervical dislocation as a secondary euthanasia method to ensure death.     After sacrifice, mouse brains were then removed and prepared as follows. The left hemibrains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 24 h and then rinsed and washed with PBS for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays or spatial genomics profiling. The right brains were flash-frozen and stored at -80 degrees Celsius for further analysis. The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Loma Linda University (LLU), Roskamp Institute, and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).     Three 6 μm formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections selected at a similar focal plane from three mice in each group were mounted on one slide for a total of 4 slides, one for each group (GC-SAL, GC-BuOE, FLT-SAL, and FLT-BuOE).     Slides were baked for 2 h at 65 °C for paraffin removal before loading onto a Leica BOND RX for tissue rehydration in EtOH and ddH2O, heat-induced epitope retrieval (ER2 for 20 min at 100 °C) and proteinase K treatment (1.0 μg/mL for 15 min at 37 °C). Tissue sections were then hybridized with the Mouse Whole Transcriptome Atlas (WTA) probes overnight at 37 °C. Following 2 × 5 min stringent washes (1:1 4× SSC buffer and formamide), the slides were blocked for 30 min and then incubated with morphology marker antibodies for 1 h to guide region of interest (ROI) selection: GFAP (Texas Red/615nm channel, Alexa 594 fluorophore, 1:200 dilution, and Iba1 (Cy5/666nm channel, Alexa 647 fluorophore, 1:100 dilution. Syto83 (Cy3/568 nm channel, Alexa 532 fluorophore, 1:10 dilution was used as a nuclear stain. After ROI selection, UV light was directed by the GeoMx (https://nanostring.com/products/geomx-digital-spatial-profiler/, accessed on 3 February 2022, NanoString Technologies, Inc., Seattle, WA, USA) device at each area of illumination (AOI), releasing the RNA-ID containing oligonucleotide tags from the WTA probes for collection into a unique well for each AOI.     For library preparation, Illumina i5 and i7 dual indexing primers were added to the oligonucleotide tags during PCR to uniquely index each AOI. AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were used for PCR purification.

While little is known about how spaceflight affects transcription spatially in the brain, a greater understanding of this process has the potential to aid strategies that mitigate the effects of spaceflight on the brain. Therefore, we performed GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling of mouse brains subjected to either spaceflight or grounded controls. Four brain regions were selected: Cortex, Frontal Cortex, Corunu Ammonis I, and Dentate Gyrus. Antioxidants have emerged as a potential means of attenuating the effects of spaceflight, so we treated a subset of the mice with a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE). Our analysis revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes due to spaceflight in each of the four brain regions. Both common and region-specific transcriptomic responses were observed. Metabolic pathways and pathways sensitive to oxidative stress were enriched in the four brain regions due to spaceflight. These findings enhance our understanding of brain regional variation in susceptibility to spaceflight conditions. BuOE reduced the transcriptomic effects of spaceflight at a large number of genes, suggesting that this compound may attenuate oxidative stress-induced brain damage caused by the spaceflight environment. This study contains data of dentate gyrus region. The data of other brain regions are deposited in OSD-682 (cornu ammonis 1), OSD-698 (frontal cortex), and OSD-699 (cerebral cortex).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Three 6 μm formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections selected at a similar focal plane from three mice in each group were mounted on one slide for a total of 4 slides, one for each group (GC-SAL, GC-BuOE, FLT-SAL, and FLT-BuOE).     Slides were baked for 2 h at 65 °C for paraffin removal before loading onto a Leica BOND RX for tissue rehydration in EtOH and ddH2O, heat-induced epitope retrieval (ER2 for 20 min at 100 °C) and proteinase K treatment (1.0 μg/mL for 15 min at 37 °C). Tissue sections were then hybridized with the Mouse Whole Transcriptome Atlas (WTA) probes overnight at 37 °C. Following 2 × 5 min stringent washes (1:1 4× SSC buffer and formamide), the slides were blocked for 30 min and then incubated with morphology marker antibodies for 1 h to guide region of interest (ROI) selection: GFAP (Texas Red/615nm channel, Alexa 594 fluorophore, 1:200 dilution, and Iba1 (Cy5/666nm channel, Alexa 647 fluorophore, 1:100 dilution. Syto83 (Cy3/568 nm channel, Alexa 532 fluorophore, 1:10 dilution was used as a nuclear stain. After ROI selection, UV light was directed by the GeoMx (https://nanostring.com/products/geomx-digital-spatial-profiler/, accessed on 3 February 2022, NanoString Technologies, Inc., Seattle, WA, USA) device at each area of illumination (AOI), releasing the RNA-ID containing oligonucleotide tags from the WTA probes for collection into a unique well for each AOI.     For library preparation, Illumina i5 and i7 dual indexing primers were added to the oligonucleotide tags during PCR to uniquely index each AOI. AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were used for PCR purification. Library concentration was measured using a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific,Waltham, MA, USA), and quality was assessed using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA).     Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of Mus-musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.     Ten-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were launched at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and spent 35 days aboard the International Space Station (ISS). All mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26–28 degrees Celsius with a 12-h light/dark cycle during the flight. All mice were provided NASA Nutrient-upgraded Rodent Food Bar (NuRFB) and autoclaved deionized water ad libitum. MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (BuOE) at 1 mg/kg (0.2 mL) was administrated subcutaneously 7 days prior to the flight launch and weekly aboard the ISS. All mice were subdivided into saline or BuOE-treated groups. Upon return to the Earth, spaceflight mice were transported to the research laboratory at Roskamp Institute, Sarasota, Florida, within 20 h of splashdown. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth for 35 days in flight hardware cages under similar environmental conditions as the flight groups, including the same food, light/dark, temperature, treatment (SAL or BuOE), and euthanasia regimens. The protocol for GC mice commenced three days subsequent to the commencement of the protocol for spaceflight mice. Mice were exsanguinated by closed-cardiac blood collection under deep Ketamine/Xylazine (150/45 mg/kg) anesthesia, followed by cervical dislocation as a secondary euthanasia method to ensure death.     After sacrifice, mouse brains were then removed and prepared as follows. The left hemibrains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 24 h and then rinsed and washed with PBS for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays or spatial genomics profiling. The right brains were flash-frozen and stored at -80 degrees Celsius for further analysis. The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Loma Linda University (LLU), Roskamp Institute, and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).",

While little is known about how spaceflight affects transcription spatially in the brain, a greater understanding of this process has the potential to aid strategies that mitigate the effects of spaceflight on the brain. Therefore, we performed GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling of mouse brains subjected to either spaceflight or grounded controls. Four brain regions were selected: Cortex, Frontal Cortex, Corunu Ammonis I, and Dentate Gyrus. Antioxidants have emerged as a potential means of attenuating the effects of spaceflight, so we treated a subset of the mice with a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE). Our analysis revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes due to spaceflight in each of the four brain regions. Both common and region-specific transcriptomic responses were observed. Metabolic pathways and pathways sensitive to oxidative stress were enriched in the four brain regions due to spaceflight. These findings enhance our understanding of brain regional variation in susceptibility to spaceflight conditions. BuOE reduced the transcriptomic effects of spaceflight at a large number of genes, suggesting that this compound may attenuate oxidative stress-induced brain damage caused by the spaceflight environment. This study contains data of cerebral cortex region. The data of other brain regions are deposited in OSD-682 (cornu ammonis 1), OSD-685 (dentate gyrus), and OSD-698 (frontal cortex).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "The extraction of RNA from cardiac tissue was conducted using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. A total of 25 mg of cardiac tissue was homogenized with QIAzol (Qiagen) and centrifuged. The aqueous layer was extracted, and then filtered using RNeasy Mini Spin columns provided in the kit. RNA was eluted using 30 uL of RNase-free water. RNA quality was assessed using nanodrop and gel electrophoresis, and RIN greater than 8 was verified prior to sequencing.     Poly(A) RNA sequencing was performed by LC Sciences (Houston, Texas) using RNA from three ground control mice and three spaceflight mice. The Poly(A) sequencing library was prepared using Illumina’s TrueSeq-stranded-mRNA sample preparation protocol. An Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer was utilized to validate RNA integrity. An Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Chip was used to conduct quality control analyses and quantification of the sequencing library.     Paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina’s NovaSeq 6000 system.     To conduct transcript assembly, Cutadapt and perl scripts in house were used to remove reads with adaptor contamination, low-quality bases, and undetermined bases. Sequence quality was verified using FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) version 0.10.1 (accessed on 01 September 2022). HISAT2 was utilized to map the genome of ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-101/fasta/mus_musculus/dna/ v101 (accessed on 01 September 2022), while StringTie was used for transcript assembly. The comprehensive transcriptome was generated from merged transcriptomes via perl scripts and gffcompare (https://github.com/gpertea/gffcompare/) (accessed on 01 September 2022). To conduct mRNA expression profiling, LC Sciences utilized StringTie and Ballgown (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ballgown.html) (accessed on 01 September 2022). StringTie specifically was used to calculate FPKM. R package DESeq and edgeR were used to determine differentially expressed mRNAs. A p-value of 0.05 and a fold change cutoff of 2 were chosen for this analysis. This subsequent data was analyzed u\\sing Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Qiagen, https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuitypathway-analysis), (accessed 27 October 2022). RNA sequencing data was additionally uploaded to STRING and David Gene Ontology to determine significantly affected pathways and functions.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of Mus-musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.4/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).     Female C57BL/6J mice aged 8–9 weeks old were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were shipped to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Space Life Sciences Laboratory (SLSL). Although there were several groups in this study, this report focuses on the transcriptomic changes in the heart when mice are housed in the spaceflight environment for 30 days. Mice were acclimatized for 1–2 weeks prior to the initiation of the study. Their living conditions were controlled for temperature and humidity and included a 12:12 h light–dark cycle. Food and water were provided ad libitum. During this adaptation period, the mice were adapted to the flight hardware (Rodent Research Hardware System). Mice flown on the International Space Station (ISS) and comparable ground control mice were maintained under identical conditions, including a single injection of saline. At 30 days, flight mice were transferred into the ISS Microgravity Sciences Glovebox (MSG), were euthanized via intraperitoneal (IP) injection of Ketamine/Xylazine (150/45 mg/kg) anesthesia followed by closed-cardiac puncture exsanguination and cervical dislocation. After removal of the spleen, mice were wrapped in foil, frozen and stored in the Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) at −96 °C until sample return. NASA GLACIER and Cold Bag lockers were used to transport samples back to the ground following mission completion.     The frozen ground control and spaceflight mice were slightly thawed, dissected on ice, and the inferior two-thirds of the hearts were extracted. Cardiac tissue sections were stored in RNALater, RNAProtect, or were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNAProtect samples were stored at −20C. The RNALater and flash-frozen samples were stored at −80C. RNA was isolated from the hearts of three mice flown on the ISS and three hearts from comparable hardware- and age-matched ground control mice.",

Multiple organ systems are affected by microgravity and radiation, including the cardiovascular system. Previous transcriptomic studies have sought to reveal the changes in gene expression after spaceflight. However, little is known about the impact of long-term spaceflight on the mouse heart in vivo. This study focuses on the transcriptomic changes in the hearts of female C57BL/6J mice flown on the International Space Station (ISS) for 30 days. RNA was isolated from the hearts of three flight and three comparable ground control mice and RNA sequencing was performed. Our analyses showed that 1147 transcripts were significantly regulated after spaceflight. The MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and GPCR signaling pathways were predicted to be activated. Transcripts related to cytoskeleton breakdown and organization were upregulated, but no significant change in the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) components or oxidative stress pathway-associated transcripts occurred. Our results indicate an absence of cellular senescence, and a significant upregulation of transcripts associated with the cell cycle. Transcripts related to cellular maintenance and survival were most affected by spaceflight, suggesting that cardiovascular transcriptome initiates an adaptive response to long-term spaceflight.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Soleus samples were obtained from the RR18 mission through the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection. We were provided with 3 experimental groups: 1) Flight (F) group housed in specialized mission hardware; 2) Ground control (GC) housed in specialized mission hardware here on Earth; and 3) Vivarium (VIV) control housed in standard laboratory cages and conditions. For the RR18 mission, male C57BL/6J (10 weeks of age at time of launch) mice were acclimated and then launched in a specialized transporter and transferred to Rodent Habitats on board the International Space Station (ISS) for 32 days. Additional details on housing and tissue collection/preparation can be found elsewhere. All mice were treated weekly with either BuOE or saline via subcutaneous injection beginning one week prior to launch.     Upon live return, animals were euthanized via cardiac puncture, ketamine/xylazine injection, and soleus muscles were dissected and fixed in RNAlater at 4C overnight, then stored at -80C. Sample names for the ATPase assay are formatted as [SourceAnimal]_[Plate]_[Well]_[AmountCaCl2]_[Replicate]. The plate and well locations will allow for the tracing of the data to its value in the raw data, and the amount of 10 mM CaCl2 is an experimental factor important for the ATPase assay.     A bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay was used to determine sample protein concentration using an M2 Molecular Devices Plate Reader (Molecular Devices). All Western blots used BioRad TGX 4–15% gradient gels (SERCA1a, SERCA2a, RYR, p-RYR, 4-HNE, SOD) or lab-made tricine (SLN, NNAT, PLN) with PVDF membranes or Nitrocellulose (for SLN). Samples were then prepped and equally loaded for gel electrophoresis on BioRad PowerPac.     Transfer was conducted via BioRad Transblot Turbo (SERCA1a, SERCA2a, RYR, p-RYR, 4-HNE, SOD) or using wet transfer (SLN, NNAT, PLN).     Following transfer, membranes were blocked in BioRad Every Blot blocking buffer (12010020) for 10 min at room temperature followed by a 3x5min wash with TBST.     Antibodies for SERCA1a, SERCA2a, RYR, p-RYR, 4-HNE, SOD, SLN, NNAT, and PLN were used for labeling.     Primary antibodies for SERCA1a (ThermoFisher Scientific MA3-912), SERCA2a (ThermoFisher Scientific MA3-919), RYR (ThermoFisher Scientific MA3-925), p-RYR (Affinity Biotech, AF3703), 4-HNE (Millipore Sigma, AB5605), SOD (Novus, NB100-1992SS), SLN (Sigma Aldrich, ABT13), NNAT (Cell Signaling Technology, 78122S), and PLN (ThermoFisher Scientific, MA3-922) were incubated overnight at 4C and washed 3x5min with TBST.     Secondary antibodies for SERCA1a, SERCA2a, RYR, PLN (Cell signaling, 7076S), p-RYR, SOD, SLN, NNAT (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 711-035-152), and 4-HNE (Novex, A15999) were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature and washed 3x5min with TBST.     Millipore Immobilon chemiluminescent substrate was added and then visualized using a BioRad ChemiDoc MP for protein detection.     Ponceau staining was used for protein normalization.     Precision Plus Protein  All Blue Prestained Protein Standards (BioRad  1610373) ladder was used for imaging.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with an assay data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.     SERCA ATPase activity was assessed using an enzyme-linked spectrophotometric assay as previously described. Muscles were thawed, rinsed from RNALater. 8 mg of muscle was homogenized in 80 uL of homogenizing buffer.     5 mL of ATPase buffer containing 20 uL of homogenate, 12 uL lactase dehydrogenate, and 18 uL pyruvate kinase was added to tubes containing 4, 6, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 30, 31, or 31.5 uL of 10 mM CaCl2. To all but one 31.5 uL tube, 10.5 uL of Ca2 ionophore was added to induce pores in the SR/ER membrane in order to prevent intraluminal Ca2 accumulation. To the other 31.5 uL tube, 1 uL cyclopiazonic acid was added to acquire a measurement of basal (or Ca2-independent) ATPase activity. Each tube was added to a 96-well plate in duplicate.     The Ca2+ - dependent ATPase assay is measured in duplicate at 37 °C using a Thermo Scientific Multiskan FC Microplate Photometer at 340 nm for 30 minutes.",

          "Study Description": "Spending time in a microgravity environment is known to cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness via muscle unloading, which can be partly attributed to Ca2+ dysregulation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump is responsible for bringing Ca2+ from the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), at the expense of ATP. We have recently demonstrated that, in the soleus of spaceflown mice, the Ca2+ uptake ability of the SERCA pump is severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), to which SERCA is highly susceptible. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with the antioxidant, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP (BuOE), could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction. We received soleus muscles from the rodent research 18 mission which had male mice housed on the international space station for 35 days and treated with either saline or BuOE. Spaceflight significantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and significantly increased SERCA’s ionophore ratio, a measure of SR Ca2+ leak, and 4-HNE content (marker of RONS), none of which could be rescued by BuOE treatment. In conclusion, we find that spaceflight induces significant soleus muscle atrophy and SR Ca2+ leak that cannot be counteracted with antioxidant treatment. Future work should investigate alternative therapeutics that are specifically aimed at increasing SERCA activation or reducing Ca2+ leak. This study derives results from the Western Blot and ATPase Assays using soleus tissue from the RR-18 mission.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Bion-M1 mice (4-5 months of age) were flown in an unmanned, 30-day-long orbital spaceflight inside the Block Obespecheniya Soderzhaniya (BOS) rodent housing. Housing and climate parameters were replicated in the subsequent ground control (GC) experiment (July 26 to August 26, 2013). A total of 4 experimental groups were used for the flight and ground control experiments (n  equals 45 per group). An additional fifth group included the backup mice for the main flight group (n  equals 45). Mice of the space flight group (SF) were exposed to microgravity for 30 days. Concurrent with the SF mice, another group of 45 mice remained in the animal facility (SFV). The ground control (GC) experiment was conducted, after the landing, in the refurbished BOS flight habitats. The habitats were installed in a climatic chamber that replicated the temperature, humidity, gas composition and other flight-specific climate parameters. The corresponding vivarium control (GCV) mice were housed in the animal facility. The separate and concurrent GCV groups were used to account for possible seasonal differences between SF and GC mice. Individually ventilated cages (GM 500, Techniplast, floor area 500 cm2) were used. Techniplast mice shelters (red plastic triangles, 15Lx11Wx8H cm), paper tubes and paper tissues for nesting material were provided to enrich the environment. Cage cleaning was done once weekly, and water was refreshed twice weekly. All materials were sterilized prior to use by autoclave. Techniques aimed to prevent animal contamination were thoroughly followed. The living compartment of each habitat was an acrylic cylinder 98±2 mm in diameter and 200±10 mm in length with a total volume of approximately 1.7 l. A stainless steel feeder (9 ml) was mounted at one end (the “top”) of the cylinder. The feeder had a flap, used in the refill procedure. The food distribution system (except for the feeders) was common to all five habitats in the block. Paste “space” food was pumped from the container and distributed between individual habitats of the assembly 6 times daily (every 4 hours at 00:00, 04:00, 08:00, 12:00, 16:00 and 20:00), a total of 54 g/day per 3 mice. Food distribution was adjusted through manipulations of pressure developed in the container and in the feeders to follow this pattern prior to experiments. Bulbs for day-phase (08:00–20:00, 45±5 Lux) and night-phase (20:00–08:00, 5±2 Lux) lighting, an air supply fan (0.3 m/s) and an air distribution system were positioned on one side of the cylinder. A video camera was installed between the light bulbs; video was recorded 6 times daily (simultaneously with feeding, each session lasted 2 hours) at 8 frames per second. The opposite side of the cylinder had the grid for waste removal. The waste removal system was individual for each habitat. The door at the “bottom” of the cylinder had a glass window. In order to minimize impact of variability arising from possible differences in mice housing conditions, experimental subgroups were formed from mice that were housed in different habitats. Air composition and climate parameters in the satellite were maintained by the centralized life support system and remained in the designed range throughout the flight.     After landing mice were examined and transported to Moscow, where animals of the in vitro subgroup were dissected, while recovery dynamics was followed in the in-vivo subgroup before dissection 7 days after landing. Samples were stored at -80C.     A bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay was used to determine sample protein concentration using an M2 Molecular Devices Plate Reader (Molecular Devices). All Western blots used BioRad TGX 4–15% gradient gels (4561086: BioRad) and PVDF membranes. Samples were then prepped and equally loaded for gel electrophoresis.     Transfer was conducted via BioRad Transblot Turbo.     Following transfer, membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBST for 60 min or BioRad Every Blot blocking buffer (12010020) for 10 min.     Antibodies from pGSK3b (9336), total (t)-GSK3-b (9315), pGSK3a (9316), tGSK3a (4818), b-Catenin (8480) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). Following blocking, the appropriate primary antibody was appropriately diluted and added during an overnight incubation at 4C. After incubation with appropriate primary antibodies membranes were washed 3 times for 5 min with TBST then incubated for 60 min with the analogous secondary anti-rabbit (7074; Cell Signaling Technology; p-GSK3a, GSK3a p-GSK3b, GSK3b, b-catenin) antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Upon secondary incubation, membranes were washed another 3 times with TBST for 5-min each.     Millipore Immobilon (WBKLSO500) chemiluminescent substrate was added and then visualized using a BioRad ChemiDoc MP for protein detection.     Ponceau staining was used for protein normalization (59803; Cell Signaling Technology).

          "Study Description": "We examined the effects of ~30 days of spaceflight on glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) content and inhibitory serine phosphorylation in murine muscle and bone samples from four separate missions (BION-M1, Rodent Research missions RR1, RR9, and RR18). Spaceflight reduced GSK3b content across all missions, whereas its serine phosphorylation was elevated with RR18 and BION-M1. The reduction in GSK3b was linked to the reduction in type IIA fibers commonly observed with spaceflight as these fibers are particularly enriched with GSK3. We then tested the effects of inhibiting GSK3 before this fiber type shift, and we demonstrate that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased muscle mass, preserved muscle strength, and promoted the oxidative fiber type with Earth-based hindlimb unloading. In bone, GSK3 activation was enhanced after spaceflight; and strikingly, muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion increased bone mineral density in response to hindlimb unloading. Thus, future studies should test the effects of GSK3 inhibition during spaceflight. This study derives results from the Western Blot assay using EDL tissue from the Bion-M1 mission. The Extensor Digitorum Longus data in this study are related to other studies using data from the same experiment; OSD-654 (Tibia), OSD-660 (Tibialis Anterior), OSD-661 (Lumbar Spine), OSD-662 (Soleus), and OSD-663 (Femur).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "A bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay was used to determine sample protein concentration using an M2 Molecular Devices Plate Reader (Molecular Devices). All Western blots used BioRad TGX 4–15% gradient gels (4561086: BioRad) and PVDF membranes. Samples were then prepped and equally loaded for gel electrophoresis.     Transfer was conducted via BioRad Transblot Turbo.     Following transfer, membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBST for 60 min or BioRad Every Blot blocking buffer (12010020) for 10 min.     Antibodies from pGSK3b (9336), total (t)-GSK3-b (9315), pGSK3a (9316), tGSK3a (4818), b-Catenin (8480) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). MHC I (BA-F8), IIa (SC-71), IIx (6H1), and IIb (BF-F3) antibodies as well as the antibodies for Pax7 (AB_528428) and myogenin (F5D) were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa). The antibodies for FNDC5 and COXIV were obtained from Abcam (ab13190 and abS16056, respectively) and the antibody for PGC-1a was obtained from Millipore (ST1204). Following blocking, the appropriate primary antibody was appropriately diluted and added during an overnight incubation at 4C. After incubation with appropriate primary antibodies membranes were washed 3 times for 5 min with TBST then incubated for 60 min with the analogous secondary anti-mouse (7076; Cell Signaling Technology; MHC I, IIa, IIx, IIb) or anti-rabbit (7074; Cell Signaling Technology; p-GSK3a, GSK3a p-GSK3b, GSK3b, b-catenin) antibody both conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Upon secondary incubation, membranes were washed another 3 times with TBST for 5-min each.     Millipore Immobilon (WBKLSO500) chemiluminescent substrate was added and then visualized using a BioRad ChemiDoc MP for protein detection.     Ponceau staining was used for protein normalization (59803; Cell Signaling Technology).     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.     Soleus samples were obtained from the RR1, RR9, and RR18 missions through the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection. We were provided with 3 experimental groups: 1) Flight (F) group housed in specialized mission hardware; 2) Ground control (GC) housed in specialized mission hardware here on Earth; and 3) Vivarium (VIV) control housed in standard laboratory cages and conditions. For the RR9 and RR18 missions, male C57BL/6J (10 weeks of age at time of launch) mice were acclimated and then launched in a specialized transporter and transferred to Rodent Habitats on board the International Space Station (ISS). For the RR1 mission, female C57BL/6J (21-22 weeks of age at time of launch) mice were acclimated and then launched in a specialized transporter and transferred to Rodent Habitats on board the International Space Station (ISS). Bion-M1 mice (4-5 months of age) were flown in an unmanned, 30-day-long orbital spaceflight inside the Block Obespecheniya Soderzhaniya (BOS) rodent housing. Additional details on housing and tissue collection/preparation can be found elsewhere. For the hindlimb suspension (HLS) experiments, the hindlimbs of male GSK3mKD and GSK3flox (4–6 month old) mice were suspended using a taping method where the tails of mice were taped to a copper ring attached to a steel bar that was mounted on top of a modified mouse cage. For these experiments, mice were pair-housed in the cages and had as libitum access to food and water. After 7-day of HLS, all mice were sacrificed via cervical dislocation (under isoflurane) and their tibias were collected.     For RR1, animals were euthanized via cervical dislocation with sedation followed by euthasol injection, and the soleus muscles were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C. For RR9 (CO2 euthanasia) and RR18 (cardiac puncture, ketamine/xylazine injection euthanasia), soleus muscles were fixed in RNAlater at 4C overnight, then stored at -80C. Bion-M1 animals were euthanized via cervical dislocation, and soleus samples were stored at -80C. For HLS mice, after 7-day of HLS, all mice were sacrificed via cervical dislocation (under isoflurane) and their soleus muscle was collected and used immediately for muscle contractility, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for Western blot, and fixed in OCT for histology, then stored at -80C.     Soleus muscle contractility was assessed in a bath composed of 121 mM NaCl2, 5 mM KCl, 24 mM NaHCO3, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 0.4 mM NaH2PO4, 5.5 mM glucose, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.5 mM MgCl2, and pH 7.3, that was maintained at 25°C using an Aurora Scientific contractile apparatus with a biphasic simulator (model 305B and 701B) and primary Standard 5% CO2 balance.     Soleus muscles were subjected to a force frequency curve (1, 20, 40, 80 and 160) with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. For force-frequency analysis, peak isometric force was obtained. Cross-sectional area (CSA) was calculated using the following formula: CSA equals m/l*d*(Lf/Lo), where m, muscle mass (mg); l, muscle length (mm); d, mammalian skeletal muscle density (1.06 mg/mm3); Lf/Lo is the fiber length-to-muscle length ratio (0.71 for soleus). Specific force was calculated by normalizing peak isometric force by CSA.     For each muscle, 2–3 images were randomly taken and the CSA of 20 fibers per mouse (n of 3–4 per group) were obtained using ImageJ. For central nuclei counts, the total number of fibers from the Hematoxylin and Eosin images were counted, ranging from 150 to 230 fibers per image and the number of fibers with central nuclei calculated as a percent of the total number of fibers within the image.     Soleus muscles embedded in O.C.T. matrix from GSK3mKD and GSK3flox HLS mice were processed into 10 mm cryosections prior to undergoing Hematoxylin and Eosin staining.",

          "Study Description": "We examined the effects of ~30 days of spaceflight on glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) content and inhibitory serine phosphorylation in murine muscle and bone samples from four separate missions (BION-M1, Rodent Research missions RR1, RR9, and RR18). Spaceflight reduced GSK3b content across all missions, whereas its serine phosphorylation was elevated with RR18 and BION-M1. The reduction in GSK3b was linked to the reduction in type IIA fibers commonly observed with spaceflight as these fibers are particularly enriched with GSK3. We then tested the effects of inhibiting GSK3 before this fiber type shift, and we demonstrate that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased muscle mass, preserved muscle strength, and promoted the oxidative fiber type with Earth-based hindlimb unloading. In bone, GSK3 activation was enhanced after spaceflight; and strikingly, muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion increased bone mineral density in response to hindlimb unloading. Thus, future studies should test the effects of GSK3 inhibition during spaceflight. This study derives results from the Western Blot, Histology, and Muscle Contractility assays using soleus tissue from the RR1, RR9, RR18, and Bion-M1 missions and hindlimb unloaded/suspended (HLU/HLS) animals. The soleus data in this study are related to other studies using data from the same experiment; OSD-654 (Tibia), OSD-660 (Tibialis Anterior), OSD-661 (Lumbar Spine), OSD-663 (Femur), and OSD-664 (Extensor Digitorum Longus).",

Additional details on housing and tissue collection/preparation can be found elsewhere. In addition to the F, GC, and VIV groups, we also received two cohort control groups from the RR9 mission. Owing to Hurricane Irma (September 2017), the original RR9 GC and VIV experiments were terminated early. GC and VIV experiments were replicated in May 2018 using the same strain of mice used for the flight experiment. With the new GC and VIV groups, an additional set of mice were used as cohort controls to assess variation because of differences in time. That is, the mice originally dedicated to serve as the VIV group in 2017 were labeled as cohort 1, and another set of age- and sex-matched mice were run as cohort 2 under similar treatments in 2018. For the hindlimb suspension (HLS) experiments, the hindlimbs of male GSK3mKD and GSK3flox (4–6 month old) mice were suspended using a taping method where the tails of mice were taped to a copper ring attached to a steel bar that was mounted on top of a modified mouse cage.

For RR9 femurs, samples were dissected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored at -80C. For HLS animals, DXA Scans were performed on anesthetized animals, and femurs were collected after euthanasia.     A small animal DXA scanner (OsteoSys InSIGHT, Scintica) was used to scan the individual femur bones collected from the RR9 mission. Overall coefficient of variation of our analysis was 1.7% for BMD and 3.2% for BMC. In addition, we also performed region-specific BMD analysis for the tibia, femur, and lumbar spine from mobile and HLS GSK3mKD and GSK3flox mice.

          "Study Protocol Description": "Twenty (20) mice (female, 10 B6129SF2/J Wild Type (WT) and 10 B6;129S2-Cdkn1atm1Tyj/J (p21-null), 14-15 weeks old) were launched in one Transporter on SpaceX-21 (SpX-21) on December 6, 2020. The Flight (FL) mice were transferred into two Rodent Habitats upon arrival to the International Space Station (ISS) and were maintained in microgravity for 28-29 days. At 7 days before euthanasia (December 26 and 27, 2020), all 20 mice received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection with the bone formation marker (Calcein). At about 48±2 hours before euthanasia (December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2021), all 20 mice received an IP injection with a second dose of Calcein as well as the cell proliferation marker (BrdU). At approximately 28-29 in microgravity (January 2 and 3, 2021), the Flight mice were euthanized with a Ketamine/Xylazine cocktail, followed by cardiac puncture and thoractomy. Following skin removal, both hindlimb quarters were removed and preserved or fixed. Each carcass was wrapped in aluminum foil, preserved in the CryoChiller, and stored at -80C or colder until return to PI. Two other groups of mice, 20 for Ground Control (GC) and 24 for Vivarium Control (VC), half B6129SF/J Wild Type (WT) and half B6;129S2-Cdkn1atm1Tyj/J (p21-null), were selected by the PI and underwent the same procedures and treatment as the Flight group but with an offset of 3 days. In addition to the IP injections (Calcein and BrdU) described above, all mice in the FL, GC, and VC groups also received a pre-flight subcutaneous injection of the bone marker (Alizarin Red). Twenty (20) female mice (half WT and half p21-null) were selected by the PI for the Baseline Control (BL) group. Following a successful Launch, baseline animals were injected with Calcein at the time of Launch (7 days prior to dissection) and at 48±2 hours before dissection. BL animals were also injected with BrdU at 48±2 hours before dissection. Baseline dissections were performed 7 days after launch following the same procedures used for the Flight animals. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     At the end of RR-10 experiment, all frozen carcasses and preserved hindlimbs were returned to the PI. In May 2021, the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) team performed complex, integrated dissections at NASA Ames Research Center with the Principal Investigator team. Colon tissues were preserved in RNAlater after dissection. Samples were kept at -80C freezer until processing. GeneLab only processed 9 FLT samples (4 WT and  5 p21-null), 10 GC samples (5 WT and 5 p21-null), 10 VIV samples (5 WT and 5 p21-null), and 10 BSL samples (5 WT and 5 p21-null) in this dataset.     RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following GeneLab SOP 3.1-Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini with Qiagen RNase-Free DNase set. Homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 20 mg of tissue was isolated using a scalpel, weighed and immediately placed in 600 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix (Navy, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 3 minutes at 4C and speed on 12 per SOP 2.1-Tissue homogenization Using Bullet Blender Gold Bead Beater. Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 4C and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. Supernatant corresponding to 20mg of tissue from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 uL RNAse-free water and DNA was eluted in 50 uL RNAse-free water. Concentration for all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR kit following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat 4456739, v92), Mix 1 or Mix 2, were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol. Protocol followed is SOP 5.2 Use of ERCC Spike-In Mixes and UMRR/UHRR Controls for Total RNA Sequencing. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA ribo depletion and library preparation was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN greater than 4. Index adapters used were at 1.5 uM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit. Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scentific, Waltham, MA) following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as following: Read 1: 151bp, Index1: 17bp, Index2: 8bp Read 2:151bp. PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.4/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

Following removal of hindlimbs, carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, preserved in the CryoChiller, and stored at -80 C or colder until return to Earth. In addition to the Flight group, three ground control groups were also part of the study: Basal (representing the pre-launch state), Vivarium (standard vivarium housing for the same duration of time as flight), and Ground (flight habitat in the International Space Station Environment Simulator, ISSES). Twenty mice (10 of each strain) were included in each of these control groups (except Vivarium which included 12 of each strain). These were treated, euthanized and processed on the same schedule and in the same manner as the flight samples. This study includes bulk RNA sequencing ribodepleted gene expression data from 10 Basal animals (5 WT and 5 p21-null), 9 Flight animals (4 WT and 5 p21-null), 10 Ground animals (5 WT and 5 p21-null), and 10 Vivarium animals (5 WT and 5 p21-null).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Twenty (20) mice (male, C57BL/6J, 16-17 weeks old) were launched in one Transporter on SpaceX-21 (SpX-21) on December 6, 2020. The Flight mice were transferred into two Rodent Habitats upon arrival to the International Space Station (ISS) and were maintained in microgravity for 38 days. The Flight mice were transferred into a Transporter and returned to Earth for Live Animal Return (LAR) on SpX-21 (January 13th, 2021). After Atlantic Ocean splashdown, the LAR Flight mice were transported via helicopter to Kennedy Space Center. Collectively, 20 Flight, 20 HGC, and 20 VGC mice were transferred from Rodent Transporters (Flight and HGC) or vivarium cages (VGC) and placed into shipping containers. All 60 mice were flown via charter plane to the PI’s institution, Texas A and M University (TAMU). The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol (Protocol number RR-23) was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     All post-flight euthanasia and dissections were performed by the PI team at TAMU. The original plan was to perform all pre-flight and post-flight activities at Roskamp Institute in Sarasota, Florida.  Due to the health risks associated with travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, HRP approved all post-flight activities at TAMU, which significantly decreased or eliminated travel for the PI, BSP, and Payload Developer (PD) teams. Upon arrival at the TAMU Animal Care Facility (ACF), the mice underwent post-flight procedures, followed by euthanasia and tissue collection by the PI team. GeneLab only processed 9/9/9 samples from Flight/HGC/VGC groups in this dataset.     RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Universal Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Approximately 20mg of tissue was used, weighed, and immediately placed in 800 uL of the QIAzol buffer solution. Homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix SSB14B, a mix of stainless steel beads of 0.9-2mm (Next Advance, Raymertown, NY) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance, Raymertown, NY) for 5 minutes at 4oC, speed of 12 per SOP 2.1-Tissue homogenization Using Bullet Blender Gold Bead Beater.

Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Two separate libraries were made from the same extracted RNA pool for samples RR23_R-Quad_FLT_F1 and RR23_R-Quad_GC_G1, to give technical replicates 1 and 2 for each sample. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.

In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0), ERCC genes were removed, and the non-ERCC genes were normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. For samples with technical replicates, only the first replicate was used for count normalization and differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1).

          "Study Protocol Description": "Twenty (20) mice (male, C57BL/6J, 16-17 weeks old) were launched in one Transporter on SpaceX-21 (SpX-21) on December 6, 2020. The Flight mice were transferred into two Rodent Habitats upon arrival to the International Space Station (ISS) and were maintained in microgravity for 38 days. The Flight mice were transferred into a Transporter and returned to Earth for Live Animal Return (LAR) on SpX-21 (January 13th, 2021). After Atlantic Ocean splashdown, the LAR Flight mice were transported via helicopter to Kennedy Space Center. Collectively, 20 Flight, 20 HGC, and 20 VGC mice were transferred from Rodent Transporters (Flight and HGC) or vivarium cages (VGC) and placed into shipping containers. All 60 mice were flown via charter plane to the PI’s institution, Texas A and M University (TAMU). The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol (Protocol number RR-23) was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     All post-flight euthanasia and dissections were performed by the PI team at TAMU. The original plan was to perform all pre-flight and post-flight activities at Roskamp Institute in Sarasota, Florida. Due to the health risks associated with travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, HRP approved all post-flight activities at TAMU, which significantly decreased or eliminated travel for the PI, BSP, and Payload Developer (PD) teams. Upon arrival at the TAMU Animal Care Facility (ACF), the mice underwent post-flight procedures, followed by euthanasia and tissue collection by the PI team. GeneLab only processed 9/9/9 samples from Flight/HGC/VGC groups in this dataset.     RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Universal Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Approximately 10mg of tissue was used, weighed, and immediately placed in 850 uL of the QIAzol buffer solution. Homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix SSB14B, a mix of stainless steel beads of 0.9-2mm (Next Advance, Raymertown, NY) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance, Raymertown, NY) for 5 minutes at 4oC, speed of 12 per SOP 2.1-Tissue homogenization Using Bullet Blender Gold Bead Beater. Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 minutes at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 30 uL RNAse free H2O. Concentration for all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR kit following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat 4456739, v92), Mix 1 or Mix 2, were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol.

GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA ribo depletion and library preparation was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN greater than 8. Index adapters used were at 1.5 uM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit. Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Two separate libraries were made from the same extracted RNA pool for samples RR23_R-EDL_FLT_F1, RR23_R-EDL_GC_G1, and RR23_R-EDL_VIV_V1, to give technical replicates 1 and 2 for each sample. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as following: Read 1: 151bp, Index1: 17bp, Index2: 8bp Read 2:151bp. PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.2 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.2/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0), ERCC genes were removed, and the non-ERCC genes were normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. For samples with technical replicates, only the first replicate was used for count normalization and differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis_GLbulkRNAseq.html report.",

To this end, twenty male, C57BL/6J, 16-17 weeks-old mice were delivered to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX-21 in a single transporter, transferred to two rodent habitats, and maintained in microgravity for 38 days. Flight mice were then returned to Earth alive (January 13th, 2021). After splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean, mice were transported to Kennedy Space Center via helicopter. The 20 Flight, 20 Habitat Ground Control (HGC), and 20 Vivarium Ground Control (VGC) mice were removed from Rodent Transporters (Flight and HGC) or vivarium cages (VGC), placed into shipping containers, and flown to Texas A and M University. There, mice underwent post-flight procedures, before euthanasia and tissue collection. Flight, HGC and VGC animals were euthanized and dissected on Jan 14th, 17th or 20th of 2021, respectively. Right extensor digitorum longus muscle samples were preserved by immersion in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C until RNA was extracted, and libraries generated and sequenced (target 60 M clusters per sample, PE 150 bp). This dataset features 9 samples from the Flight group, 9 samples from the Habitat Ground Control group, and 9 samples from the Vivarium Ground Control group.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Micro-computed tomography (mCT, SkyScan 1176 V.1.1 build 12, Bruker microCT, Belgium) was performed as previously described. Following euthanasia, the right tibia was excised, cleaned of surrounding tissue, and wrapped in parafilm wax to prevent moisture loss throughout the duration of the 180-degree high resolution (9 mm) scan. A 0.25 mm aluminum filter was applied. The beam strength was set at 45 kV and 545 mA for an exposure time of 850 ms. Trabecular bone region of interest began 0.855 mm from the point in which the primary spongiosa disconnects and formation of the growth plate is evident and expanded 0.675 mm toward the tibia midpoint. Trabecular bone was manually delineated from the cortical bone and quantified using an adaptive thresholding of 49 to determine total volume, bone volume, bone volume fraction, trabecular thickness, trabecular separation, trabecular number, degree of anisotropy, and connectivity density. For cortical bone structure analysis, the tibia midpoint was used to define the region of interest (0.450 mm toward the proximal and distal ends; total height of 0.900 mm). Cortical bone structure outcomes, including total cross-sectional area, cortical area, cortical area fraction, cortical thickness, periosteal perimeter, endocortical perimeter, medullary area, and eccentricity, were calculated using an adaptive threshold of 67.     Resulting images were reconstructed (smoothing kernel equals 2, ring artifact reduction equals 8, beam hardening equals 30%, and dynamic image range equals 0.000–0.155; NRecon V.1.7.3.1 software, Bruker microCT, Belgium) into 3D images and reoriented in anatomical position (DataViewer V.1.5.6.2 64-bit software, Bruker microCT, Belgium) for consistency when selecting the regions of interest. Quantification of trabecular and cortical bone structure outcomes was performed at the proximal tibia and tibia midpoint, respectively.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.     A small animal DXA scanner (OsteoSys InSIGHT, Scintica) was used to scan the individual femur bones collected from the RR9 mission. Overall coefficient of variation of our analysis was 1.7% for BMD and 3.2% for BMC. In addition, we also performed region-specific BMD analysis for the tibia, femur, and lumbar spine from mobile and HLS GSK3mKD and GSK3flox mice.     Tibia samples were obtained from the RR9 mission through the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection. We were provided with 3 experimental groups: 1) Flight (F) group housed in specialized mission hardware; 2) Ground control (GC) housed in specialized mission hardware here on Earth; and 3) Vivarium (VIV) control housed in standard laboratory cages and conditions. For the NASA missions, male C57BL/6J (RR9 and RR18, 10 weeks of age at time of launch) mice were acclimated and then launched in a specialized transporter and transferred to Rodent Habitats on board the International Space Station (ISS). Additional details on housing and tissue collection/preparation can be found elsewhere. In addition to the F, GC, and VIV groups, we also received two cohort control groups from the RR9 mission. Owing to Hurricane Irma (September 2017), the original RR9 GC and VIV experiments were terminated early. GC and VIV experiments were replicated in May 2018 using the same strain of mice used for the flight experiment. With the new GC and VIV groups, an additional set of mice were used as cohort controls to assess variation because of differences in time. That is, the mice originally dedicated to serve as the VIV group in 2017 were labeled as cohort 1, and another set of age- and sex-matched mice were run as cohort 2 under similar treatments in 2018. For the hindlimb suspension (HLS) experiments, the hindlimbs of male GSK3mKD and GSK3flox (4–6 month old) mice were suspended using a taping method where the tails of mice were taped to a copper ring attached to a steel bar that was mounted on top of a modified mouse cage. For these experiments, mice were pair-housed in the cages and had as libitum access to food and water. After 7-day of HLS, all mice were sacrificed via cervical dislocation (under isoflurane) and their tibias were collected.     After dissection, RR9 tibias were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 48 hours, then stored at 4 degrees celsius in 70% EtOH. For HLS mice, after 7-day of HLS, all mice were sacrificed via cervical dislocation (under isoflurane) and their tibias were collected.",

          "Study Description": "We examined the effects of ~30 days of spaceflight on glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) content and inhibitory serine phosphorylation in murine muscle and bone samples from four separate missions (BION-M1, Rodent Research missions RR1, RR9, and RR18). Spaceflight reduced GSK3b content across all missions, whereas its serine phosphorylation was elevated with RR18 and BION-M1. The reduction in GSK3b was linked to the reduction in type IIA fibers commonly observed with spaceflight as these fibers are particularly enriched with GSK3. We then tested the effects of inhibiting GSK3 before this fiber type shift, and we demonstrate that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased muscle mass, preserved muscle strength, and promoted the oxidative fiber type with Earth-based hindlimb unloading. In bone, GSK3 activation was enhanced after spaceflight; and strikingly, muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion increased bone mineral density in response to hindlimb unloading. Thus, future studies should test the effects of GSK3 inhibition during spaceflight. This study derives results from the DXA and micro computed tomography assays using tibia tissue from the RR9 mission and hindlimb unloaded/suspended (HLU/HLS) animals. The tibia data in this study are related to other studies using data from the same experiment; OSD-660 (Tibialis Anterior), OSD-661 (Lumbar Spine), OSD-662 (Soleus), OSD-663 (Femur), and OSD-664 (Extensor Digitorum Longus).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "A bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay was used to determine sample protein concentration using an M2 Molecular Devices Plate Reader (Molecular Devices). All Western blots used BioRad TGX 4–15% gradient gels (4561086: BioRad) and PVDF membranes. Samples were then prepped and equally loaded for gel electrophoresis.     Transfer was conducted via BioRad Transblot Turbo.     Following transfer, membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBST for 60 min or BioRad Every Blot blocking buffer (12010020) for 10 min.     Antibodies from pGSK3b (9336), total (t)-GSK3-b (9315), pGSK3a (9316), tGSK3a (4818), b-Catenin (8480) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). MHC I (BA-F8), IIa (SC-71), IIx (6H1), and IIb (BF-F3) antibodies as well as the antibodies for Pax7 (AB_528428) and myogenin (F5D) were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa). The antibodies for FNDC5 and COXIV were obtained from Abcam (ab13190 and abS16056, respectively) and the antibody for PGC-1a was obtained from Millipore (ST1204). Following blocking, the appropriate primary antibody was appropriately diluted and added during an overnight incubation at 4C. After incubation with appropriate primary antibodies membranes were washed 3 times for 5 min with TBST then incubated for 60 min with the analogous secondary anti-mouse (7076; Cell Signaling Technology; MHC I, IIa, IIx, IIb) or anti-rabbit (7074; Cell Signaling Technology; p-GSK3a, GSK3a p-GSK3b, GSK3b, b-catenin) antibody both conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Upon secondary incubation, membranes were washed another 3 times with TBST for 5-min each.     Millipore Immobilon ( WBKLSO500) chemiluminescent substrate was added and then visualized using a BioRad ChemiDoc MP for protein detection.     Ponceau staining was used for protein normalization (59803; Cell Signaling Technology).     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.     Tibialis anterior samples were obtained from the RR9 mission through the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection. We were provided with 3 experimental groups: 1) Flight (F) group housed in specialized mission hardware; 2) Ground control (GC) housed in specialized mission hardware here on Earth; and 3) Vivarium (VIV) control housed in standard laboratory cages and conditions. For the NASA missions, male C57BL/6J (RR9 and RR18, 10 weeks of age at time of launch) mice were acclimated and then launched in a specialized transporter and transferred to Rodent Habitats on board the International Space Station (ISS). Additional details on housing and tissue collection/preparation can be found elsewhere. In addition to the F, GC, and VIV groups, we also received two cohort control groups from the RR9 mission. Owing to Hurricane Irma (September 2017), the original RR9 GC and VIV experiments were terminated early. GC and VIV experiments were replicated in May 2018 using the same strain of mice used for the flight experiment. With the new GC and VIV groups, an additional set of mice were used as cohort controls to assess variation because of differences in time. That is, the mice originally dedicated to serve as the VIV group in 2017 were labeled as cohort 1, and another set of age- and sex-matched mice were run as cohort 2 under similar treatments in 2018.     Upon live return, mice were euthanized with 100% CO2. Left tibialis anterior from RR9 were dissected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C in a 1.8 mL cryotube.",

          "Study Description": "We examined the effects of ~30 days of spaceflight on glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) content and inhibitory serine phosphorylation in murine muscle and bone samples from four separate missions (BION-M1, rodent research [RR]1, RR9, and RR18). Spaceflight reduced GSK3b content across all missions, whereas its serine phosphorylation was elevated with RR18 and BION-M1. The reduction in GSK3b was linked to the reduction in type IIA fibers commonly observed with spaceflight as these fibers are particularly enriched with GSK3. We then tested the effects of inhibiting GSK3 before this fiber type shift, and we demonstrate that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased muscle mass, preserved muscle strength, and promoted the oxidative fiber type with Earth-based hindlimb unloading. In bone, GSK3 activation was enhanced after spaceflight; and strikingly, muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion increased bone mineral density in response to hindlimb unloading. Thus, future studies should test the effects of GSK3 inhibition during spaceflight. This study derives results from the Western blot assay using tibialis anterior tissue from the RR9 mission. The tibialis anterior data in this study are related to other studies using tissues from the same experiment; OSD-654 (tibia), OSD-661 (lumbar spine), OSD-662 (soleus), OSD-663 (femur), and OSD-664 (extensor digitorum longus).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "In the Rodent Research Reference Mission (RRRM-2), forty female C57BL/6NTac mice were flown on the International Space Station. To assess differences in outcomes due to age, twenty 12 week-old and twenty 29 week-old mice were flown, respectively. To directly assess spaceflight effects, half of the young and old mice (10 old, 10 young) were sacrificed on-orbit after 55-58 days (ISS Terminal, ISS-T), while the other half (10 old, 10 young) were returned live to Earth after 32 days and allowed to recover for 24 days (Live Animal Return, LAR) before sacrifice. ISS-T and LAR mice were the same age at sacrifice. Both the ISS-T and LAR animals had independent ground controls (10 mice per group housed in flight hardware in matched environmental conditions), basal controls (10 mice per group sacrificed 2 days before launch), and vivarium controls (10 mice per group housed within standard vivarium habitats). Thus RRRM-2 included a total of 160 mice. GeneLab only processed up to 5 mice from each of the young/old group from flight/ground control groups in this dataset. All mice (C57BL/6NTac) were sourced from Taconic Biosciences (Germantown, NY). Mice were weighed, chipped with BMDS RFID chip (IMI-500) and shipped to NASA KSC for delivery at approximately L-5 weeks. Mice were housed and maintained in the Animal Care Facility (ACF) at NASA KSC with 12:12 light cycle matched in timing to the light cycle used for Transporters and Habitats programmed for flight. All mice were housed in cages of 5 mice/cage with the same littermates as they had been raised. Mice were initially given ad lib standard lab chow and water, which was changed on a schedule of 2x per week. Mice were housed initially on standard bedding and provided with igloo as enrichment material. Animal health was checked daily by appropriately trained NASA personnel and contracted lab technicians. At L-4 weeks, mice were placed on raised mesh flooring to simulate spaceflight Transporter and Habitat cage conditions, given water delivered through lixits identical to those used in the flight hardware and put on the NASA Nutrient-Upgraded Rodent Foodbars (NuRFB). Food and water were changed weekly, and mice were weighed bi-weekly. Igloo was provided as enrichment material in all cages. At L-12 days, mice were grouped (10 mice per cage) in larger cages for social acclimation prior to launch. Groupings were done based on age of animals and in a manner to establish similar average weights between any given grouping. At L-2 days, baseline, spaceflight and ground control groups were identified. At L-1 day, spaceflight animals were loaded into spaceflight Transporters. Habitat Ground Control (HGC) mice were loaded into Transporters on a 3-day offset from spaceflight animals. Vivarium Ground Control (VGC) mice (also on a 3-day offset) were returned to 5 mice/cage and placed on standard bedding and provided water through typical sipper tubes at launch equivalent. All mice were maintained on NuRFB throughout the duration of the study. Spaceflight and HGC mice were given new food at weekly intervals. VGC mice were given new food and fresh water also on weekly intervals. An enrichment Hut, in the form of a grated shelter, was provided in the habitat for the flight and habitat ground control group. Igloo was provided in the vivarium ground control group. After splashdown, flight LAR mice were transferred to the animal care facility at Scripps Research Institute where they were assessed and re-caged into standard caging conditions (5 mice/cage, standard bedding and ad lib water from regular sipper tubes). LAR and ISS-T Ground Control mice were shipped from Kennedy Space Center to Scripps and housed under the same conditions as the flight mice. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     For ISS terminal (ISS-T) group, mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and euthanized by means of cardiac puncture blood draw (exsanguination) and double thoracotomy. A list of tissues including brain were dissected fresh from each carcass. The left brain hemisphere was dissected and placed directly in a cryotube and rapidly frozen using the ISS rapid freeze system. The samples were maintained at -80C until the day of nuclei isolation and nucleic acid extraction.     On the day of nuclei isolation, the hemisphere was placed in a plastic weigh boat on a pre-cooled metal stage on dry ice and sectioned coronally using two cuts to generate a 30mg (+/-5mg) sized slice that included the region between sections 74 – 60 in Allen Brain Atlas (mouse, P56, coronal), without allowing the sample to thaw. The resulting slice encompassed areas of the hippocampus, ventricles, amygdala, hypothalamus, midbrain, and striatum. To isolate nuclei, Chromium Nuclei Isolation Kit with RNase Inhibitor (10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA) was used. All buffers were kept on ice until needed. Up to 6 samples were processed at once. Approximately 30mg of brain tissue was isolated, using a cold blade, and immediately placed in 200uL of freshly made lysis buffer in tissue dissociation tubes set on ice. To dissociate the tissue, plastic pestle was used to grind through the tissue in the lysis buffer until homogeneous. 300uL of fresh lysis buffer was added to each sample and pipette mixed 10 times. All samples were incubated on ice for 10 minutes and then transferred into pre-chilled Nuclei Isolation Column assembled with Collection Tube. Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 rcf for 20 seconds at 4C. The columns were discarded, samples vortexed and then centrifuged again for 3 minutes at 500 rcf at 4C. Supernatant was carefully discarded. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 500uL of Debris Removal Buffer by gentle pipetting and the tubes were centrifuged at 700 rcf for 10 minutes at 4C. Supernatant was discarded and to wash the nuclei pellet, it was resuspended in 1mL of Wash Buffer and then centrifuged at 500 rcf for 5 minutes, supernatant discarded. Additional 1mL wash was performed and the supernatant discarded. Washed nuclei were resuspended in 150uL of Resuspension Buffer and kept on ice. To count the nuclei, 20uL of nuclei suspension was combined with 40uL of 4uM EthD-1 stain. Stained samples were incubated for 15-25 minutes and were evaluated and counted using a haemocytometer on a Leica DMi8 microscope with TXR fluorescent filter. Cell suspension volume corresponding to 6,000 nuclei was carried over into the 10X Chromium workflow. GeneLab only processed samples from 4 young ISS-T spaceflight animals, 5 old ISS-T spaceflight animals, 5 young ISS-T ground control animals, and 4 young ISS-T ground control animals.     10X Genomics procedure for library preparation with Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression was followed (10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA), since this kit can be used for either isolated nuclei or cells. Nuclei suspension was incubated in a Transposition Mix to fragment the DNA in open regions of the chromatin. Simultaneously, partial adapter sequences were added. Using the Chromium Controller (10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA), the nuclei were encapsulated in Gel bead-in-Emulsion, or GEMs, with each GEM individually tagged with one of 750,000 independent 10X barcodes. Multiome ATAC+GEX Gel Beads include both a)Poly (dT) sequences that are associated with full length cDNA from poly-A mRNA for gene expression (GEX) and b)Spacer sequence that enables barcode attachment to transposed DNA fragments for ATAC-Seq library. Within the GEM’s, reverse transcriptase reaction took place and Illumina P5 sequence, 16nt 10X barcode (ATAC and GEX), Illumina TruSeq Read 1 sequencing primer, 12nt unique molecular identifier (UMI) and 30nt poly(dT) sequence all anneal to either the transposed DNA fragments or mRNA fragments that get transcribed to cDNA. Incubation in the GEM’s produces 10X barcoded DNA from transposed DNA (ATAC) and 10X barcoded, full length cDNA from poly-A mRNA (GEX). Following reverse transcription and barcoding, a quenching reaction took place and the GEMs were ruptured to release the content. Barcoded fragments were recovered and clean-up was conducted using DynaBeads MyOne Silane magnetic beads followed by SPRISelect (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN) clean up and size selection. Fragments were amplified to increase yield, 7 amplification cycles were completed using the provided reagents and the amplified product was cleaned and size selected by SPRISelect (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN) beads. Amplified product included transposed DNA fragments used for subsequent ATAC-Seq library preparation and barcoded cDNA fragments for gene expression library preparation. To complete the ATAC-Seq library construction, 40uL of each of the transposed DNA samples were combined with Sample Index PCR Mix that includes Illumina P7 sequence. Individual Sample Indexes from 10X plate N, Set A were also added to the PCR reaction. Fully barcoded and indexed libraries were amplified for 8 amplification cycles. ATAC-Seq library size selection and clean-up was conducted using SPRISelect (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN) beads. Sequencing libraries were quantified using Qubit 4 instrument (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter and library quality was assessed with TapeStation 4200 instrument (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) with D1000 or D1000 HS DNA ScreenTape Analysis assay. Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as following: Read 1: 28 bp, Index 1: 10 bp, Index 2: 10 bp. Read 2: 91 bp. PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     DNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as following: Read 1: 51 bp, Index 1: 8 bp, Index 2: 24 bp, Read 2: 51 bp. PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs. Published data files reflect the following read lengths post processing: Read 1 (forward): 51 bp, Read 2 (10X barcode): 24 bp, Read 3 (reverse): 51 bp.     Raw fastq files for the 4 indices for each sample were concatenated together to create one set of fastq files per sample. Concatenated raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     On the day of nucleic acid extraction, the left hemisphere was placed in a plastic weigh boat on a pre-cooled metal stage on dry ice and the frontal lobe of left hemisphere sectioned using cuts to generate a 20 mg sized tissue. All the sample processing were kept consistent, without allowing the sample to thaw. RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following GeneLab SOP 3.1-Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini with Qiagen RNase-Free DNase set. Homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 20 mg of tissue was isolated using a scalpel, weighed, and immediately placed in 700 µL of the Buffer RLT solution. Homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix red, (Next Advance, Raymertown, NY) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance, Raymertown, NY) for 3 minutes at 4 ˚C per SOP 2.1-Tissue homogenization Using Bullet Blender Gold Bead Beater. Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 minutes at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 µL RNAse free H2O, and DNA was eluted in 50 µL RNAse free H2O. Concentration for all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR kit following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). DNA quality and size were assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with Agilent gDNA ScreenTape Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). GeneLab only processed samples from 4 young ISS-T spaceflight animals, 5 old ISS-T spaceflight animals, 5 young ISS-T ground control animals, and 4 young ISS-T ground control animals. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat 4456739, v92), Mix 1 or Mix 2, were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol. SOP 5.2 Use of ERCC Spike-In Mixes and UMRR/UHRR Controls for Total RNA Sequencing. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA ribo depletion and library preparation was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) following GeneLab SOP 5.1 Ilumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Lirary Prep using epMotion. Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN greater than 4. Index adapters used were at 1.5 µM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit. Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scentific, Waltham, MA) following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as following: Read 1: 151 bp, Index1: 17 bp, Index2: 8 bp, Read 2: 151 bp. PhiX v3 was included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) were incorporated into the read headers of raw fastq files using UMI-tools version 1.1.2. Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on May-2024. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Samples with total read pairs exceeding 150 million were downsampled to 150 million read pairs with seqtk (version 1.4-r122).     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.1 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.1/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0), ERCC genes were removed, and the non-ERCC genes were normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis_GLbulkRNAseq.html report.",

To assess differences in outcomes due to age, twenty 12 week-old and twenty 29 week-old mice were flown, respectively. To directly assess spaceflight effects, half of the young and old mice (10 old, 10 young) were sacrificed on-orbit after 55-58 days (ISS Terminal, ISS-T), while the other half (10 old, 10 young) were returned live to Earth after 32 days and allowed to recover for 24 days (Live Animal Return, LAR) before sacrifice. ISS-T and LAR mice were the same age at sacrifice. Both the ISS-T and LAR animals had independent ground controls (10 mice per group housed in flight hardware in matched environmental conditions), basal controls (10 mice per group sacrificed 2 days before launch), and vivarium controls (10 mice per group housed within standard vivarium habitats). Thus RRRM-2 included a total of 160 mice. This study includes bulk RNA sequencing and single nuclei transcriptomics and epigenomics from left cerebral hemispheres from 4 young ISS-T spaceflight animals, 5 old ISS-T spaceflight animals, 5 young ISS-T ground control animals, and 4 young ISS-T ground control animals.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Twenty (20) mice (female, 10 B6129SF2/J Wild Type (WT) and 10 B6;129S2-Cdkn1atm1Tyj/J (p21-null), 14-15 weeks old) were launched in one Transporter on SpaceX-21 (SpX-21) on December 6, 2020. The Flight (FL) mice were transferred into two Rodent Habitats upon arrival to the International Space Station (ISS) and were maintained in microgravity for 28-29 days. At 7 days before euthanasia (December 26 and 27, 2020), all 20 mice received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection with the bone formation marker (Calcein). At about 48±2 hours before euthanasia (December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2021), all 20 mice received an IP injection with a second dose of Calcein as well as the cell proliferation marker (BrdU). At approximately 28-29 days in microgravity (January 2 and 3, 2021), the Flight mice were euthanized with a Ketamine/Xylazine cocktail, followed by cardiac puncture and thoracotomy. Following skin removal, both hindlimb quarters were removed and preserved or fixed. Each carcass was wrapped in aluminum foil, preserved in the CryoChiller, and stored at -80C or colder until return to PI. Two other groups of mice, 20 for Ground Control (GC) and 24 for Vivarium Control (VC), half B6129SF/J Wild Type (WT) and half B6;129S2-Cdkn1atm1Tyj/J (p21-null), were selected by the PI and underwent the same procedures and treatment as the Flight group but with an offset of 3 days. In addition to the IP injections (Calcein and BrdU) described above, all mice in the FL, GC, and VC groups also received a pre-flight subcutaneous injection of the bone marker (Alizarin Red). The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). GeneLab only processed samples from 5 WT FL  mice and 5 WT GC mice in this dataset.     At the end of RR-10 experiment, all frozen carcasses and preserved hindlimbs were returned to the PI. In May 2021, the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) team performed complex, integrated dissections at NASA Ames Research Center with the Principal Investigator team. The brains were bisected into 2 hemispheres. The left hemisphere was preserved in LN2 and stored at -80C until the day of nuclei isolation and nucleic acid extraction.     On the day of nuclei isolation, the left hemisphere was placed in a plastic weigh boat on a pre-cooled metal stage on dry ice and sectioned coronally using two cuts to generate a 30mg (+/-5mg) sized slice that included the region between sections 74 – 60 in Allen Brain Atlas (mouse, P56, coronal), without allowing the sample to thaw. The resulting slice encompassed areas of the hippocampus, ventricles, amygdala, hypothalamus, midbrain and striatum. To isolate nuclei, Chromium Nuclei Isolation Kit with RNase Inhibitor (10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA) was used. All buffers were kept on ice until needed. Up to 6 samples were processed at once. Approximately 30mg of brain tissue was isolated, using a cold blade, and immediately placed in 200uL of freshly made lysis buffer in tissue dissociation tubes set on ice. To dissociate the tissue, plastic pestle was used to grind through the tissue in the lysis buffer until homogeneous. 300uL of fresh lysis buffer was added to each sample and pipette mixed 10 times. All samples were incubated on ice for 10 minutes and then transferred into pre-chilled Nuclei Isolation Column assembled with Collection Tube. Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 rcf for 20 seconds at 4C. The columns were discarded, samples vortexed and then centrifuged again for 3 minutes at 500 rcf at 4C. Supernatant was carefully discarded. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 500uL of Debris Removal Buffer by gentle pipetting and the tubes were centrifuged at 700 rcf for 10 minutes at 4C. Supernatant was discarded and to wash the nuclei pellet, it was resuspended in 1mL of Wash Buffer and then centrifuged at 500 rcf for 5 minutes, supernatant discarded. Additional 1mL wash was performed and the supernatant discarded. Washed nuclei were resuspended in 150uL of Resuspension Buffer and kept on ice. To count the nuclei, 20uL of nuclei suspension was combined with 40uL of 4uM EthD-1 stain. Stained samples were incubated for 15-25 minutes and were evaluated and counted using a haemocytometer on a Leica DMi8 microscope with TXR fluorescent filter. Cell suspension volume corresponding to 6,000 nuclei was carried over into the 10X Chromium workflow. GeneLab only processed the 5 samples (WT) from spaceflight group and 5 samples (WT) from ground control group in the single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell ATAC-seq datasets.     10X Genomics procedure for library preparation with Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression was followed (10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA), since this kit can be used for either isolated nuclei or cells. Nuclei suspension was incubated in a Transposition Mix to fragment the DNA in open regions of the chromatin. Simultaneously, partial adapter sequences were added. Using the Chromium Controller (10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA), the nuclei were encapsulated in Gel bead-in-Emulsion, or GEMs, with each GEM individually tagged with one of 750,000 independent 10X barcodes. Multiome ATAC+GEX Gel Beads include both a)Poly (dT) sequences that are associated with full length cDNA from poly-A mRNA for gene expression (GEX) and b)Spacer sequence that enables barcode attachment to transposed DNA fragments for ATAC-Seq library. Within the GEM’s, reverse transcriptase reaction took place and Illumina P5 sequence, 16nt 10X barcode (ATAC and GEX), Illumina TruSeq Read 1 sequencing primer, 12nt unique molecular identifier (UMI) and 30nt poly(dT) sequence all anneal to either the transposed DNA fragments or mRNA fragments that get transcribed to cDNA. Incubation in the GEM’s produces 10X barcoded DNA from transposed DNA (ATAC) and 10X barcoded, full length cDNA from poly-A mRNA (GEX). Following reverse transcription and barcoding, a quenching reaction took place and the GEMs were ruptured to release the content. Barcoded fragments were recovered and clean-up was conducted using DynaBeads MyOne Silane magnetic beads followed by SPRISelect (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN) clean up and size selection. Fragments were amplified to increase yield, 7 amplification cycles were completed using the provided reagents and the amplified product was cleaned and size selected by SPRISelect (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN) beads. Amplified product included transposed DNA fragments used for subsequent ATAC-Seq library preparation and barcoded cDNA fragments for gene expression library preparation. To complete the GEX library construction, 35uL of each of the barcoded cDNA sample was amplified for 7 amplification cycles. cDNA library size selection and clean-up was conducted using SPRISelect (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN) beads. Amplified product was quantified usingTapeStation 4200 instrument (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and 25% of the amplified cDNA(10uL) was used to generate the 3’ Gene Expression library in the next steps. Fragmentation of cDNA, end repair and A-tailing was performed and the product was size selected and cleaned-up using SPRISelect (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN) beads in a double sided wash. Adaptor oligos were annealed to the cDNA fragments, product was cleaned up once more with SPRISelect beads and followed by final amplification and attachment of Illumina indexes from 10X Dual Index plate TT, set A. 15-16 amplification cycles were implemented, amount of cycles was driven by the cDNA input calculated during Post cDNA amplification QC step.\nSequencing libraries were quantified using Qubit 4 instrument (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter and library quality was assessed with TapeStation 4200 instrument (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) with D1000 or D1000 HS DNA ScreenTape Analysis assay. Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as following: Read 1: 28 bp, Index 1: 10 bp, Index 2: 10 bp. Read 2: 91 bp. PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     DNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as following: Read 1: 51 bp, Index1: 8 bp, Index2: 24 bp, Read 2: 51 bp. PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs. Published data files reflect the following read lengths post processing: Read 1 (forward): 51 bp, Read 2 (10X barcode): 24 bp, Read 3 (reverse): 51 bp.     Raw fastq files for the 4 indices for each sample were concatenated together to create one set of fastq files per sample. Concatenated raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     On the day of nucleic acid extraction, the left hemisphere was placed in a plastic weigh boat on a pre-cooled metal stage on dry ice and the frontal lobe of left hemisphere sectioned using cuts to generate a 22 mg (+/- 5mg) sized tissue. All the sample processing were kept consistent, without allowing the sample to thaw.  RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following GeneLab SOP 3.1-Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini with Qiagen RNase-Free DNase set. Homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 18-26.1 mg of tissue was isolated using a scalpel, weighed, and immediately placed in 700 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Homogenization was performed using tissue RED homogenizing bead mix, (Next Advance, Raymertown, NY) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance, Raymertown, NY) for 3 minutes at 4 ˚C per SOP 2.1-Tissue homogenization Using Bullet Blender Gold Bead Beater. Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 minutes at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 uL RNAse free H2O, and DNA was eluted in 50 uL RNAse free H2O. Concentration for all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR kit following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). DNA quality and size were assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with Agilent gDNA ScreenTape Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). GeneLab only processed the 4 samples (WT) from spaceflight group and 5 samples (WT) from ground control group in the bulkRNAseq dataset. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat 4456739, v92), Mix 1 or Mix 2, were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol. SOP 5.2 Use of ERCC Spike-In Mixes and UMRR Controls for Total RNA Sequencing. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA ribo depletion and library preparation was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) following GeneLab SOP 5.1 Ilumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep using epMotion. Input RNA were approximately 500nG with RIN greater than 4. Index adapters used were at 1.5uM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit. Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scentific, Waltham, MA) following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as following: Read 1: 151 bp, Index1: 17 bp, Index2: 8 bp Read 2: 151 bp. PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     Data from 4 spaceflight and 5 ground control wild type samples are available. Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) were incorporated into the read headers of raw fastq files using UMI-tools version 1.1.2. Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on May-2024. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Samples with total read pairs exceeding 150 million were downsampled to 150 million read pairs with seqtk (version 1.4-r122).     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.1 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.1/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0), ERCC genes were removed, and the non-ERCC genes were normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis_GLbulkRNAseq.html report.",

To this end, ten (10) 14-15 weeks-old female B6129SF2/J Wild Type (WT), and ten (10) 14-15 weeks-old female B6;129S2-Cdkn1atm1Tyj/J (p21-null) mice received a pre-flight subcutaneous injection of the bone marker (Alizarin Red), and were then delivered to the ISS aboard SpaceX-21. At 7 days before euthanasia, all 20 mice received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection with a bone formation marker (Calcein). At 48 +/- 2 hours before euthanasia, all 20 mice received an IP injection with a second dose of Calcein as well as a cell proliferation marker (BrdU). Then, following 28-29 days in microgravity, the Flight mice were euthanized. Following removal of hindlimbs, carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, preserved in the CryoChiller, and stored at -80 C or colder until return to Earth. In addition to the Flight group, three ground control groups were also part of the study: Basal (representing the pre-launch state), Vivarium (standard vivarium housing for the same duration of time as flight), and Ground (flight habitat in the International Space Station Environment Simulator, ISSES). Twenty mice (10 of each strain) were included in each of these control groups (except Vivarium which included 12 of each strain). These were treated, euthanized and processed on the same schedule and in the same manner as the flight samples. This study includes bulk RNA sequencing data from left cerebral hemispheres from 4 WT flight animals and 5 WT ground control animals, and single nuclei transcriptomics and epigenomics data from left cerebral hemispheres from 5 WT flight animals, and 5 WT ground control animals.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Six to 10 field images were captured with a BZ-X700 inverted fluorescence microscope (Keyence Corp.) at 20X magnification spanning the entire retina sections.     For quantitative analysis, numbers of TUNEL positive cells and TUNEL positive endothelial cells were counted separately. The total number of TUNEL-positive nuclear /ganglion cells or endothelial cells in the retina were counted in 5 sections from each eye. The surface of each section was measured on digital microphotographs using ImageJ v1.4 software (available as freeware from National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA; http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/), and the density profiles were expressed as mean number of apoptotic cells/mm2. The mean of the density profile measurements across 5 retina sections per eye was used as a single experimental value. To determine AQP4, ZO-1 and PECAM immunoreactivity, fluorescence intensity was measured on 6 to 10 randomly selected fields on each section and calculated using ImageJ software. Fluorescence intensities for positive cells (red channel for ZO-1 and PECAM, and green channel for AQP-4) from the areas of interest were measured and data were extracted and averaged across 5 retina sections per eye within the group.  Submitted files include all of the image metadata per image taken. Transformed files include just the averages which correspond to the sample names in OSD-583.     Vasculature was labeled with DyLight® 488 Lycopersicon Esculentum (Tomato) Lectin (1:100, Vector Laboratories) for 30 minutes at room temperature followed by 10 minutes wash in PBS. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary rabbit antibodies against CD31/PECAM-1 (1:100) (Novus Biologicals, Centennial, CO) in antibody dilution buffer (0.25% BSA, 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS). After 3 washes in PBS, sections were incubated for 1.5 hours with secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor® 568 (1:1000 in antibody dilution buffer; Life Technologies) followed by PBS washes. The cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI solution (1 µg/ml in PBS; Life Technologies) washed in PBS and coverslipped with Vectashield® HardSet mounting medium (Vector Laboratories).     Vasculature was labeled with DyLight® 488 Lycopersicon Esculentum (Tomato) Lectin (1:100, Vector Laboratories) for 30 minutes at room temperature followed by 10 minutes wash in PBS. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary rabbit antibodies against ZO-1 (1:50) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) in antibody dilution buffer (0.25% BSA, 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS). After 3 washes in PBS, sections were incubated for 1.5 hours with secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor® 568 (1:1000 in antibody dilution buffer; Life Technologies) followed by PBS washes. The cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI solution (1 µg/ml in PBS; Life Technologies) washed in PBS and coverslipped with Vectashield® HardSet mounting medium (Vector Laboratories).     Six to 10 field images were examined using a BZ-X710 All-in-One inverted fluorescence microscope with structural illumination (Keyence Corp., Elmwood Park, NJ) at 20X magnification spanning the entire retina per section.     The ocular sections were evaluated using the TUNEL assay according to standard procedures. Data were obtained for 6 ocular samples of each group. Briefly, six μm paraffin embedded sections were processed using DeadEnd™ Fluorometric TUNEL system kit (Catalog No. G3250, Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA) The same sections were then incubated with DyLight 594 Lycopersicon esculantum-Lectin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) to stain the endothelium. Nuclei were counterstained with diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, blue, Life Technologies, Eugene, Oregon). Six to 10 field images were examined using a BZ-X710 All-in-One inverted fluorescence microscope with structural illumination (Keyence Corp., Elmwood Park, NJ) at 20X magnification spanning the entire retina per section.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a Molecular Cellular Imaging (Microscopy) template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all microscopy results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.     On August 14, 2017, SpaceX successfully launched the 12th Commercial Resupply Service (CRS-12) payload at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) which included 10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (n equals 20) (Jackson laboratories, Inc. Bar harbor, ME) for NASA’s ninth Rodent Research experiment (RR-9). The mice lived in NASA’s Rodent Habitats (RH) aboard ISS for 35 days before returning to Earth via SpaceX’s Dragon capsule. All mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26–28 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle during the flight. GC mice were placed into the same housing hardware used in flight, and environmental parameters such as temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels were kept equivalent to that of FLT mice based on 48 h delayed telemetry data. GC mice were fed the same reformulated rodent food bar diet approved by NASA as the space flown mice. Consumption of food and water was monitored daily throughout this study. Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Loma Linda University (LLU) and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and activities involving vertebrate animals are carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Due to Hurricane Irma’s impact on KSC in September, 2017, experiments with both GC and GV control groups were cancelled and later rescheduled for May, 2018, using mice of the same strain, sex, age and animals were from the same holding room from the vendor that were used for the flight experiments. This resulted in a large time gap between tissue collection for the flight and KSC ground control groups. Consequently, the FV cohort-matched control group was added to the study to help control for possible differences associated with this delay. Tissue collection with the FV group were conducted several days after studies with the FLT animals were concluded.     Post-flight evaluation of the mice. Upon return to the Earth, mice were transported to LLU within 28 hours of splashdown. At LLU, animals were removed from the animal enclosure hardware and assessed for survival and health. The inspecting personnel reported that all the mice survived the 35-day space mission and were in good condition, i.e. no obvious deficiencies/abnormalities. Within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized. The mice were rapidly euthanized in 100% CO2. The left eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for immunohistochemistry (IHC; microscopy) assays.",

          "Study Description": "The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and re-measured before the mice were euthanized after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4–19.3 mmHg vs 16.3–20.3 mmHg) (p less than 0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups (p less than 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight.  This dataset derives results from Molecular Cellular Imaging (Microscopy) assay.",

Upon return to the Earth, mice were transported to Loma Linda University (LLU) within 28hours of splashdown.

It was reported that all the mice survived the 35-day space mission and were in good condition, i.e. no obvious deficiencies/abnormalities as described by the inspecting personnel.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation. *No active dosimetry in US Lab for this period; data from RR-5 (June-July 2017) Start transfer to return vehicle 9/15/17 09:18. For duration use launch-to-splashdown -1 hour. (See note on dose estimates for LAR.)     The mice were rapidly euthanized in 100% CO2 and eyes were collected within 38 plus or minus 4 hours of splashdown (n equals 20/group). The retinas from rights were dissected and placed individually in sterile cryovials, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 degrees C prior to use. The left eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 24 hours and then rinsed with PBS for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. The retinas were flash-frozen and stored at −80 degrees C for genomic analysis.     Samples were scanned using a high resolution micro-computed tomography system (SkyScan 1272 desktop micro-CT system, Bruker, Kontich, Belgium), with an accelerating source voltage of 50 keV, a source current of 80 mA with an integration time of 90 min. During the scanning process, the samples were rotated at 180 degrees, with an imaging voxel size of 4.5 um, frame averaging of 4, rotation step of 0.4 and no filter.     A subset of eye samples (n equals 6/group) were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS. After fixation, the mice eyes were dehydrated in ethanol. To prevent an abrupt shrinkage of the fixed sample, a graded series of ethanoic solutions were used. Afterwards, the mice eyes were stained in 10% phosphomolybdic acid solution (PMA) for 6 days. Samples were washed in absolute ethanol and then placed each eye in the same rotation in individual 2 mL plastic containers filled with absolute ethanol for scanning.     These images were saved for the reconstruction of the 3D object. The thickness of the retina and surrounding tissues were measured on MicroCT images by descriptive analysis. Measurements of the lens, retina, RPE layer, choroid and sclera were performed in the middle slice of the sagittal view of each sample using the optical nerve as reference. Three measurements were recorded of each structure to finally obtain an average. In addition to the raw image files, reconstructed data files were added to the study. F10_Rec.zip contains the Primary Reconstructions, F10.zip contains the Sagittal Reconstructions, F10_Sagital.zip contains the Sagittal-Transverse View, and F10_Axial.zip contains the Sagittal-Sagittal View.

The mice were rapidly euthanized in 100 percent CO2 and eyes were collected within approximately 38 hours of splashdown (n equals  20 per group). The retinas from rights were dissected and placed individually in sterile cryovials, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 degrees Celsius prior to use. The left eyes were fixed in 4 percent paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 24 hours and then rinsed with PBS for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. Paraffin-embedded sections (six um) of left eye, roughly 100 mm apart, were used for analysis (n equals 6 per group).     To characterize layers of retinal structure, a series of 6 um sections were also stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H and E).     To characterize layers of retinal structure, a series of 6 um sections were also stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H and E). Images were captured with a BZ-X710 All-in-One inverted fluorescence microscope.

Paraffin-embedded sections (six um) of left eye, roughly 100 mm apart, were used for analysis (n equals 6 per group). To evaluate oxidative damage in the retina, Immunostaining was performed on ocular sections using 4-HNE antibody specific for lipid peroxidation. Sections were incubated with the anti-4-HNE antibody (catalog no. HNE11-S, Alpha Diagnostic International Inc., San Antonio, TX) at 4 degrees Celsius for 2 hours followed by a donkey anti-rabbit IgG fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody (catalog no. A21206, Invitrogen Corp., Waltham, MA) for 2 hours at room temperature and counterstained with DAPI. For double labeling of HNE and PNA, sections were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated Peanut agglutinin (1:100 in 1% BSA) for an hour at room temperature for labeling the photoreceptor cones. Sections were then incubated overnight (18-21 hours) at 4 degrees Celsius with primary antibody against rabbit anti-4-HNE (Alpha Diagnostic Intl. Inc. San Antonio, TX). After washing three times in PBS, sections were further treated with secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies, Eugene, Oregon).     The cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI and were mounted and coverslipped with Vectashield Hard-Set Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories). Images were captured with a BZ-X710 All-in-One inverted fluorescence microscope. In each sample, a total of 5 fields of images were sampled systematically at 20X magnification spanning the entire retina sections. To determine HNE immunoreactivity, fluorescence intensity was measured on 5 randomly selected fields on each section and calculated using Image J software. The data were extracted and averaged within the group.     The mice were rapidly euthanized in 100 percent CO2 and eyes were collected within approximately 38 hours of splashdown (n equals  20 per group). The retinas from rights were dissected and placed individually in sterile cryovials, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 degrees Celsius prior to use. The left eyes were fixed in 4 percent paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 24 hours and then rinsed with PBS for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. Paraffin-embedded sections (six um) of left eye, roughly 100 mm apart, were used for analysis (n equals 6 per group).     For labeling of PNA, sections were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated Peanut agglutinin (1:100 in 1% BSA) for an hour at room temperature for labeling the photoreceptor cones. Sections were then incubated overnight (18-21 hours) at 4 degrees Celsius. After washing three times in PBS, sections were further treated with secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies, Eugene, Oregon). PNA was obtained from (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI.     The cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI and were mounted and coverslipped with Vectashield Hard-Set Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories). Images were captured with a BZ-X710 All-in-One inverted fluorescence microscope. In each sample, a total of 5 fields of images were sampled systematically at 20X magnification spanning the entire retina sections. For quantitative analysis, the number of PNA- positive cells were counted in three sections of tissue from each animal using Image J counting plugin 1.41 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). The density profiles were expressed as mean number of PNA cells/mm2, and counts were averaged across each group.",

          "Study Description": "Extended spaceflight has been shown to adversely affect astronaut visual acuity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight alters gene expression profiles and induces oxidative damage in the retina. Ten week old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS for 35 days and returned to Earth alive. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Within 38 (+/−4) hours after splashdown, mice ocular tissues were collected for analysis. RNA sequencing detected 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in murine spaceflight retinas, which were enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. Twelve DEGs were associated with retinitis pigmentosa, characterized by dystrophy of the photoreceptor layer rods and cones. Differentially expressed transcription factors indicated changes in chromatin structure, offering clues to the observed phenotypic changes. Immunofluorescence assays showed degradation of cone photoreceptors and increased retinal oxidative stress. Total retinal, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid layer thickness were significantly lower after spaceflight. These results indicate that retinal performance may decrease over extended periods of spaceflight and cause visual impairment. This dataset is from the micro-computed tomography, immunostaining, and histology assays.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "The calvariae were frozen in liquid nitrogen and shipped under dry ice to our laboratory at University of California, San Diego for analysis. It should be noted that the STS-131 mission originally carried eleven adult, female, wild-type C57BL/6 mice. However, only seven were included in the current study. One calvaria suffered multiple bone fractures from inappropriate handling and storage, and was deemed unsuitable for analysis. Three were euthanized 28 h after landing instead of within 4 h, and thus were not included in our analysis. Although the addition of these three calvariae would greatly increase the sample size, we felt that since the length of stay in microgravity was only fifteen days, the three calvariae extracted after experiencing Earth's gravity for more than one entire day may not truly reflect microgravity-induced changes and may instead introduce bias to the analysis of the samples. To compensate for this decision, we also excluded three of the eleven ground control mice with the same number of caged days prior to euthanasia.     Experimental protocol conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and was approved by the Institutional and Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Prior to experiments, all animals were deemed healthy by the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) veterinarians.\n\nSeven 23-week-old adult, female, wild-type C57BL/6 mice representing the spaceflight group (n equals 7) experienced fifteen days of microgravity aboard the 15-day NASA shuttle mission STS-131. Eight female wild-type C57BL/6 mice, littermates of the spaceflight group, were maintained on land under normal gravitational loads and represent the control group (n equals 8). Both groups were maintained on a 12:12-hour light–dark cycle and provided with pre-adapted food and water ad libitum, from April 4 to 20, 2010 for the flight mice and from April 6 to 22, 2010 for the ground controls. Both groups were housed in Animal Enclosure Modules with gravity or lack thereof being the primary environmental difference. All mice were weighed twice – once just prior to cage-loading, and again after cage-unloading at the termination of the 15-day period and prior to sacrifice – and the weight change of each animal was determined.\n\nAfter mission completion, the spaceflight mice were received and euthanized at the NASA Kennedy Space Center, and their tissues were harvested within 3 to 4 h of shuttle landing. The ground control mice were identically housed for the duration of the STS-131 mission beginning 48 h after launch, and were  euthanized at the termination of their experimental duration 48 h after shuttle landing. All animals were handled and dissected by members of the Biospecimen Sharing Project at NASA-KSC.     Samples were thawed and imaged on a micro-Computed Tomography scanner, Skyscan 1076 (Kontich, Belgium). Calvariae were wrapped in tissue paper moistened with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and scanned at 9μm voxel size, applying an electrical potential of 50 kVp and current of 200uA, and using a 0.5mm aluminum filter. Tissue Mineral Density (TMD) was determined by calibration of images against 2mm diameter hydroxyapatite (HA) rods (250 and 750 mg/cm3) with a beam hardening correction algorithm applied during image reconstruction.     Bone structure and histomorphometric parameters were visualized and determined using Skyscan software, Dataviewer, CTAn (Kontich, Belgium). A volume of interest (VOI, defined by a standardized rectangular volume measuring 18mm3, 5.5mm × 1.2mm area in the coronal plane, 2.7mm depth) was located at the center of the parietal bones by identifying the intersection of the anterior lambdoid and coronal sutures with the sagittal suture to position the center of the VOI on the sagittal plane and localizing the VOI center on the coronal plane at the sagittal suture. After applying a global threshold, an erosion of one pixel was performed to eliminate partial volume effects. The following parameters were then calculated: total volume (TV, defined as the VOI), bone volume (BV, defined as the volume within the VOI occupied by bone), bone volume fraction (BV/TV, defined as the proportion of the VOI occupied by bone, expressed as a percentage), cross-sectional bone thickness (Cs.Th, measured as the thickness of the calvaria from the edge of cortical bone underlying the scalp to overlying the meninges, calculated in 2D on the basis of the plate model), and tissue mineral density (TMD, determined by\ncalibration of the attenuation values to those obtained from the HA rods).     The content for this dataset was extracted from a meta-analysis performed by the authors of Fu et al., 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-021-00147-7). The purpose of the meta-analysis was to mine the literature in order to quantify microgravity-induced changes to bone health in animals. The authors provided to ALSDA a global dataset, based upon 40 different literature-derived articles. In collaboration with the authors and the ALSDA Analysis Working Group (AWG), these datasets were then parsed into individual 'original' files of data. This 'original' data file is made available (so users can see original version). To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a microCT data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all microCT results to be identically structured for efficient data mining. Of note, these values are groups of sample, with 'sample name 1' (group 1) having an N of 7, and 'sample name 2' (group 2) having an N of 8.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.",

          "Study Description": "Bone growth may occur in spaceflight as a response to skeletal unloading and head-ward fluid shifts. While unloading causes significant loss of bone mass and density in legs of animals exposed to microgravity, increased blood and interstitial fluid flows accompanying microgravity-induced fluid redistribution may elicit an opposite effect in the head. Seven 23-week-old, adult female wild-type C57BL/6 mice were randomly chosen for exposure to 15 days of microgravity on the STS-131 mission, while eight female littermates served as ground controls. Upon mission completion, all 15 murine calvariae were imaged on a micro-computed tomography scanner. A standardized rectangular volume was placed on the parietal bones of each calvaria for analyses, and three parameters were determined to measure increased parietal bone volume: bone volume (BV), average cortical thickness (Ct.Th), and tissue mineral density (TMD). Microgravity exposure caused a statistically significant increase in BV of the spaceflight (SF) group compared to that of the ground control (GC) group, the mean BV ± SD for the SF group was 1.904 ± 0.842 mm3, compared to 1.758 ± 0.122 mm3 for the GC group (p less than 0.05). Ct.Th demonstrated a trend of increase from 0.099 ± 0.006 mm in the GC group to 0.104 ± 0.005 mm in the SF group (p equals 0.12). TMD was similar between the two groups with 0.878 ± 0.029 g/cm3 for the GC group and 0.893 ± 0.028 g/cm3 for the SF group (p equals 0.31). Our results indicate that microgravity causes responsive changes in calvarial bones that do not normally bear weight. These findings suggest that fluid shifts alone accompanying microgravity may initiate bone adaptation independent of skeletal loading by tissue. This dataset was derived from the literature, and contains only grouped mCT data from the calvaria.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "One fecal pellet (equivalent in mass) was used per mouse for DNA extraction and bacterial DNA was isolated using the QIAGEN Power Fecal DNA isolation kit (QIAGEN, Cat. No. 12955-4) with bead beating. Total DNA isolated for 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was also utilized for metagenomic sequencing. Oral samples collected via Plasdent Maxaplicator Super fine (2 mm) swabs were used for collection (MPN 600-R-2). Oral Swab DNA samples were processed using the Lucigen - Master Pure DNA isolation kit (Ca. No. MC85200).     Whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing was performed at the University of Washington's Northwest Genomics Center (NWGC) on 10 biological replicates for both ISS and ISS_G rodents respectively (N equals 20). Sequencing libraries were generated using KAPA HTP Library Preparation Kits (07961901001, Roche) and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 System using a S Prime flow cell configured for 300 cycles which resulted in a total of 1,342,813,654 reads with an average of 70,674,403 reads per sample. Raw paired-end reads were then filtered, trimmed for quality, and screened against a mouse (C57BL) reference database using kneadData (McIver et al., 2018).     Utilizing kraken2 v2.1.1, a human genome reference database was constructed from NCBI's RefSeq (GCF_000001405.39) GRCh38.p13, with --no-masking, and defaults of kmer-length 35 and minimizer-length of 31. FASTQ files were screened against this database, and all successfully classified reads were removed.     Utilizing kraken2 v2.1.1, a mouse genome reference database was constructed from NCBI's RefSeq (GCF_000001635.27) GRCm39, with --no-masking, and defaults of kmer-length 35 and minimizer-length of 31. FASTQ files were screened against this database, and all successfully classified reads were counted and reported as a percentage of the total.     Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.11. Quality-trimming and filtering was performed with bbmap v38.86. Read-based processing was performed with humann v3.6. Individual samples were assembled with megahit v1.2.9. Genes were called with prodigal v2.6.3. Taxonomic classification of genes and contigs was performed with CAT v5.2.2. Functional annotation was done with KOFamScan v1.3.0. Reads were mapped to assemblies with bowtie2 v2.3.5.1, and coverage information was extracted for reads and contigs with samtools v1.9 and bbmap v38.86. Binning of contigs was performed with metabat2 v2.15. Bins were summarized with bit v1.8.53 and estimates of quality were generated with checkm v1.1.3. High-quality bins (greater than 90% est. completeness and less than 10% est. redundancy) were taxonomically classified with gtdb-tk v1.5.0.     The sequencing of the V1-V3 region (Allen et al., 2016) of 16S rRNA gene was completed using a custom protocol (F. Escapa et al., 2020) and on the Illumina Mi-Seq platform.     Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7104-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Metagenomics/Illumina/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7107_Versions/GL-DPPD-7107.md), using workflow SW_AmpIllumina v1.0.0 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/SW_AmpIllumina-A_1.0.0/Amplicon/Illumina/Workflow_Documentation/SW_AmpIllumina-A). Quality assessment of filtered reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.9. Primers were already removed from the submitted raw data. The raw data had 101 bp R1 reads and 401 bp R2 reads. Due to relatively poor quality of the R2 reads, and because for many recovered sequences the paired reads did not span the target amplicon (exploration of this can be found in the general-processing-notes.txt file packaged with in the V1V3-processing_info.zip archive), only the R1 reads were processed – which in this case extended into the V3 region back from the reference 518 position. DADA2 v1.20.0 was utilized for quality-trimming and filtering and inference of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), and taxonomy was assigned with DECIPHER v2.20 using the SILVA r138 reference database.     The sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was then performed as previously described (Tong et al., 2014). The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and barcoded using 515f/806r primers then 2x150bp (paired-end) sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Caporaso et al., 2012).     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7104-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Metagenomics/Illumina/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7107_Versions/GL-DPPD-7107.md), using workflow SW_AmpIllumina v1.0.0 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/SW_AmpIllumina-A_1.0.0/Amplicon/Illumina/Workflow_Documentation/SW_AmpIllumina-A). Quality assessment of filtered reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.9. Primers were already removed from the submitted raw data. DADA2 v1.20.0 was utilized for quality-trimming and filtering and inference of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), and taxonomy was assigned with DECIPHER v2.20 using the SILVA r138 reference database.     The analysis of the mouse blood serum metabolome targeted three different classes of molecules that each used different sample preparation and LC-MS/MS protocols: regular polar metabolites (Group 1), carbonic acids (Group 2), and glycols (Group 3). All samples were extracted in a randomized order. First, a stock extract for the three downstream methods was prepared by mixing 5 ul mouse blood serum with 20 ul methanol. The mixtures were precipitated at -20 C for 2 hours, 10 min at 20,000  g and 4 C and supernatants were transferred into new Eppendorf tubes. For regular polar metabolites (Group 1), 2.5 ul extract were mixed with 50 ul 0.1 % (v/v) formic acid, centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 _ g and 4 C, transferred into glass vials, and injected (5 ul) directly into the LC-MS/MS system. Carbonic acids (Group 2) were derivatized using the 2-Hydrazinoquinoline-method established by (Lu et al., 2013). Specifically, 2.5 ul serum extract were mixed with 500 nmol 13C,D4-acetic acid isotope in 50 ul freshly prepared derivatization mix (1 mM 2-hydrazinoquinoline, 1 mM 2,2'-dipyridil disulfide, and 1 mM triphenylphosphine in acetonitrile). The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at 60 C, chilled on ice, and quenched with 50 ul H2O. After centrifugation at 20,000  g and 4 C for 5 min, samples were transferred into glass vials and 10 ul aliquots used for LC-MS/MS-analysis. Glycols (Group 3) were prepared according to (Imbert et al., 2014). 2.5 ul blood serum extracts were spiked with 2.5 nmol D4-1,4-butanediol isotope in 7.5 ul water. Then, 10 ul 4 M NaOH were added and mixed with 5 ul benzoyl chloride followed by 5-minute incubation at room temperature. The derivatization reaction was stopped by adding 5 ul 5 % (w/v) glycine. Samples were vortexed, incubates for 5 min and the glycol derivatives extracted with 200 ul propane. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C and 20,000  g, supernatants transferred into a fresh Eppendorf tube and evaporated in a SpeedVac to complete dryness. After reconstitution in 50 ul buffer (50 % acetonitrile, 50 % water, 10 mM ammonium formate pH 2.5), insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and 10 ul aliquots subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis.     Targeted quantitation was performed on a SCIEX QTRAP 6500 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (SCIEX, Framingham, MA, USA) equipped with an Ion Drive Turbo V ESI source and a Shimadzu Nexera XR HPLC system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Details of the respective HPLC methods and instrument parameters are summarized in Table S15. For polar metabolites (Group 1), a Poroshell 120 EC-C18 (4.6x100 mm, 2.7 um particle size; Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, California)) guarded by a Security Guard Ultra C18 precolumn (Phenomenex, Torrance, California) was used for reverse phase separation as described (Schulte et al., 2020). Derivatized carbonic acids were separated using an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1x50 mm, 1.7 um particle size; Waters Corporation (Milford, Massachusetts)) hyphenated to a KrudKatcher Ultra HPLC In-Line Filter (0.2 um depth x 0.004 inch) as previously described (Lu et al., 2013). Glycol derivatives were separated using an Atlantis dC18 column (2.1 x 150 mm, 3 um particle size; Waters Corp.) protected by a KrudKatcher Ultra HPLC In-Line Filter (0.2 um depth x 0.004 inch) according to (Imbert et al., 2014). The mass spectrometer was optimized for the detection of each molecule to obtain maximum intensity (polarity, collision energy, precursor and product ion selection). Samples were analyzed in randomized order and quality control standards were injected at regular intervals during and between analysis batches to monitor instrument performance (analyte separation and detection). Calibration standards were prepared by serial-dilution of stock solutions containing 64 compounds for polar metabolites, 4 carbonic acids, and 3 glycols. The carbonic acid and glycol standards were derivatized at the same time as the respective sample batches as described above. Calibration curves were collected over a concentration range of 100,000 to 0.0001 nmol using 5 and 10 uL injection volumes. All stock solutions were aliquoted and stored at -20 C until used.     The objective of the Rodent Research-5 (RR-5) study was to evaluate bone loss in mice under microgravity conditions and to determine if treatment with NELL1 can reduce or prevent bone loss that would otherwise occur in microgravity. Bone loss assessments include measuring a combination of blood markers, micro Computed Tomography (uCT), Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA), and bone histomorphometry. Forty mice (female; BALB/c; 30 weeks old; Taconic), launched in two Transporters (20 mice per), then were transferred to Rodent Habitats onboard the International Space Station (ISS) and maintained in microgravity for ~30 days until Live Animal Return (N of 20; LAR to UCLA) or for ~9 weeks total which were ISS Terminal (N of 20; IT). There was a Baseline of subjects at KSC. A Ground Control group mimicked LAR, which was housed at KSC, then shipped live to UCLA. There was a Ground Control group at KSC which mimicked flight. All animals were kept on a temperature controlled (~28C), 12-hr Light/Dark Cycle. There were two treatment groups: control (saline vehicle [10 mg/kg in 0.3 mls], and experimental NELL1 [10 mg/kg in 0.3 mls]). Alizarin red or calcein green bone label markers were administered as well (respectively 50 mg/kg, 0.1 mls and 20 mg/kg, 0.1 mls). Injections of vehicle, NELL1, and bone markers were intraperitoneal (i.p.).  The mice were injected 6-8 days after launch and at two week (+/- 1day) intervals thereafter. During the first set of injections (L+6-8 days), only NELL1 or vehicle was injected (no bone marker). Two or three treatments were administered to all 40 mice on orbit, depending on Dragon berth duration.  Twenty mice, at just prior to Dragon unberth (Spx-11), were transferred to a Dragon and transported live back to Earth (LAR). An additional two treatments were administered to the 20 mice that remained aboard the ISS. The 20 mice kept aboard the ISS, at ~L+4 to 5 weeks, were anesthetized via i.p. injection of ketamine/xylazine, DXA scanned, and then recovered via injection of atipamazole. At L+9 weeks the ISS mice were anesthetized (Ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine) and DXA scanned. Blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture through closed chest. Animals were euthanized by exsanguination and cervical dislocation. One hind limb was dissected from each animal and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF). The NBF was removed and replaced with 70% ethanol after 5-6 days of fixation. The blood was separated by centrifugation, and tubes were frozen and stored at -80C or colder. Each carcass was wrapped in aluminum foil and placed in -80C storage or colder until return. All the samples analyzed in this dataset were collected from saline vehicle treated animals.     Fecal Sample collection: Nominally, two freshly harvested fecal samples or more per mouse (in individual, autoclaved cages) were collected and placed in 2.0 mL sterile, nuclease free (RNAase/DNAase), non-pyrogenic, polypropylene Corning Cyrogenic vials. Samples were promptly flash frozen with liquid nitrogen for 15 minutes - one hour (within 15 minutes or less of collection) and stored in a -80C freezer. One fecal pellet (equivalent in mass) was used per mouse for DNA extraction and sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was then performed as previously described (Tong et al., 2014). Oral Sample collection: The molars, cheeks and tongue (lingual and buccal) regions of the LAR and LAR_G rodents (3 swabs per mouse within each cage) were used as a consistent anatomical position for oral microbiome sampling. The rodents were anesthetized via isoflurane and sampled. Specifically, Plasdent Maxaplicator Super fine (2 mm) swabs were used for collection (MPN 600-R-2). Plasma serum was isolated as described in (Kwak and Zhang et al. 2022)",

The NASA led Rodent Research 5 mission enabled an ancillary investigation of the gut microbiome varying exposure to microgravity (flight) relative to ground controls in the context of previously shown bone mineral density (BMD) loss that was observed in these flight groups. We demonstrate elevated abundance of Lactobacillus murinus and Dorea sp. during microgravity exposure relative to ground control through whole genome sequencing and 16S rRNA analyses. Specific functionally assigned gene clusters of Lactobacillus murinus and Dorea sp. capable of producing metabolites, lactic acid, leucine/isoleucine, and glutathione are enriched. These metabolites are elevated in the microgravity-exposed host serum through LC-MS/MS metabolomic analysis. Along with BMD loss, ELISA analysis reveals increases of osteocalcin and reductions in tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b signifying additional loss of bone homeostasis in flight.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Gait analysis was performed longitudinally on left limbs using the portable DigiGait System (Mouse Specifics, Quincy, MA). Approximately 8 days prior to launch (L-8) or enrollment in the study for two of the control groups, pre-flight baseline gait measures were collected from all mice. At L-7, six cages of mice were grouped into the three different groupings, with 2 cages per group; whole cages were grouped instead of random selection of individuals to avoid complications related to an altered hierarchical structure within cages. Nine-week old male mice were grouped as follows: mice to be sent to ISS (FLIGHT; n equals 20); ground-based habitat controls (Ground Control, GC; n equals 20) to be placed in environmental chambers replicating the environmental conditions for the FLIGHT mice aboard ISS, including similar NASA Type 12 Nutrient-upgraded Rodent Food Bars, temperature, humidity, and CO2 partial pressure; or controls to be housed in standard vivarium housing in the animal facility (Vivarium, VIV; n equals 20). At L-1, the 10-week old FLIGHT mice were loaded into a transporter, with both original cage grouping of n equals 10 isolated from the others due to a separator in the transporter (again to prevent aggression), and then loaded into the Dragon SpaceX Capsule. Mice were transferred to two Rodent Habitats aboard ISS, n equals 10 per habitat. Unberthing from ISS and splashdown of live mice occurred on L+34, and the live mice were collected by the science teams on L+35 for behavioral and functional testing (deemed: Post-flight) at Loma Linda Medical Center.     For the DigiGait system, the mouse is constrained within a chamber above the belt. To improve the rapidity at which data across cohorts could be collected; modifications to the chamber were made which increased the speed at which mice could be retrieved post-trial. A 5 cm tall x 10 cm wide gap was cut into the side of the chamber where the edges were smoothed for the animal's well-being. An anti-escape animal transfer unit (AeATU) was designed and constructed that was placed over the gap in the side of the chamber, with a sliding door mechanism pressed against the gap to prevent egress during trial runs. At the end of each trial, the door is slid open, and rapid egress of the subject occurs into the darkened box, to be returned to its cage. This modification resulted in a total time from the removal of the mouse from the cage, through data acquisition, and return to cage of approximately 1.5–5 min per mouse. Recordings of the footfall patterns were assessed for quality and truncated to a minimum criterion of 6 consecutive, non-interrupted strides. After this, the data was imported into the DigiGait Analysis v.14 software where spatial and temporal measurements were extracted from the video.     The system's speed is precisely controlled, thereby eliminating variability associated with self-selected walking speeds. Mice do not need acclimation; walking at 17 cm/s occurs upon initiating the treadmill, which is an acceptable speed for characterizing patterns related to motor deficits. The parameters that were selected for analysis were those that have been reported by other manuscripts utilizing the DigiGait to measure gait changes so that comparisons could be made. For example, we measure paw angle and absolute paw angle. Paw angle is measured by degrees of change alongside the long axis of the direction of motion during animals stride. By using this range of motion, there could be negative and positive angles, when alignment along the plane would be considered 0° The absolute paw angle is used to convert the negative angles into a degree change of motion.     All studies were approved by the NASA Ames Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), Kennedy Space Center IACUC, and the Loma Linda Medical Center IACUC. Gait analyses were performed on male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Labs) that spent ~35 days in microgravity aboard ISS as part of the Rodent Research (RR)-9 mission in August 2017. The experiment was launched as part of the SpaceX Commercial Resupply Services (CRS)−12 mission from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) at Cape Canaveral, FL to the ISS. Four weeks prior to launch (L) or enrollment in the study (L-28), mice arrived at the KSC and were maintained on a 12:12 h dark/light cycle, and housed in standard vivarium caging (n equals 10/cage). Due to the effects of a natural disaster (Hurricane Irma), the longitudinal gait assessments on mice launched to the ISS were performed Aug-Sept 2017, while longitudinal gait assessments for two control groups were performed May-June, 2018. Approximately 8 days prior to launch (L-8) or enrollment in the study for two of the control groups, pre-flight baseline gait measures were collected from all mice. At L-7, six cages of mice were grouped into the three different groupings, with 2 cages per group; whole cages were grouped instead of random selection of individuals to avoid complications related to an altered hierarchical structure within cages. Nine-week old male mice were grouped as follows: mice to be sent to ISS (FLIGHT; n equals 20); ground-based habitat controls (Ground Control, GC; n equals 20) to be placed in environmental chambers replicating the environmental conditions for the FLIGHT mice aboard ISS, including similar NASA Type 12 Nutrient-upgraded Rodent Food Bars, temperature, humidity, and CO2 partial pressure; or controls to be housed in standard vivarium housing in the animal facility (Vivarium, VIV; n equals 20).

Unberthing from ISS and splashdown of live mice occurred on L+34, and the live mice were collected by the science teams on L+35 for behavioral and functional testing (deemed: Post-flight) at Loma Linda Medical Center. Immediately after gait analysis, tissue was harvested.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a behavior (gait) reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all behavior (gait) results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.",

While post-flight gait change in astronauts have been well documented and reflect multi-system deficits, no data from rodents have been collected. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate gait changes in response to spaceflight. A prospective collection of gait data was collected on 3 groups of mice: those who spent~35 days in orbit (FLIGHT) aboard the International Space Station (ISS); a ground-based control with the same habitat conditions as ISS (Ground Control; GC); and a vivarium control with typical rodent housing conditions (VIV). Pre-flight and post-flight gait measurements were conducted utilizing an optimized and portable gait analysis system (DigiGait, Mouse Specifics, Inc). The total data acquisition time for gait patterns of FLIGHT and control mice was 1.5–5 min/mouse, allowing all 20 mice per group to be assessed in less than an hour. Patterns of longitudinal gait changes were observed in the hind limbs and the forelimbs of the FLIGHT mice after ~35 days in orbit; few differences were observed in gait characteristics within the GC and VIV controls from the initial to the final gait assessment, and between groups. For FLIGHT mice, 12 out of 18 of the evaluated gait characteristics in the hind limbs were significantly changed, including: stride width variability; stride length and variance; stride, swing, and stance duration; paw angle and area at peak stance; and step angle, among others. Gait characteristics that decreased included stride frequency, and others. Moreover, numerous forelimb gait characteristics in the FLIGHT mice were changed at post-flight measures relative to pre-flight. This rapid DigiGait gait measurement tool and customized spaceflight protocol is useful for providing preliminary insight into how spaceflight could affect multiple systems in rodents in which deficits are reflected by altered gait characteristics. This dataset derives results from the behavior (gait) assay.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Flight animals were sacrificed 4-6 hours after landing. Additional ground-based ovary-intact rats (n equals 18) were evaluated. The ovary-intact animals represent reserve rats to be used if the originally planned flight had been delayed. Since the mission was carried out as anticipated, these animals were maintained in a vivarium and sacrificed to provide age-matched reference values for baseline (n equals 8, 12 weeks old) and flight (n equals 10, 14 weeks old). The purpose of the ovary-intact controls was 2-fold: 1) to evaluate normal age-related changes in bone over the 2 week flight period, and 2) to verify that ovariectomies (OVX) resulted in anticipated cancellous osteopenia. This dataset is only the data from OVX animals. All rats were sacrificed by decapitation and bones were harvested and placed in 70% ethanol for analysis.     Second lumbar vertebrae from 11 rats per group were available for evaluation. The bones were prepared for histological analysis as described. In brief, specimens were dehydrated in increased concentrations of ethanol and embedded in a mixture of methyl methacrylate and 2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate (in a 12.5:1 ratio). Five-micrometer-thin sections were then cut on a microtome (model 2065, Reichert-Jung, Heidelberg, Germany) and stained with toluidine blue (Sigma Chemical, St Louis, MO, USA). The staining technique allowed simultaneous quantification of cells and fluorochrome label.\n\nThe effects of spaceflight on bone resorption and osteoblast turnover were evaluated using a novel approach. Specifically, the preflight fluorochrome label was used to identify bone perimeter undergoing mineralization in preflight animals experiencing normal weight bearing. Because preflight fluorochrome label perimeter is assumed to be similar in the rats randomly assigned to a group (ground control or flight), post-flight differences in label length represent intergroup differences in bone resorption during flight. In turn, the perimeter bounded by preflight label with adjacent osteoblasts represents continuous bone formation throughout the duration of flight, whereas fluorochrome label with no adjacent osteoblasts reflects sites undergoing bone mineralization at the time of label administration but not subsequently (ceased bone formation). In contrast, bone perimeter bounded by osteoblasts with no adjacent label represents sites where bone formation was newly initiated during flight (i.e., following administration of the preflight label). Cell and fluorochrome data were simultaneously collected by viewing the sections under combined visible light and ultraviolet light using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics, Atlanta, GA, USA). Endpoints evaluated included bone area fraction (bone area/tissue area, area of total\ntissue evaluated occupied by cancellous bone, %), fluorochrome label length (length/tissue area, mm/mm2) and osteoclast perimeter (osteoclast\nperimeter/bone perimeter, %). Fluorochrome-based indices of bone formation included measurements of continuous bone formation during\nflight (percentage of bone lined with osteoblasts associated with the single label; %), ceased bone formation during flight (percentage of bone\nperimeter with label not associated with osteoblasts, %), newly initiated bone formation during flight (percentage of osteoblast perimeter not\nassociated with label, %) and mineral apposition rate (mean distance between the fluorochrome marker and osteoblast-lined perimeter divided\nby number of days between the label injection and killing (15 days), μm/day). MAT (% tissue area) and adipocyte number ( /mm2) were measured and adipocyte size (μm2) was determined by dividing MAT by adipocyte number.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a bone histomorphometry data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures/parameters). This enables all histomorphometry results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.     Twelve-week-old female Fischer 344 rats (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) were used in the study. The animals were maintained in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the experimental protocol was approved by the NASA and Mayo Clinic Animal Care and Use Committees. The rats were ovx 14 days prior to launch and randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: 1) ground-based flight control (ground control, n equals 12), or 2) spaceflight (flight, n equals 12). The flight animals were flown on the Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-62) for 14 days. Flight and ground control animals were housed in animal enclosure modules (AEM) with 6 rats/AEM. The AEMs were maintained at 28 °C. All animals were provided with food (Teklad L356 food bars; Teklad Inc., Madison, WI) and water ad libitum.",

          "Managing NASA Center": "Ames Research Center (ARC)",
          "Study Description": "There is often a reciprocal relationship between bone marrow adipocytes and osteoblasts, suggesting that marrow adipose tissue (MAT) antagonizes osteoblast differentiation. MAT is increased in rodents during spaceflight but a causal relationship between MAT and bone loss remains unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of a 14-day spaceflight on bone mass, bone resorption, bone formation, and MAT in lumbar vertebrae of ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Twelve-week-old OVX Fischer 344 rats were randomly assigned to a ground control or flight group. Following flight, histological sections of the second lumbar vertebrae (n equals 11/group) were stained using a technique that allowed simultaneous quantification of cells and preflight fluorochrome label. Compared with ground controls, rats flown in space had 32% lower cancellous bone area and 306% higher MAT. The increased adiposity was due to an increase in adipocyte number (224%) and size (26%). Mineral apposition rate and osteoblast turnover were unchanged during spaceflight. In contrast, resorption of a preflight fluorochrome and osteoclast-lined bone perimeter were increased (16% and 229%, respectively). The present findings indicate that cancellous bone loss in rat lumbar vertebrae during spaceflight is accompanied by increased bone resorption and MAT but no change in bone formation. These findings do not support the hypothesis that increased MAT during spaceflight reduces osteoblast activity or lifespan. However, in the context of ovarian hormone deficiency, bone formation during spaceflight was insufficient to balance increased resorption, indicating defective coupling. The results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that during spaceflight mesenchymal stem cells are diverted to adipocytes at the expense of forming osteoblasts. This dataset derives results from the bone histomorphometry assay.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "After vehicle return, 13–15 hours was required to perform initial health inspections and to transport the animals from their landing site in the Orenburg region of Russia to the dissection site in Moscow. BSP personnel then sacrificed mice and dissected and flash froze tissues. The authors of this study received isolated frozen tails from the post-flight mice (flight, n equals 6) and vivarium controls (control, n equals 8). The C3-C4 caudal motion segment was isolated from each specimen and thawed. The ventral side of each motion segment was marked with tissue dye to track orientation. Surrounding ligaments and soft tissues were removed to isolate the discs and vertebrae, and X-ray scans were obtained for each specimen to measure disc height as an average of three measurements taken at the center of the disc. Specimens were kept hydrated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) throughout tissue preparation.     Indication of post-flight vertebral rim fractures noted by histology prompted a mCT bone analysis. Adjacent whole motion segments were scanned using high-resolution X-ray microscopy to quantify bone mineral density and trabecular microarchitecture (mCT 50, SCANCO Medical, Bruttisellen, Switzerland). Motion segments were oriented with the longitudinal axis of the spine perpendicular to the radiation beam and scanned in 70% ethanol at a 4mm voxel size using a tube voltage of 55 kVp and an X-ray intensity of 109mA.     Image reconstruction was performed using SCANCO software and scans were analyzed using SCANCO Evaluation Program v6.5-3 to quantify bone volume fraction (BV/TV), bone mineral density (BMD), and trabecular microarchitecture (trabecular number, thickness, and spacing) on each whole motion segment. Subsequently, these same analyses were performed on a trabecular compartment of bone in the metaphysis adjacent to the cranial growth plate of each vertebra to quantify changes in parameters specific to the trabecular bone. This trabecular volume of interest (VOI) was manually delineated using an irregular contour drawn a few pixels away from the endocortical surface. The VOI began just below the growth plate on the cranial end of the vertebra and extended 1mm (250 slices) towards the diaphysis. This VOI was chosen rather than isolated epiphyses because murine epiphyses are very small (\u00020.7–0.8mm3) and composed largely of cortical bone, which remodels slower than trabecular bone. The chosen VOI had a larger trabecular volume which improved our statistical power for identifying bone density changes induced by spaceflight. For all analyses, a lower threshold of 300 grayscale units was used to segregate mineralized tissue from soft tissue and scan medium, and Gaussian filters with a sigma of 0.5 and support of two were applied to remove noise. Morphometric indices were calculated using a 3D model-independent algorithm, and BMD was calculated using a linear attenuation coefficient determined by calibration with a SCANCO hydroxyapatite phantom.     The content for this dataset was extracted from a meta-analysis performed by the authors of Fu et al., 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-021-00147-7). The purpose of the meta-analysis was to mine the literature in order to quantify microgravity-induced changes to bone health in animals. The authors provided to ALSDA a global dataset, based upon 40 different literature-derived articles. In collaboration with the authors and the ALSDA Analysis Working Group (AWG), these datasets were then parsed into individual 'original' files of data. This 'original' data file is made available (so users can see original version). To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a microCT data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all microCT results to be identically structured for efficient data mining. Of note, these values are groups of sample, with 'sample name 1' (group 1) having an N of 3, and 'sample name 2' (group 2) having an N of 5.     This study was approved by the NASA Ames Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Fourteen male C57BL/6 mice (19–20 weeks old) were obtained through NASA’s Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP). Six mice had flown in low Earth orbit on a 30-day microgravity Bion M1 mission and were sacrificed 13–15 h after landing.  Eight control mice were kept on the ground during the same 30-day period in standard vivarium cages (GM 500, Tecniplast, Buguggiate, Italy).",

While bending motions are main contributors to herniation, the effects of microgravity on the bending properties of spinal discs are unknown. Consequently, the goal of this study was to quantify the bending properties of tail discs from mice with or without microgravity exposure. Caudal motion segments from six mice returned from a 30-day Bion M1 mission and eight vivarium controls were loaded to failure in four-point bending. After testing, specimens were processed using histology to determine the location of failure, and adjacent motion segments were scanned with micro-computed tomography (mCT) to quantify bone properties. We observed that spaceflight significantly shortened the nonlinear toe region of the force-displacement curve by 32% and reduced the bending strength by 17%. Flight mouse spinal segments tended to fail within the growth plate and epiphyseal bone, while controls tended to fail at the disc-vertebra junction. Spaceflight significantly reduced vertebral bone volume fraction, bone mineral density, and trabecular thickness, which may explain the tendency of flight specimens to fail within the epiphyseal bone. Together, these results indicate that vertebral bone loss during spaceflight may degrade spine bending properties and contribute to increased disc herniation risk in astronauts. This dataset was derived from the literature, and contains only grouped mCT data from the vertebra.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "In the Rodent Research Reference Mission (RRRM-2), forty female C57BL/6NTac mice were flown on the International Space Station. To assess differences in outcomes due to age, twenty 12 week-old and twenty 29 week-old mice were flown, respectively. To directly assess spaceflight effects, half of the young and old mice (10 old, 10 young) were sacrificed on-orbit after 55-58 days (ISS Terminal, ISS-T), while the other half (10 old, 10 young) were returned live to Earth after 32 days and allowed to recover for 24 days (Live Animal Return, LAR) before sacrifice. ISS-T and LAR mice were the same age at sacrifice. Both the ISS-T and LAR animals had independent ground controls (10 mice per group housed in flight hardware in matched environmental conditions), basal controls (10 mice per group sacrificed 2 days before launch), and vivarium controls (10 mice per group housed within standard vivarium habitats). Thus RRRM-2 included a total of 160 mice. GeneLab only processed up to 5 mice from each of the young/ old group from baseline/ flight/ ground control/ vivarium group in this dataset. All mice (C57BL/6NTac) were sourced from Taconic Biosciences (Germantown, NY). Mice were weighed, chipped with BMDS RFID chip (IMI-500) and shipped to NASA KSC for delivery at approximately L-5 weeks. Mice were housed and maintained in the Animal Care Facility (ACF) at NASA KSC with 12:12 light cycle matched in timing to the light cycle used for Transporters and Habitats programmed for flight. All mice were housed in cages of 5 mice/cage with the same littermates as they had been raised. Mice were initially given ad lib standard lab chow and water, which was changed on a schedule of 2x per week. Mice were housed initially on standard bedding and provided igloo-type enrichment. Animal health was checked daily by appropriately trained NASA personnel and contracted lab technicians. At L-4 weeks, mice were placed on raised mesh flooring to simulate spaceflight Transporter and Habitat cage conditions, given water delivered through lixits identical to those used in the flight hardware and put on the NASA Nutrient-Upgraded Rodent Foodbars (NuRFB). Food and water were changed weekly, and mice were weighed bi-weekly. Igloo-type enrichment was provided in all cages. At L-12 days, mice were grouped (10 mice per cage) in larger cages for social acclimation prior to launch. Groupings were done based on age of animals and in a manner to establish similar average weights between any given grouping. At L-2 days, baseline, spaceflight and ground control groups were identified. At L-1 day, spaceflight animals were loaded into spaceflight Transporters. Habitat Ground Control (HGC) mice were loaded into Transporters on a 3-day offset from spaceflight animals. Vivarium Ground Control (VGC) mice (also on a 3-day offset) were returned to 5 mice/cage and placed on standard bedding and provided water through typical sipper tubes at launch equivalent. All mice were maintained on NuRFB throughout the duration of the study. Spaceflight and HGC mice were given new food at weekly intervals. VGC mice were given new food and fresh water also on weekly intervals. An enrichment Hut, in the form of a grated shelter, was provided in the habitat. After splashdown, flight LAR mice were transferred to the animal care facility at Scripps Research Institute where they were assessed and re-caged into standard caging conditions (5 mice/cage, standard bedding and ad lib water from regular sipper tubes). LAR and ISS-T Ground Control mice were shipped from Kennedy Space Center to Scripps and housed under the same conditions as the flight mice. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)     Live Animal Return (LAR): Mice were anesthetized with gas anesthesia and euthanized by means of cardiac puncture blood draw (exsanguination) and double thoracotomy. Heart tissues were removed and microdissected. The coronary artery was isolated and excess pulmonary vein and aorta was removed. The atria were removed, followed by the right ventricle. Right ventricle tissues (and all other heart and vascular tissues) were LN2 frozen within 20-30 minutes of the thoracotomy procedure. The left ventricle was split into the top and bottom portion, and included the septum. All groups (flight, habitat and vivarium ground controls) were treated identically. Tissues were maintained at -80C or lower temperatures throughout the storage during transportation and shipment.\n\nISS Terminal (ISS-T) samples: Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and euthanized by means of cardiac puncture blood draw (exsanguination) and double thoracotomy. The liver, right eye, heart, spleen, left lateral liver lobe, right kidney/adrenal gland, spleen and right hindlimb (hip to foot, skin removed) were dissected fresh from each carcass and placed in tubes or sample bags containing a minimum of 5:1 volume of RNA Later to tissue.  Heart tissues collected on-orbit (Flight group) were allowed to equilibrate for 48 hours at 4C and then frozen in MELFI to less than -80C for long-term storage. For all other heart tissues collected on the ground (baseline, habitat ground control and vivarium ground control groups), the time at 4C is unknown (see Sample Preservation Method column). These tissues were allowed to equilibrate for 48 hours at 4C and then frozen in MELFI to less than -80C for long-term storage. The right brain hemisphere was dissected and placed directly in a cryotube and rapidly frozen using the ISS rapid freeze system.  Each carcass was then wrapped in foil and frozen in MELFI on board the ISS or in ground -80C freezers. Carcasses were maintained at -80C or lower temperatures throughout the storage on board the ISS, in ground freezers and during transportation and shipment. For additional tissue dissection, carcasses were thawed at room temperature one at a time (staggered) until the tissues were sufficiently pliable for dissection (approximately 60-90 minutes). Once thawed, the tissues were removed from each carcass, weighed, as appropriate, placed in labelled tubes and snap frozen on liquid nitrogen. Tissues were maintained at -80C or lower temperatures throughout the storage in ground freezers and during transportation and shipment.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://www.nasa.gov/reference/osdr-environmental-data/.     RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Universal Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Entirety of available tissue was cut into small strips of approximately 2mm by 5mm and immediately placed in 600 µL of the Buffer RLT solution (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) with 1% beta mercaptoethanol. Homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix SSB (Next Advance, Raymertown, NY) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance, Raymertown, NY) for 5 minutes at 4 ˚C, speed of 12, per SOP 2.1-Tissue homogenization Using Bullet Blender Gold Bead Beater. Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 minutes at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. For each sample, an lysate volume equivalent of 15 mg of tissue was transferred into a clean tube and four volumes of QIAzol reagent were added into the tube. Resulting lysate solution was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 µL RNAse free H2O. Concentration for all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR kit following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).

GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA ribo depletion and library preparation was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) following GeneLab SOP 5.1 Ilumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Lirary Prep using epMotion. Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN greater than 4. Index adapters used were at 1.5 µM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit. Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scentific, Waltham, MA) following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as following: Read 1:151bp, Index1: 17bp, Index2: 8bp Read 2: 151bp. PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     UMIs were extracted from fastq files using UMI-tools (version 1.1.2). Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.3 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.3/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. The data were normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor*. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis.html report.\n\n*ERCC-normalized data are available upon request.",

To assess differences in outcomes due to age, twenty 12 week-old and twenty 29 week-old mice were flown, respectively. To directly assess spaceflight effects, half of the young and old mice (10 old, 10 young) were sacrificed on-orbit after 55-58 days (ISS Terminal, ISS-T), while the other half (10 old, 10 young) were returned live to Earth after 32 days and allowed to recover for 24 days (Live Animal Return, LAR) before sacrifice. ISS-T and LAR mice were the same age at sacrifice. Both the ISS-T and LAR animals had independent ground controls (GC; 10 mice per group housed in flight hardware in matched environmental conditions), basal controls (BSL; 10 mice per group sacrificed 2 days before launch), and vivarium controls (VIV; 10 mice per group housed within standard vivarium habitats). Thus RRRM-2 included a total of 160 mice. This study includes bulk RNA sequencing ribodepleted gene expression data from hearts from 5 old and 5 young animals from each of the following groups: LAR basal, LAR ground control, LAR vivarium control, LAR flight, ISS-T basal, ISS-T ground control, and ISS-T flight. The ISS-T vivarium control young group has only 3 animals due to quality control issues.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "The RR-1 mice were euthanized by ISS crew with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation, frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C) and brought back to Earth. Exact matched procedures were held for ground control, vivarium, and basal groups. After vehicle return, dissection of all four groups (flight, baseline, ground, vivarium) were conducted. The returned carcasses were thawed and dissected twice. The first round of carcass dissections, known as the RR1 1st thaw BSP (Biospecimen Sharing Program), spanned a 2-week period in April 2015 and a 1-week period in May 2015. The RR1 2nd thaw BSP was performed in March 2016. BSP samples were dissected, frozen, and then transferred to the Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA; now NBISC [NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection) for long-term storage. Tissues from forty mice were received for this study, from RR-1 through BSP/ALSDA and lumbar vertebrae (L4) were assessed for cancellous bone by microcomputed tomography. Vertebrae were preserved by wrapping specimens with single 2-ply gauze squares (1/3 of a typical tri-fold gauze pad) and dipped into PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+. Tissues were stored in labeled specimen containers and placed on ice, and subsequently stored at -20C.     The mCT machine used for this study was a SkyScan 1174, Bruker, Belgium. The scanning was conducted at 6.7 micrometers per pixel, x-ray intensity was 800 miliamperes, and killivolt peak was 50kvp, with frame averaging of 2. A .log file from the scanning, reconstruction, and analysis from this mCT study was submitted and available for data provenance.     This study was approved by by the NASA Ames Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Post-pubescent female C57BL/6J mice (16 weeks at launch) were exposed to 37 days of microG flight, after being flown to the ISS, and housed in the Rodent Habitat. Mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. The mice were acclimated to NASA Rodent Food bars, lixits, and wire floors.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a microCT data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all microCT results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.     An upper/lower threshold approach was used to binarize grayscale images, with a lower gray threshold of 40 and upper gray threshold of 255 (on 0-1000 scale).     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Before launch and again before the post-flight euthanization, a handheld tonometer (TonoLab-ICARE, Raleigh, NC) was used to measure IOP in conscious animals. This allowed IOP to be measured accurately, rapidly and without a local anesthetic. Measurements of IOP using the rebound tonometer appeared to be well tolerated by the mice. The animals exhibited no signs of irritation or discomfort during the procedure. Five-6 sequential measurements were made to obtain an average of the counts as a single IOP readout for each mouse. This process was repeated three times for each eye.     On August 14, 2017, SpaceX successfully launched the 12th Commercial Resupply Service (CRS-12) payload at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) which included 10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (n equals 20) (Jackson laboratories, Inc. Bar harbor, ME) for NASA’s ninth Rodent Research experiment (RR-9). The mice lived in NASA’s Rodent Habitats (RH) aboard ISS for 35 days before returning to Earth via SpaceX’s Dragon capsule. All mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26–28 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle during the flight. GC mice were placed into the same housing hardware used in flight, and environmental parameters such as temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels were kept equivalent to that of FLT mice based on 48 h delayed telemetry data. GC mice were fed the same reformulated rodent food bar diet approved by NASA as the space flown mice. Consumption of food and water was monitored daily throughout this study. Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Loma Linda University (LLU) and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and activities involving vertebrate animals are carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Due to Hurricane Irma’s impact on KSC in September, 2017, experiments with both GC and GV control groups were cancelled and later rescheduled for May, 2018, using mice of the same strain, sex, age and animals were from the same holding room from the vendor that were used for the flight experiments. This resulted in a large time gap between tissue collection for the flight and KSC ground control groups. Consequently, the FV cohort-matched control group was added to the study to help control for possible differences associated with this delay. Tissue collection with the FV group were conducted several days after studies with the FLT animals were concluded.     Post-flight evaluation of the mice. Upon return to the Earth, mice were transported to LLU within 28 hours of splashdown. At LLU, animals were removed from the animal enclosure hardware and assessed for survival and health. The inspecting personnel reported that all the mice survived the 35-day space mission and were in good condition, i.e. no obvious deficiencies/abnormalities. Within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a intraocular pressure data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures).

          "Study Description": "The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and remeasured before the mice were euthanized after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4–19.3 mmHg vs 16.3–20.3 mmHg) (p less than 0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups (p less than 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight.

          "Study Protocol Description": "Soleus and TA muscle samples were obtained after a request through the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection. We were specifically provided with soleus and TA samples from male C57BL/6J mice from the RR9 mission (n equals 10 per group) and soleus samples from female C57BL/6J mice from the RR1 mission (n equals 4 per group). The male mice from the RR9 mission were 10 weeks of age at launch, and the female mice from the RR1 mission were 16 weeks of age. All mice originated from Jackson Laboratories. Mice in the flight group and ground control group were housed in NASA’s Rodent Flight Hardware and were provided ad libitum access to food (NASA Type 12 Nutrient upgraded rodent food bars) and water. The rodent habitat was modified from heritage flight hardware to provide long-term housing for rodents aboard the ISS and was programmed on a 12:12 h light/dark cycle with enough food and water being provided so that replenishment was not required for the mission. Temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide levels were matched for flight and ground control groups. Mice in the VIV group were housed in standard laboratory cages. In addition to the flight, GC, and VIV groups, we also received two cohort control groups from the RR9 mission. Due to Hurricane Irma (September 2017), the original RR9 GC and VIV experiments were prematurely terminated. The GC and VIV experiments were then repeated in May 2018 using the same strain of mice that were used for the flight experiment. Along with the new GC and VIV groups, an additional set of mice were used as cohort controls to normalize the variation due to differences in cohorts. That is, the mice originally dedicated to serve as the VIV group in 2017 were labeled as cohort 1, and another set of similarly matched (both in age, sex, and treatment) mice were run as cohort 2 in 2018. Importantly, we found no differences in Ca2+ uptake in either the soleus or TA muscles from cohort control 1 (CC1) and cohort control 2 (CC2), and therefore did not need to normalize to any variation due to cohorts.     For RR9, we received TA muscles that were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C, and soleus muscles that were stored in RNALater (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at −80 °C. For RR1, we received soleus muscles that were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. For all samples, we homogenized the muscles in homogenizing buffer (250 mM Sucrose, 5 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.2% NaN3 (pH 7.5)) prior to storing them at −80 °C.     Rates of Ca2+ uptake in the muscle homogenates were measured using the Indo-1 Ca2+ fluorophore as previously described, but fitted onto a 96-well plate. Briefly, muscle homogenate was added to reaction buffer (200 mM KCl, 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM NaN3, 5 μM TPEN, 15 mM MgCl2 (pH 7.0)) containing Indo-1 (4 μM final concentration; 57180, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).     Samples were then plated in duplicate, to which ATP (10 mM final concentration) was added to initiate Ca2+ uptake.     The ratio of Ca2+-bound to Ca2+-free Indo-1 (405/485 nm emission) was measured using a Molecular Devices M2 plate reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) upon excitation at 355 nm at 37 °C. The amount of Ca2+ uptake was then calculated as the change in the ratio of Ca2+-bound to Ca2+-free Indo-1 and measuring the area under the curve, with the smaller the area under the curve being indicative of more Ca2+ uptake over time.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.     To assess SERCA2a, SERCA1a, PLN, SLN, and NNAT protein content as well as the amount of post-translational modifications—nitrotyrosine and nitrocysteine—present in the soleus, we used Western blotting. Using a BCA assay to assess protein concentration, we utilized a total protein load of 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, and 15 mg for the aforementioned proteins, respectively, and 20 mg for nitrotyrosine and nitrocysteine in the soleus muscle. For the TA, 10 mg of protein was loaded for SERCA2a and 2.5 mg for SERCA1a with 20 mg similarly loaded for post-translational modifications. To investigate the MHC protein content, we loaded 8 mg of protein.     Muscle homogenates were solubilized in Laemmli buffer ( 161-0747, BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) before being separated by SDS-PAGE using TGX BioRad PreCast 4–15% gradient gels ( 4568086, BioRad) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane using the BioRad Transblot Turbo for all except for SLN, which was separated using tricine-based SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a wet-transfer.     All membranes were blocked using Everyblot ( 12010020, BioRad) for 5 min at room temperature before the addition of primary antibodies.     Antibodies for SERCA2a, SERCA1a, PLN, NNAT, SLN, Nitrotyrosine, Nitrocysteine were labeled for soleus muscle. Antibodies for SERCA2a, SERCA1a, Nitrotyrosine, Nitrocysteine, MHCIIa, MHCIIx, MHCIIb were labeled for tibialis anterior muscle. SERCA1a (Ma3-911), SERCA2a (MA3-919), and PLN (MA3-922) antibodies were obtained from ThermoFisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). SLN antibodies were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (ABT13) and NNAT from Proteintech (26905-1-AP, Rosemont, IL, USA). Nitrotyrosine was purchased from Cayman Chemical (189542, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), and nitrocysteine was obtained from Abcam (ab94930, Cambridge, UK). Finally, the antibodies for MHC IIa (SC-71), MHC IIx (6H1), and MHC IIb (10F5) were purchased from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa City, IA, USA). All primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed 3× in Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST). Corresponding anti-mouse (SERCA2a, SERCA1a, PLN, nitrotyrosine, nitrocysteine) or anti-rabbit (SLN, NNAT) secondary antibodies diluted in 5% (w/v) milk in TBST were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, followed by 3 washes in TBST.     Membranes were imaged using Immobilon® ECL Ultra Western HRP Substrate (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA) and a BioRad ChemiDoc Imager.     Ponceau stains were used to quantify total protein loads, and all images were analyzed using ImageLab software (BioRad).",

          "Study Description": "It is well established that microgravity exposure causes significant muscle weakness and atrophy via muscle unloading. On Earth, muscle unloading leads to a disproportionate loss in muscle force and size with the loss in muscle force occurring at a faster rate. Although the exact mechanisms are unknown, a role for Ca2+ dysregulation has been suggested. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump actively brings cytosolic Ca2+ into the SR, eliciting muscle relaxation and maintaining low intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). SERCA dysfunction contributes to elevations in [Ca2+]i, leading to cellular damage, and may contribute to the muscle weakness and atrophy observed with spaceflight. Here, we investigated SERCA function, SERCA regulatory protein content, and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS) protein adduction in murine skeletal muscle after 35-37 days of spaceflight. In male and female soleus muscles, spaceflight led to drastic impairments in Ca2+ uptake despite significant increases in SERCA1a protein content. We attribute this impairment to an increase in RONS production and elevated total protein tyrosine (T) nitration and cysteine (S) nitrosylation. Contrarily, in the tibialis anterior (TA), we observed an enhancement in Ca2+ uptake, which we attribute to a shift towards a faster muscle fiber type (i.e., increased myosin heavy chain IIb and SERCA1a) without elevated total protein T-nitration and S-nitrosylation. Thus, spaceflight affects SERCA function differently between the soleus and TA. This dataset derives results from the calcium uptake (spectrofluorometry) and Western blot assays.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Twenty (20) mice (male, C57BL/6J, 16-17 weeks old) were launched in one Transporter on SpaceX-21 (SpX-21) on December 6, 2020. The Flight mice were transferred into two Rodent Habitats upon arrival to the International Space Station (ISS) and were maintained in microgravity for 38 days. The Flight mice were transferred into a Transporter and returned to Earth for Live Animal Return (LAR) on SpX-21 (January 13th, 2021). After Atlantic Ocean splashdown, the LAR Flight mice were transported via helicopter to Kennedy Space Center. Collectively, 20 Flight, 20 HGC, and 20 VGC mice were transferred from Rodent Transporters (Flight and HGC) or vivarium cages (VGC) and placed into shipping containers. All 60 mice were flown via charter plane to the PI's institution, Texas A and M University (TAMU). The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol (Protocol number RR-23) was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     All post-flight euthanasia and dissections were performed by the PI team at TAMU. The original plan was to perform all pre-flight and post-flight activities at Roskamp Institute in Sarasota, Florida. Due to the health risks associated with travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, HRP approved all post-flight activities at TAMU, which significantly decreased or eliminated travel for the PI, BSP, and Payload Developer (PD) teams. Upon arrival at the TAMU Animal Care Facility (ACF), the mice underwent post-flight procedures, followed by euthanasia and tissue collection by the PI team.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://www.nasa.gov/reference/osdr-environmental-data/.     RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Universal Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Approximately 25 mg of tissue was used, weighed, and immediately placed in 850 µL of the QIAzol buffer solution. Homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix SSB14B, a mix of stainless steel beads of 0.9-2.0mm (Next Advance, Raymertown, NY) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance, Raymertown, NY) for 5 minutes at 4 ˚C, speed of 12 per SOP 2.1-Tissue homogenization Using Bullet Blender Gold Bead Beater. Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 minutes at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 30 µL RNAse free H2O. Concentration for all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR kit following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).

GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA ribo depletion and library preparation was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) following GeneLab SOP 5.1 Ilumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Lirary Prep using epMotion. Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN greater than 4. Index adapters used were at 1.5 µM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit. Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scentific, Waltham, MA) following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as following: Read 1: 151bp, Index1: 17bp, Index2:8bp Read 2:151bp. PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     UMIs were extracted from fastq files using UMI-tools (version 1.1.2). Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.2 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.2/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0), ERCC genes were removed, and the non-ERCC genes were normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis_GLbulkRNAseq.html report.",

To this end, twenty male, C57BL/6J, 16-17 weeks-old mice were delivered to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX-21 in a single transporter, transferred to two rodent habitats, and maintained in microgravity for 38 days. Flight mice were then returned to Earth alive (January 13th, 2021). After splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean, mice were transported to Kennedy Space Center via helicopter. The 20 Flight, 20 Habitat Ground Control (HGC), and 20 Vivarium Ground Control (VGC) mice were removed from Rodent Transporters (Flight and HGC) or vivarium cages (VGC), placed into shipping containers, and flown to Texas A and M University. There, mice underwent post-flight procedures, before euthanasia and tissue collection. Flight, HGC and VGC animals were euthanized and dissected on Jan 14th, 17th or 20th of 2021, respectively. Right tibialis anterior muscle samples were preserved by immersion in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C until RNA was extracted, and libraries generated and sequenced (target 60 M clusters per sample, PE 150 bp). This dataset features 9 samples from the Flight group, 9 samples from the HGC group, and 9 samples from the VGC group.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "The baseline group was sacrificed on day of launch. Flight animals were sacrificed 4-6 hours after landing. Additional ground-based ovary-intact rats (n equals 18) were evaluated. The ovary-intact animals represent reserve rats to be used if the originally planned flight had been delayed. Since the mission was carried out as anticipated, these animals were maintained in a vivarium and sacrificed to provide age-matched reference values for baseline (n equals 8, 12 weeks old) and flight (n equals 10, 14 weeks old). The purpose of the ovary-intact controls was 2-fold: 1) to evaluate normal age-related changes in bone over the 2 week flight period, and 2) to verify that ovariectomies (OVX) resulted in anticipated cancellous osteopenia. This dataset is only the data from OVX animals. All rats were sacrificed by decapitation and bones were harvested and placed in 70% ethanol for analysis.     Micro-computed Tomography was used for nondestructive three-dimensional evaluation of bone volume and cortical and cancellous bone microarchitecture. Femora, humeri, 2nd lumbar vertebrae, and right calvaria were scanned using a Scanco mCT40 scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland) at 55 kVp x-ray\nvoltage, 145 milliampere intensity, and 200 ms integration time. Femora, humeri, and right calvaria were scanned at a voxel size of 12micron × 12 micron × 12 micron while 2nd lumbar vertebrae were scanned at a voxel size of 16 micron × 16 micron × 16 micron. Cortical bone was evaluated in the femur and humerus diaphyses. Cancellous bone was evaluated in the distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis, in the distal humerus epiphysis, and in the vertebral body. Calvarial thickness was evaluated in a subsection of the parietal bone.\n\n\nFemur. Eighty-two slices (984 micrometers in length) of cortical bone were assessed in the femur mid-diaphysis. All cortical slices were examined visually for evidence of cancellous struts originating from the endocortex (extremely rare at this site) and manually removed when present. Direct cortical bone measurements included total cross-sectional volume (mm3), cortical volume (mm3), marrow volume (mm3) and cortical thickness (micrometers). Three-dimensional cortical volume measurements\nwere converted to two-dimensional area measurements. Polar moment of inertia (mm4) was determined as a surrogate measure of bone strength in torsion. Seventy four slices (888 micrometers in length) of cancellous bone, 150 slices (1,800 micrometers in length) proximal to the growth plate, were assessed in the distal femur metaphysis. The entire cancellous bone compartment (64 plus-minus 1 slices, 768 plus-minus 12micrometers) was evaluated in the distal femur epiphysis. Direct\ncancellous bone measurements included bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume; volume of total tissue occupied by cancellous bone, percent), connectivity density (number of redundant connections per unit volume, mm-3; this index detects defects in cancellous architecture), structure model index (an architectural index defining bone as plate-like or rod-like with values ranging from 0 to 3, respectively), trabecular thickness (mean thickness of individual trabeculae, micrometers), trabecular number (number of trabecular intercepts per unit length, mm-1) and trabecular separation (distance between trabeculae, micrometers).\n\n\nHumerus. Twenty slices (240 micrometers in length) of cortical bone were evaluated in the humerus diaphysis. The entire cancellous compartment (65 plus-minus 1 slices, 780 plus-minus 12 micrometers in length) was evaluated in the distal humerus epiphysis. Cortical and cancellous bone measurements were the same as those described for the femur.\n\n\nLumbar vertebra. Analysis of the lumbar vertebra included the entire region of cancellous bone in the vertebral body between the cranial and caudal growth plates (238 plus-minus 2 slices, 3808 plus-minus 32 micrometers in length). Cancellous bone measurements were the same as those described for the distal femur.\n\n\nCalvarium. Calvarial thickness (micrometers) was measured in the parietal bone in a 1.2 × 2.4 mm rectangle starting 1.8 mm rostral to the lambdoid suture, and midway between the sagittal suture and temporal crest.     Automated contouring was used to delineate cortical bone from non-bone. Filtering parameters sigma and support were set to 0.8 and 1, respectively. The threshold value for evaluation was determined empirically and set at 245 (gray scale, 0-1000).     Twelve-week-old female Fischer 344 rats (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) were used in the study. The animals were maintained in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the experimental protocol was approved by the NASA and Mayo Clinic Animal Care and Use Committees. The rats were ovx 14 days prior to launch and randomly assigned to one of three treatment\ngroups: 1) baseline control (baseline, n equals 6), 2) ground-based flight control (ground control, n equals 12), or 3) spaceflight (flight, n equals 12). The flight animals were flown on the Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-62) for 14 days. Flight and ground control animals were housed in animal enclosure modules (AEM) with 6 rats/AEM. The AEMs were maintained at 28 °C. All animals were provided with food\n(Teklad L356 food bars; Teklad Inc., Madison, WI) and water ad libitum.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a microCT data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all microCT results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.",

          "Study Description": "This study investigated the effects of a 14-day spaceflight on bone mass, density and microarchitecture in weight bearing (femur and humerus) and non-weight bearing (2nd) lumbar vertebra and calvarium) bones in the context of ovarian hormone insufficiency. 12-week-old Fisher 344 rats were ovariectomized 2 weeks before flight and randomized into one of three groups: 1) baseline (n equals 6), 2) ground control (n equals 12) or 3) spaceflight (n equals 12). Additional ground-based ovary-intact rats provided age-matched reference values at baseline (n equals 8) and landing (n equals 10). Ovariectomy resulted in bone- and bone compartment-specific deficits in cancellous bone volume fraction. Spaceflight resulted in lower cortical bone accrual in the femur but had no effect on cortical bone in the humerus or calvarium. Cancellous bone volume fraction was lower in flight animals compared to ground control animals in lumbar vertebra and distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis; significant differences were not detected in the distal humerus. Bone loss (compared to baseline controls) in the femur metaphysis was associated with lower trabecular number, whereas trabecular thickness and number were lower in the epiphysis. This dataset is only for the ovariectomized animals. In summary, the effect of spaceflight on bone microarchitecture in ovariectomized rats was bone-and bone compartment-specific but not strictly related to weight bearing. This dataset derives results from the micro–computed tomography (mCT) assay.",

Cerebellum and hippocampus were split from the right brain hemisphere, embedded in OCT compound, cryosectioned and placed on Visium Gene Expression arrays.     Sample preparations were performed at by SciLifeLab following 10X Genomics Visium protocol (https://www.10xgenomics.com/spatial-transcriptomics). On the Visium Gene Expression array, the tissue is fixed, stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin and imaged. Imaging step is followed by tissue permeabilization in order to release mRNA from each section. The mRNA molecules are captured by barcoded probes in their spatial location of the array surface. Subsequently, synthesis of cDNA is performed.     Sequencing library constructions were performed by SciLifeLab following 10X Genomics Visium protocol. (https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression) and sent to NASA GeneLab for sequencing,     Sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Paired end: read 1 at 28 bp and read 2 at 90 bp. PhiX included as control at 1%. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs. After initial assessment, a different serial section from the following sample was re-imaged and sequenced by SciLifeLab with Paired end: read 1 at 28 bp and read 2 at 150 bp: RR10_Cb_FLT_WT_F3.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on May-2024. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.17) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Twenty (20) mice (female, 10 B6129SF2/J Wild Type (WT) and 10 B6;129S2-Cdkn1atm1Tyj/J (p21-null), 14-15 weeks old) were launched in one Transporter on SpaceX-21 (SpX-21) on December 6, 2020. The Flight (FL) mice were transferred into two Rodent Habitats upon arrival to the International Space Station (ISS) and were maintained in microgravity for 28-29 days. At 7 days before euthanasia (December 26 and 27, 2020), all 20 mice received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection with the bone formation marker (Calcein). At about 48 +/- 2 hours before euthanasia (December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2021), all 20 mice received an IP injection with a second dose of Calcein as well as the cell proliferation marker (BrdU). At approximately 28-29 days in microgravity (January 2 and 3, 2021), the Flight mice were euthanized with a Ketamine/Xylazine cocktail, followed by cardiac puncture and thoracotomy. Following skin removal, both hindlimb quarters were removed and preserved or fixed. Each carcass was wrapped in aluminum foil, preserved in the CryoChiller, and stored at -80C or colder until return to PI. Two other groups of mice, 20 for Ground Control (GC) and 24 for Vivarium Control (VIV), half B6129SF/J Wild Type (WT) and half B6;129S2-Cdkn1atm1Tyj/J (p21-null), were selected by the PI and underwent the same procedures and treatment as the Flight group but with an offset of 3 days. In addition to the IP injections (Calcein and BrdU) described above, all mice in the FL, GC, and VIV groups also received a pre-flight subcutaneous injection of the bone marker (Alizarin Red). Twenty (20) female mice (half WT and half p21-null) were selected by the PI for the Baseline Control (BL) group. Following a successful Launch, baseline animals were injected with Calcein at the time of Launch (7 days prior to dissection) and at 48 +/- 2 hours before dissection. BL animals were also injected with BrdU at 48 +/- 2 hours before dissection. Baseline dissections were performed 7 days after launch following the same procedures used for the Flight animals. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     At the end of RR-10 experiment, all frozen carcasses and preserved hindlimbs were returned to the PI. In May 2021, the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) team performed complex and integrated dissections at NASA Ames Research Center with the Principal Investigator team. Right hemispheres were partially embedded in Optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT compound) to maintain the orientation and placed on dry ice until frozen throughout, then stored in -80 C freezer for sample processing. The remaining right hemispheres were snap frozen on liquid nitrogen and stored in -80 C freezer. GeneLab only processed the samples from Wild Type animals of spaceflight and ground control groups in this dataset. Five each of the right brain hemispheres from spaceflight and ground control groups were shipped on dry ice to SciLifeLab Stockholm, KTH Royal Institute of Technology for processing.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample--ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was 'living', including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://www.nasa.gov/reference/osdr-environmental-data/.     RNA was extracted from mouse brain tissue using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mouse brains were cryosectioned at a thickness of 10 uM, and 15 to 30 sections from each brain were collected for RNA extraction. For homogenization, the cryosections were placed in 2 mL Lysing Matrix D tubes (MP Biomedicals) and disrupted using the FastPrep (MP Biomedicals) set at 6.0 m/s for 40 seconds. During disruption, the samples were mixed with 350 uL of a solution prepared by adding 10 uL of β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) to 1 mL of Buffer RLT Plus (Qiagen). After homogenization, the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature to remove cell debris. The supernatant was transferred to a gDNA Eliminator spin column and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 seconds to eliminate genomic DNA. The flow-through containing RNA and proteins was collected and combined with 250 uL of 96-100% ethanol. The resulting mixture was processed according to the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit protocol. RNA was eluted in 20 uL of RNase-free water. RNA quality and concentration were assessed using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and a Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), respectively. Samples with a RNA Integrity Number (RIN) greater than 8 and a concentration exceeding 10 ng/uL were retained. Extracted RNA was stored at -80°C, while aliquots intended for Bioanalyzer analysis were kept at -20°C.

GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA ribo depletion and library preparation was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) following GeneLab SOP 5.1 Ilumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep using epMotion. Input RNA were approximately 500nG with RIN greater than 4. Index adapters used were at 1.5uM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit. Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scentific, Waltham, MA) following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as following: Read 1: 151 bp, Index1: 17 bp, Index2: 8 bp Read 2: 151 bp. PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) were incorporated into the read headers of raw fastq files using UMI-tools version 1.1.2. Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on May-2024. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Samples with total read pairs exceeding 150 million were downsampled to 150 million read pairs with seqtk (version 1.4-r122).     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.1 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.1/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0), ERCC genes were removed, and the non-ERCC genes were normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis_GLbulkRNAseq.html report.",

          "Study Description": "The objective of the Rodent Research-10 mission (RR-10) was to investigate how spaceflight affects the cellular and molecular mechanisms of normal bone tissue regeneration in space. To this end, ten (10) 14-15 weeks-old female B6129SF2/J Wild Type (WT), and ten (10) 14-15 weeks-old female B6;129S2-Cdkn1atm1Tyj/J (p21-null) mice received a pre-flight subcutaneous injection of the bone marker (Alizarin Red), and were then delivered to the ISS aboard SpaceX-21. At 7 days before euthanasia, all 20 mice received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection with a bone formation marker (Calcein). At 48 +/- 2 hours before euthanasia, all 20 mice received an IP injection with a second dose of Calcein as well as a cell proliferation marker (BrdU). Then, following 28-29 days in microgravity, the Flight mice were euthanized. Following removal of hindlimbs, carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, preserved in the CryoChiller, and stored at -80 C or colder until return to Earth. In addition to the Flight group, three ground control groups were also part of the study: Basal (representing the pre-launch state), Vivarium (standard vivarium housing for the same duration of time as flight), and Ground (flight habitat in the International Space Station Environment Simulator, ISSES). Twenty mice (10 of each strain) were included in each of these control groups (except Vivarium which included 12 of each strain). These were treated, euthanized and processed on the same schedule and in the same manner as the flight samples. This study includes bulk RNA sequencing and spatially resolved transcriptional profiling data from cerebellums from 5 WT flight animals, and 5 WT ground control animals. Cerebellums from the right hemisphere were embedded and cryosectioned. Cryosections were either processed for bulk RNA sequencing or placed on gene expression arrays, stained and imaged. Imaging was followed by tissue permeabilization to release mRNA molecules from cells for capture onto the array surface. Subsequently, spatial transcriptomics libraries were prepared and sequenced.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Cryosectioning were performed at by SciLifeLab following 10X Genomics Visium protocol. https://www.10xgenomics.com/spatial-transcriptomics/ Visium is a commercially available kit produced by 10x Genomics, which allows to spatially visualize the gene expression of tissue sections. Cerebellum and hippocampus were split from the right brain hemisphere, embedded in OCT compound, cryosectioned and placed on Visium Gene Expression arrays.     Sample preparations were performed at by SciLifeLab following 10X Genomics Visium protocol (https://www.10xgenomics.com/spatial-transcriptomics). On the Visium Gene Expression array, the tissue is fixed, stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin and imaged. Imaging step is followed by tissue permeabilization in order to release mRNA from each section. The mRNA molecules are captured by barcoded probes in their spatial location of the array surface. Subsequently, synthesis of cDNA is performed.     Sequencing library constructions were performed by SciLifeLab following 10X Genomics Visium protocol. (https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression) and sent to NASA GeneLab for sequencing.     Sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Paired end: read 1 at 28 bp and read 2 at 90 bp. PhiX included as control at 1%. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs. After initial assessment, a different serial section from the following 4 samples was re-imaged and sequenced by SciLifeLab with Paired end: read 1 at 28 bp and read 2 at 150 bp: RRRM2_Cb_FLT_ISS-T_OLD_FO18, RRRM2_Cb_FLT_LAR_OLD_FO5, RRRM2_Cb_FLT_LAR_YNG_FY6, and RRRM2_Cb_GC_ISS-T_YNG_GY10.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on May-2024. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     In the Rodent Research Reference Mission (RRRM-2), forty female C57BL/6NTac mice were flown on the International Space Station. To assess differences in outcomes due to age, twenty 12 week-old and twenty 29 week-old mice were flown, respectively. To directly assess spaceflight effects, half of the young and old mice (10 old, 10 young) were sacrificed on-orbit after 55-58 days (ISS Terminal, ISS-T), while the other half (10 old, 10 young) were returned live to Earth after 32 days and allowed to recover for 24 days (Live Animal Return, LAR) before sacrifice. ISS-T and LAR mice were the same age at sacrifice. Both the ISS-T and LAR animals had independent ground controls (10 mice per group housed in flight hardware in matched environmental conditions), basal controls (10 mice per group sacrificed 2 days before launch), and vivarium controls (10 mice per group housed within standard vivarium habitats). Thus RRRM-2 included a total of 160 mice. GeneLab only processed up to 5 mice from each of the young/old group from flight/ground control groups in this dataset. All mice (C57BL/6NTac) were sourced from Taconic Biosciences (Germantown, NY). Mice were weighed, chipped with BMDS RFID chip (IMI-500) and shipped to NASA KSC for delivery at approximately L-5 weeks. Mice were housed and maintained in the Animal Care Facility (ACF) at NASA KSC with 12:12 light cycle matched in timing to the light cycle used for Transporters and Habitats programmed for flight. All mice were housed in cages of 5 mice/cage with the same littermates as they had been raised. Mice were initially given ad lib standard lab chow and water, which was changed on a schedule of 2x per week. Mice were housed initially on standard bedding and provided with igloo as enrichment material. Animal health was checked daily by appropriately trained NASA personnel and contracted lab technicians. At L-4 weeks, mice were placed on raised mesh flooring to simulate spaceflight Transporter and Habitat cage conditions, given water delivered through lixits identical to those used in the flight hardware and put on the NASA Nutrient-Upgraded Rodent Foodbars (NuRFB). Food and water were changed weekly, and mice were weighed bi-weekly. Igloo was provided as enrichment material in all cages. At L-12 days, mice were grouped (10 mice per cage) in larger cages for social acclimation prior to launch. Groupings were done based on age of animals and in a manner to establish similar average weights between any given grouping. At L-2 days, baseline, spaceflight and ground control groups were identified. At L-1 day, spaceflight animals were loaded into spaceflight Transporters. Habitat Ground Control (HGC) mice were loaded into Transporters on a 3-day offset from spaceflight animals. Vivarium Ground Control (VGC) mice (also on a 3-day offset) were returned to 5 mice/cage and placed on standard bedding and provided water through typical sipper tubes at launch equivalent. All mice were maintained on NuRFB throughout the duration of the study. Spaceflight and HGC mice were given new food at weekly intervals. VGC mice were given new food and fresh water also on weekly intervals. An enrichment Hut, in the form of a grated shelter, was provided in the habitat for the flight and habitat ground control group. Igloo was provided in the vivarium ground control group. After splashdown, flight LAR mice were transferred to the animal care facility at Scripps Research Institute where they were assessed and re-caged into standard caging conditions (5 mice/cage, standard bedding and ad lib water from regular sipper tubes). LAR and ISS-T Ground Control mice were shipped from Kennedy Space Center to Scripps and housed under the same conditions as the flight mice. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     For ISS terminal (ISS-T) group, mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and euthanized by means of cardiac puncture blood draw (exsanguination) and double thoracotomy. A list of tissues including right brain hemisphere were dissected fresh from each carcass. The right brain hemisphere was dissected and placed directly in a cryotube and rapidly frozen using the ISS rapid freeze system. For Live Animal Return (LAR) group, mice were anesthetized with gas anesthesia and euthanized by means of cardiac puncture blood draw (exsanguination) and double thoracotomy. Right hemispheres were partially embedded in Optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT compound) to maintain the orientation and placed on dry ice until frozen throughout, then stored in -80 C freezer for sample processing. The remaining right hemispheres were snap frozen on liquid nitrogen and stored in -80 C freezer. All groups (baseline, flight, habitat and vivarium ground controls) were treated identically. Selected flight and habitat ground control groups of both LAR OCT-embedded right brain hemispheres and ISS-T frozen right brain hemispheres were shipped on dry ice to SciLifeLab Stockholm, KTH Royal Institute of Technology for processing to generate the data in this study.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample--ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was 'living', including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://www.nasa.gov/reference/osdr-environmental-data/.     RNA was extracted from mouse right brain tissue using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mouse brains were cryosectioned at a thickness of 10 µm, and 15 to 30 sections from each brain were collected for RNA extraction. For homogenization, the cryosections were placed in 2 mL Lysing Matrix D tubes (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) and disrupted using the FastPrep (MP Biomedicals) set at 6.0 m/s for 40 seconds. During disruption, the samples were mixed with 350 µL of a solution prepared by adding 10 µL of β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) to 1 mL of Buffer RLT Plus (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After homogenization, the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature to remove cell debris. The supernatant was transferred to a gDNA Eliminator spin column and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 seconds to eliminate genomic DNA. The flow-through containing RNA and proteins was collected and combined with 250 µL of 96-100% ethanol. The resulting mixture was processed according to the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit protocol. RNA was eluted in 20 µL of RNase-free water. RNA quality and concentration were assessed using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and a Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), respectively. Samples with a RNA Integrity Number (RIN) greater than 8 and a concentration exceeding 10 ng/µL were retained. Extracted RNA was stored at -80°C, while aliquots intended for Bioanalyzer analysis were kept at -20°C.

Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) were incorporated into the read headers of raw fastq files using UMI-tools version 1.1.2. Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on May-2024. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and MultiQC (version 1.25.2) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Samples with total read pairs exceeding 150 million were downsampled to 150 million read pairs with seqtk (version 1.4-r122).     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.1 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.1/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4).

A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0), ERCC genes were removed, and the non-ERCC genes were normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1).

          "Study Protocol Description": "In the Rodent Research Reference Mission (RRRM-2), forty female C57BL/6NTac mice were flown on the International Space Station. To assess differences in outcomes due to age, twenty 12 week-old and twenty 29 week-old mice were flown, respectively. To directly assess spaceflight effects, half of the young and old mice (10 old, 10 young) were sacrificed on-orbit after 55-58 days (ISS Terminal, ISS-T), while the other half (10 old, 10 young) were returned live to Earth after 32 days and allowed to recover for 24 days (Live Animal Return, LAR) before sacrifice. ISS-T and LAR mice were the same age at sacrifice. Both the ISS-T and LAR animals had independent ground controls (10 mice per group housed in flight hardware in matched environmental conditions), basal controls (10 mice per group sacrificed 2 days before launch), and vivarium controls (10 mice per group housed within standard vivarium habitats). Thus RRRM-2 included a total of 160 mice. GeneLab only processed up to 5 mice from each of the young/old group from flight/ground control groups in this dataset. All mice (C57BL/6NTac) were sourced from Taconic Biosciences (Germantown, NY). Mice were weighed, chipped with BMDS RFID chip (IMI-500) and shipped to NASA KSC for delivery at approximately L-5 weeks. Mice were housed and maintained in the Animal Care Facility (ACF) at NASA KSC with 12:12 light cycle matched in timing to the light cycle used for Transporters and Habitats programmed for flight. All mice were housed in cages of 5 mice/cage with the same littermates as they had been raised. Mice were initially given ad lib standard lab chow and water, which was changed on a schedule of 2x per week. Mice were housed initially on standard bedding and provided with igloo as enrichment material. Animal health was checked daily by appropriately trained NASA personnel and contracted lab technicians. At L-4 weeks, mice were placed on raised mesh flooring to simulate spaceflight Transporter and Habitat cage conditions, given water delivered through lixits identical to those used in the flight hardware and put on the NASA Nutrient-Upgraded Rodent Foodbars (NuRFB). Food and water were changed weekly, and mice were weighed bi-weekly. Igloo was provided as enrichment material in all cages. At L-12 days, mice were grouped (10 mice per cage) in larger cages for social acclimation prior to launch. Groupings were done based on age of animals and in a manner to establish similar average weights between any given grouping. At L-2 days, baseline, spaceflight and ground control groups were identified. At L-1 day, spaceflight animals were loaded into spaceflight Transporters. Habitat Ground Control (HGC) mice were loaded into Transporters on a 3-day offset from spaceflight animals. Vivarium Ground Control (VGC) mice (also on a 3-day offset) were returned to 5 mice/cage and placed on standard bedding and provided water through typical sipper tubes at launch equivalent. All mice were maintained on NuRFB throughout the duration of the study. Spaceflight and HGC mice were given new food at weekly intervals. VGC mice were given new food and fresh water also on weekly intervals. An enrichment Hut, in the form of a grated shelter, was provided in the habitat for the flight and habitat ground control group. Igloo was provided in the vivarium ground control group. After splashdown, flight LAR mice were transferred to the animal care facility at Scripps Research Institute where they were assessed and re-caged into standard caging conditions (5 mice/cage, standard bedding and ad lib water from regular sipper tubes). LAR and ISS-T Ground Control mice were shipped from Kennedy Space Center to Scripps and housed under the same conditions as the flight mice. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     For ISS terminal (ISS-T) group, mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and euthanized by means of cardiac puncture blood draw (exsanguination) and double thoracotomy. A list of tissues including right brain hemisphere were dissected fresh from each carcass. The right brain hemisphere was dissected and placed directly in a cryotube and rapidly frozen using the ISS rapid freeze system. For Live Animal Return (LAR) group, mice were anesthetized with gas anesthesia and euthanized by means of cardiac puncture blood draw (exsanguination) and double thoracotomy. Right hemispheres were partially embedded in Optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT compound) to maintain the orientation and placed on dry ice until frozen throughout, then stored in -80 C freezer for sample processing. The remaining right hemispheres were snap frozen on liquid nitrogen and stored in -80 C freezer. All groups (baseline, flight, habitat and vivarium ground controls) were treated identically. Selected flight and habitat ground control groups of both LAR OCT-embedded right brain hemispheres and ISS-T frozen right brain hemispheres were shipped on dry ice to SciLifeLab Stockholm, KTH Royal Institute of Technology for processing to generate the data in this study.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample--ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was 'living', including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://www.nasa.gov/reference/osdr-environmental-data/.     Cryosectioning were performed at by SciLifeLab following 10X Genomics Visium protocol. https://www.10xgenomics.com/spatial-transcriptomics/  Visium is a commercially available kit produced by 10x Genomics, which allows to spatially visualize the gene expression of tissue sections. Cerebellum and hippocampus were split from the right brain hemisphere, embedded in OCT compound, cryosectioned and placed on Visium Gene Expression arrays.     Sample preparations were performed at by SciLifeLab following 10X Genomics Visium protocol (https://www.10xgenomics.com/spatial-transcriptomics). On the Visium Gene Expression array, the tissue is fixed, stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin and imaged. Imaging step is followed by tissue permeabilization in order to release mRNA from each section. The mRNA molecules are captured by barcoded probes in their spatial location of the array surface. Subsequently, synthesis of cDNA is performed.     Sequencing library constructions were performed by SciLifeLab following 10X Genomics Visium protocol. (https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression) and sent to NASA GeneLab for sequencing.     Sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Paired end: read 1 at 28 bp and read 2 at 90 bp. PhiX included as control at 1%. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs. After initial assessment, a different serial section from the following 2 samples was re-imaged and sequenced by SciLifeLab with Paired end: read 1 at 28 bp and read 2 at 150 bp: RRRM2_HPC_FLT_ISS-T_YNG_FY6 and RRRM2_HPC_FLT_LAR_OLD_FO2.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on May-2024. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.17) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     RNA was extracted from mouse right brain tissue using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mouse brains were cryosectioned at a thickness of 10 µm, and 15 to 30 sections from each brain were collected for RNA extraction. For homogenization, the cryosections were placed in 2 mL Lysing Matrix D tubes (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) and disrupted using the FastPrep (MP Biomedicals) set at 6.0 m/s for 40 seconds. During disruption, the samples were mixed with 350 µL of a solution prepared by adding 10 µL of β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) to 1 mL of Buffer RLT Plus (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After homogenization, the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature to remove cell debris. The supernatant was transferred to a gDNA Eliminator spin column and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 seconds to eliminate genomic DNA. The flow-through containing RNA and proteins was collected and combined with 250 µL of 96-100% ethanol. The resulting mixture was processed according to the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit protocol. RNA was eluted in 20 µL of RNase-free water. RNA quality and concentration were assessed using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and a Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), respectively. Samples with a RNA Integrity Number (RIN) greater than 8 and a concentration exceeding 10 ng/µL were retained. Extracted RNA was stored at -80°C, while aliquots intended for Bioanalyzer analysis were kept at -20°C. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat 4456739, v92), Mix 1 or Mix 2, were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol.

GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA ribo depletion and library preparation was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) following GeneLab SOP 5.1 Ilumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Lirary Prep using epMotion. Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN greater than 4. Index adapters used were at 1.5 µM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit. Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scentific, Waltham, MA) following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as following: Read 1: 151 bp, Index1: 17 bp, Index2: 8 bp, Read 2: 151 bp. PhiX v3 included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     Data from 5 old ISS-T flight animals, 3 old ISS-T ground control (GC) animals, 4 young ISS-T flight animals, 3 young ISS-T GC animals, 3 old LAR flight animals, 3 old LAR GC animals, 3 young LAR flight animals, and 3 young LAR GC animals are available. Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) were incorporated into the read headers of raw fastq files using UMI-tools version 1.1.2. Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on May-2024. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Samples with total read pairs exceeding 150 million were downsampled to 150 million read pairs with seqtk (version 1.4-r122).     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.0 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.0/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0), ERCC genes were removed, and the non-ERCC genes were normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value.

          "Study Protocol Description": "Cryosectioning were performed at by SciLifeLab following 10X Genomics Visium protocol. https://www.10xgenomics.com/spatial-transcriptomics/ Visium is a commercially available kit produced by 10x Genomics, which allows to spatially visualize the gene expression of tissue sections. Cerebellum and hippocampus were split from the right brain hemisphere, embedded in OCT compound, cryosectioned and placed on Visium Gene Expression arrays.     Sample preparations were performed at by SciLifeLab following 10X Genomics Visium protocol (https://www.10xgenomics.com/spatial-transcriptomics). On the Visium Gene Expression array, the tissue is fixed, stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin and imaged. Imaging step is followed by tissue permeabilization in order to release mRNA from each section. The mRNA molecules are captured by barcoded probes in their spatial location of the array surface. Subsequently, synthesis of cDNA is performed.     Sequencing library constructions were performed by SciLifeLab following 10X Genomics Visium protocol. (https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression) and sent to NASA GeneLab for sequencing,     Sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Paired end: read 1 at 28 bp and read 2 at 90 bp. PhiX included as control at 1%. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Twenty (20) mice (female, 10 B6129SF2/J Wild Type (WT) and 10 B6;129S2-Cdkn1atm1Tyj/J (p21-null), 14-15 weeks old) were launched in one Transporter on SpaceX-21 (SpX-21) on December 6, 2020. The Flight (FL) mice were transferred into two Rodent Habitats upon arrival to the International Space Station (ISS) and were maintained in microgravity for 28-29 days. At 7 days before euthanasia (December 26 and 27, 2020), all 20 mice received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection with the bone formation marker (Calcein). At about 48 +/- 2 hours before euthanasia (December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2021), all 20 mice received an IP injection with a second dose of Calcein as well as the cell proliferation marker (BrdU). At approximately 28-29 days in microgravity (January 2 and 3, 2021), the Flight mice were euthanized with a Ketamine/Xylazine cocktail, followed by cardiac puncture and thoracotomy. Following skin removal, both hindlimb quarters were removed and preserved or fixed. Each carcass was wrapped in aluminum foil, preserved in the CryoChiller, and stored at -80C or colder until return to PI. Two other groups of mice, 20 for Ground Control (GC) and 24 for Vivarium Control (VIV), half B6129SF/J Wild Type (WT) and half B6;129S2-Cdkn1atm1Tyj/J (p21-null), were selected by the PI and underwent the same procedures and treatment as the Flight group but with an offset of 3 days. In addition to the IP injections (Calcein and BrdU) described above, all mice in the FL, GC, and VIV groups also received a pre-flight subcutaneous injection of the bone marker (Alizarin Red). Twenty (20) female mice (half WT and half p21-null) were selected by the PI for the Baseline Control (BL) group. Following a successful Launch, baseline animals were injected with Calcein at the time of Launch (7 days prior to dissection) and at 48 +/- 2 hours before dissection. BL animals were also injected with BrdU at 48 +/- 2 hours before dissection. Baseline dissections were performed 7 days after launch following the same procedures used for the Flight animals. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     At the end of RR-10 experiment, all frozen carcasses and preserved hindlimbs were returned to the PI. In May 2021, the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) team performed complex and integrated dissections at NASA Ames Research Center with the Principal Investigator team. Right brain hemispheres were partially embedded in Optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT compound) to maintain the orientation and placed on dry ice until frozen throughout, then stored in -80 C freezer for sample processing. The remaining right hemispheres were snap frozen on liquid nitrogen and stored in -80 C freezer. GeneLab only processed the samples from Wild Type animals of spaceflight and ground control groups in this dataset. Five each of the right brain hemispheres from spaceflight and ground control groups were shipped on dry ice to SciLifeLab Stockholm, KTH Royal Institute of Technology for processing.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample--ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was 'living', including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://www.nasa.gov/reference/osdr-environmental-data/.     RNA was extracted from mouse brain tissue using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mouse brains were cryosectioned at a thickness of 10 uM, and 15 to 30 sections from each brain were collected for RNA extraction. For homogenization, the cryosections were placed in 2 mL Lysing Matrix D tubes (MP Biomedicals) and disrupted using the FastPrep (MP Biomedicals) set at 6.0 m/s for 40 seconds. During disruption, the samples were mixed with 350 uL of a solution prepared by adding 10 uL of β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) to 1 mL of Buffer RLT Plus (Qiagen). After homogenization, the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature to remove cell debris. The supernatant was transferred to a gDNA Eliminator spin column and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 seconds to eliminate genomic DNA. The flow-through containing RNA and proteins was collected and combined with 250 uL of 96-100% ethanol. The resulting mixture was processed according to the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit protocol. RNA was eluted in 20 uL of RNase-free water. RNA quality and concentration were assessed using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and a Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), respectively. Samples with a RNA Integrity Number (RIN) greater than 8 and a concentration exceeding 10 ng/uL were retained. Extracted RNA was stored at -80°C, while aliquots intended for Bioanalyzer analysis were kept at -20°C. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat 4456739, v92), Mix 1 or Mix 2, were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol. SOP 5.2 Use of ERCC Spike-In Mixes and UMRR Controls for Total RNA Sequencing. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA ribo depletion and library preparation was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) following GeneLab SOP 5.1 Ilumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep using epMotion. Input RNA were approximately 500nG with RIN greater than 4. Index adapters used were at 1.5uM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit. Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scentific, Waltham, MA) following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as following: Read 1: 151 bp, Index1: 17 bp, Index2: 8 bp Read 2: 151 bp. PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) were incorporated into the read headers of raw fastq files using UMI-tools version 1.1.2. Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on May-2024. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Samples with total read pairs exceeding 150 million were downsampled to 150 million read pairs with seqtk (version 1.4-r122).     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.1 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.1/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0), ERCC genes were removed, and the non-ERCC genes were normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis_GLbulkRNAseq.html report.",

          "Study Description": "The objective of the Rodent Research-10 mission (RR-10) was to investigate how spaceflight affects the cellular and molecular mechanisms of normal bone tissue regeneration in space. To this end, ten (10) 14-15 weeks-old female B6129SF2/J  Wild Type (WT), and ten (10) 14-15 weeks-old female B6;129S2-Cdkn1atm1Tyj/J (p21-null) mice received a pre-flight subcutaneous injection of the bone marker (Alizarin Red), and were then delivered to the ISS aboard SpaceX-21. At 7 days before euthanasia, all 20 mice received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection with a bone formation marker (Calcein). At 48 +/- 2 hours before euthanasia, all 20 mice received an IP injection with a second dose of Calcein as well as a cell proliferation marker (BrdU). Then, following 28-29 days in microgravity, the Flight mice were euthanized. Following removal of hindlimbs, carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, preserved in the CryoChiller, and stored at -80 C or colder until return to Earth. In addition to the Flight group, three ground control groups were also part of the study: Basal (representing the pre-launch state), Vivarium (standard vivarium housing for the same duration of time as flight), and Ground (flight habitat in the International Space Station Environment Simulator, ISSES). Twenty mice (10 of each strain) were included in each of these control groups (except Vivarium which included 12 of each strain). These were treated, euthanized and processed on the same schedule and in the same manner as the flight samples. This study includes bulk RNA sequencing and spatially resolved transcriptional profiling data from hippocampi from 5 WT flight animals and 5 WT ground control animals. Hippocampi from the right hemisphere were embedded and cryosectioned. Cryosections were either processed for bulk RNA sequencing or placed on gene expression arrays, stained and imaged. Imaging was followed by tissue permeabilization to release mRNA molecules from cells for capture onto the array surface. Subsequently, spatial transcriptomics libraries were prepared and sequenced.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "50 micro-litter of plasma aliquot after removal of cell debris was resuspended with 750 micro-litter of TRIzol-LS and 200 micro-litter of water. RNA was purified following standard protocol.     2.5 micro-litter of total RNA was used for library prep with NEBNext Small RNA Library Kit (New England Biolabs, cat. no. E7330S). Small-RNA library preparation was used due to RNA degradation.     2 x 36 base paired-end sequencing with NextSeq500 (Illumina) were performed.     Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.     FASTQ files were imported to CLC Genomics Workbench (Ver.10.1.1, Qiagen). Reads were mapped to mouse reference genome (mm10) and quantified for 49,585 genes. Total counts were normalized by quantile method. Differentially expressed genes were identified using Empirical Analysis of DGE tool in CLC Genomics Workbench.     Three weeks prior to launch (L-21d), 100 mice (5 weeks old) were delivered from Jackson Lab to KSC. Then the 100 mice were acclimatized to the environment for three weeks in individual housing cages (Small Mouse Isolator 10027, Lab Products Inc., USA) in an air-conditioned room (temperature: 23+/-3C; humidity: 40-65%) with a 12:12-h light-dark cycle at the SSPF Science Annex at KSC. Three acclimation phases were set: Phase I, body weight recovery phase (L-21d to L-14d); Phase II, water nozzle acclimation (L-14d to L-7d) and Phase III, flight food acclimation (L-7d to launch). After approximately three weeks of acclimation, the mice were ready for transport and reached the age of 8 weeks. Briefly, at Phase I, mice were fed CRF-1 and given water ad libitum using ball-type water nozzles. The drinking water was autoclaved tap water. The bedding material consisted of paper chips (ALPHA-DRI). At Phase II, water nozzles are changed to flight nozzles. Finally, at Phase III, the food was changed to flight food. Fecal collection and body swabs were obtained at L-13d, and these samples were sent to Charles River Laboratories in the USA for PCR-based SPF testing. During the acclimation phase, body weight and food/water consumption were measured and recorded. Four days prior to launch (L-4d), 78 mice were divided into six subgroups of 13 mice (12 mice for flight and one backup mouse for contingencies such as ear punching failure). The selection of flight candidate mice was based on body weight, food consumption and water intake. Health of each flight candidate mouse was checked by evaluating the condition of their eyes, ears, teeth, fur and tail. The six subgroups were necessary to support possible launch attempts in case of unexpected postponements.     Five-week-old C57BL/6J male mice (Stock  000664) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories (USA) for the space experiment and from the Charles River Laboratories (Japan) for ground experiments. One day prior to launch (L-1d), 12 mice at 8 weeks of age were loaded into the TCU and made ready for launch. Flight mice were launched to space on board the SpX9 on 18 July 2016 (EDT) from the KSC. After arriving at the ISS, mice were relocated from the TCU to the HCU by the crew, where the animals were housed for 35 days. Before mice were returned to the ground, centrifugation was halted and they were transferred to the SpX9 Dragon capsule. The capsule splashed down in the Pacific Ocean offshore from California on 26 August 2016 (GMT). Following splashdown, the TCU containing mice was unloaded from the SpX9 Dragon capsule and transported to Long Beach Airport on 28 August 2016 (GMT). The TCU was handed over to JAXA at the airport and then transported to a laboratory in San Diego (Explora Biolabs) by an environmentally controlled van. Returned mice were euthanized and dissected at the laboratory to collect tissues. The HCU was equipped with a food bar, watering system (two redundant water nozzles and a water balloon acting as power-free pressure source), an odour filter, two fans (for redundancy) for air ventilation, waste collecting equipment, an LED/IR video camera with a wiper inside the cage to keep the observation window clean. Paper sheets were mounted on the cage wall to quickly eliminate liquid from the cage, such as urine. A photocatalytic thermal spray was applied to the sheets for deodorising and antibacterial effects. Air ventilation inside the cage was maintained by airflow (less than 0.2m/s) generated by fans on the HCU. Differences in the volume of air ventilation and airflow rate between HCU in artificial and microgravity conditions is negligible because the fans regulating ventilation in both gravity conditions are maintained at the same speed. The day/night cycle uses 12h intervals. Feed and water resupply are required once a week. Logs of temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide and ammonia can be monitored. The TCU was used to transport mice aboard the SpaceX Dragon space vehicle in the launch and return phases, and it was placed in a powered locker sized for ISS single cargo transfer. The TCU contains 12 cylindrical cages for housing mice individually. The TCU is equipped with a cylindrical food bar, watering system (two redundant water nozzles and a water balloon), an odour philtre, two fans (for redundancy), waste collecting equipment and LEDs with lights for day and night cycles. Paper sheets mounted in the waste collection area were treated with photocatalytic thermal spray for deodorising and antibacterial effects, similar to the HCU. A temperature/humidity logger was attached on the TCU air inlet to monitor the environment during subsequent operations.     After unberthing from the ISS, the Dragon vehicle splashed down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California. After a ship picked up the cargo, the returned TCU was transported to a port in Long Beach. JAXA later received the TCU from NASA and transported it to Explora Biolabs in San Diego for analysis. The health and body weights of mice were checked. Isoflurane-anesthetised mice were euthanized by exsanguination and dissected for the collection of tissue samples. Mouse blood samples were collected from the inferior vena cava under anesthesia, and transferred into a 1.5 ml microfuge tube containing EDTA-2K for a final concentration of 5 mM. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 1,500 g for 10 min, and collected into a fresh tube. A 100 μl aliquot was frozen and transported to the University of Tsukuba.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following GeneLab SOP 3.1-Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini with Qiagen RNase-Free DNase set. Homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 25mg of tissue was recovered, weighed, and immediately placed in 600microliter of the Buffer RLT solution. Homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix (Red, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 3 minutes at 4 C per SOP 2.1-Tissue homogenization Using Bullet Blender Gold Bead Beater. Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 minutes at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 35-45 microliter of RNAse free H2O, and DNA was eluted in 50 microliter RNAse free H2O. Concentration for all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR kit following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). DNA quality and size were assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with Agilent gDNA ScreenTape Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat 4456739, v92), Mix 1 or Mix 2, were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol. SOP 5.2 Use of ERCC Spike-In Mixes and UMRR/UHRR Controls for Total RNA Sequencing. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA ribo depletion and library preparation was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) following GeneLab SOP 5.1 Ilumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep using epMotion. Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN above 4. Index adapters used were at 1.5 micromolar (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit. Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Two separate libraries were made from the same extracted RNA for samples RR23_Cb_GC_G1, RR23_Cb_VIV_V5 and RR23_Cb_FLT_F1, to give technical replicates 1 and 2 for each sample. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as following: Read 1: 151bp, Index1: 17bp, Index2: 8bp; Read 2: 151bp. PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     UMIs were extracted from fastq files using UMI-tools (version 1.1.2). Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.2 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.2/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0), ERCC genes were removed, and the non-ERCC genes were normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. For samples with technical replicates, only the first replicate was used for count normalization and differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis_GLbulkRNAseq.html report.     Twenty (20) mice (male, C57BL/6J, 16-17 weeks old) were launched in one Transporter on SpaceX-21 (SpX-21) on December 6, 2020. The Flight mice were transferred into two Rodent Habitats upon arrival to the International Space Station (ISS) and were maintained in microgravity for 38 days. The Flight mice were transferred into a Transporter and returned to Earth for Live Animal Return (LAR) on SpX-21 (January 13th, 2021). After Atlantic Ocean splashdown, the LAR Flight mice were transported via helicopter to Kennedy Space Center. Collectively, 20 Flight, 20 HGC, and 20 VGC mice were transferred from Rodent Transporters (Flight and HGC) or vivarium cages (VGC) and placed into shipping containers. All 60 mice were flown via charter plane to the PI's institution, Texas A and M University (TAMU). The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol (Protocol number RR-23) was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     All post-flight euthanasia and dissections were performed by the PI team at TAMU. The original plan was to perform all pre-flight and post-flight activities at Roskamp Institute in Sarasota, Florida. Due to the health risks associated with travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, HRP approved all post-flight activities at TAMU, which significantly decreased or eliminated travel for the PI, BSP, and Payload Developer (PD) teams. Upon arrival at the TAMU Animal Care Facility (ACF), the mice underwent post-flight procedures, followed by euthanasia and tissue collection by the PI team. GeneLab only processed 9/9/8 samples from Flight/HGC/VGC groups in this dataset.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS.

Flight mice were then returned to Earth alive (Jan 13th, 2021). After splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean, mice were transported to Kennedy Space Center via helicopter. The 20 Flight, 20 Habitat Ground Control (HGC), and 20 Vivarium Ground Control (VGC) mice were removed from Rodent Transporters (Flight and HGC) or vivarium cages (VGC), placed into shipping containers, and flown to Texas A and M University. There, mice underwent post flight procedures, before euthanasia and tissue collection. Flight, HGC and VGC animals were euthanized and dissected on Jan 14th, 17th or 20th of 2021, respectively. Cerebellums were preserved by immersion in RNAlater and stored at -80 ˚C until RNA was extracted, and libraries generated and sequenced (target 60 M clusters per sample, PE 150 bp). This dataset features 9 samples from the Flight group, 9 samples from the HGC group, and 8 samples from the VGC group. A technical replicate is included for one sample in each group.

GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA ribo depletion and library preparation was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) following GeneLab SOP 5.1 Ilumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Lirary Prep using epMotion. Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN above 4. Index adapters used were at 1.5 micromolar (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit. Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scentific, Waltham, MA) following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Two separate libraries were made from the same extracted RNA for samples RR23_TMS_GC_G1, RR23_TMS_VIV_V1 and RR23_TMS_FLT_F6, to give technical replicates 1 and 2 for each sample. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as following: Read 1: 151bp, Index1: 17bp, Index2: 8bp; Read 2: 151bp. PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     UMIs were extracted from fastq files using UMI-tools (version 1.1.2). Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.0 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.0/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. Note that since greater than 60% of the reads in samples RR23_TMS_FLT_F2, RR23_TMS_FLT_F6_techrep1, and RR23_TMS_FLT_F6_techrep2 were classified as unalignable to the transcriptome by RSEM, they were excluded from count normalization and differential expression analysis. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0), ERCC genes were removed, and the non-ERCC genes were normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. For samples with technical replicates, only the first replicate was used for count normalization and differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis_GLbulkRNAseq.html report.",

Homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 30mg of tissue was recovered, weighed, and immediately placed in 600microliter of the Buffer RLT solution. Homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix (Navy, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 3 minutes at 4 ˚C per SOP 2.1-Tissue homogenization Using Bullet Blender Gold Bead Beater. Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 minutes at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 microliter of RNAse free H2O, and DNA was eluted in 50 microliter RNAse free H2O.

Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis_GLbulkRNAseq.html report.     Twenty (20) mice (male, C57BL/6J, 16-17 weeks old) were launched in one Transporter on SpaceX-21 (SpX-21) on December 6, 2020. The Flight mice were transferred into two Rodent Habitats upon arrival to the International Space Station (ISS) and were maintained in microgravity for 38 days. The Flight mice were transferred into a Transporter and returned to Earth for Live Animal Return (LAR) on SpX-21 (January 13th, 2021). After Atlantic Ocean splashdown, the LAR Flight mice were transported via helicopter to Kennedy Space Center. Collectively, 20 Flight, 20 HGC, and 20 VGC mice were transferred from Rodent Transporters (Flight and HGC) or vivarium cages (VGC) and placed into shipping containers. All 60 mice were flown via charter plane to the PI's institution, Texas A and M University (TAMU). The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol (Protocol number RR-23) was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     All post-flight euthanasia and dissections were performed by the PI team at TAMU. The original plan was to perform all pre-flight and post-flight activities at Roskamp Institute in Sarasota, Florida. Due to the health risks associated with travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, HRP approved all post-flight activities at TAMU, which significantly decreased or eliminated travel for the PI, BSP, and Payload Developer (PD) teams. Upon arrival at the TAMU Animal Care Facility (ACF), the mice underwent post-flight procedures, followed by euthanasia and tissue collection by the PI team. GeneLab only processed 9 samples each from Flight, VGC and HGC groups in this dataset.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://www.nasa.gov/reference/osdr-environmental-data/.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Isolation of total RNA from the brain tissues was performed using DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (Qiagen,   80224) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, tissue homogenization was performed using 1.5 mm beads (Benchmark,   1032-15) on Minilys homogenizer (Bertin Technologies) in RLT Plus buffer. The purity and concentration of the eluted RNA were measured using Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and stored at −80 °C until further analysis.     RNA samples (20 ng/ul) were shipped to Nanostring (Technologies Seattle, WA) and gene expression profiling of brain tissues was conducted using the nCounter® Neuroflammation Gene Expression panel. nCounter CodeSet utilizes target-specific Capture Probes and color-coded Reporter Probes (CodeSet), which hybridize directly with a target-specific sequences of the single-stranded RNA in solution. Codeset hybridization is carried out overnight (MANUAL-10083-01,nCounter®Gene Expression Panels Overview).     nCounter technology digitally detects barcoded individual target molecules through unique probe pair for each target molecule. Digital images are then processed by the nCounter instrument, and the Reporter Probe counts are received tabulated for further analysis (MANUAL-10083-01,nCounter®Gene Expression Panels Overview).     Ten-weeks-old male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories, Inc. Bar Harbor, ME) at the time of launch, were flown for NASA’s ninth Rodent Research experiment (RR-9) on SpaceX-12 for a 35-day mission and lived in NASA’s Rodent Habitats aboard the International Space Station. All FLT mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26–28 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle during the flight. Habitat GC mice were kept under similar housing conditions, including temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels using 48-h delayed telemetry data from the FLT group. Water and food bar diet specifically designed by NASA were provided ad libitum to FLT and GC groups. All mice received the same access to food and water. NASA-Ames Research Center and KSC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees approved this flight study. The study has been done in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Health.     Within 38 ± 4 h of splashdown, the FLT mice were rapidly euthanized in 100% CO2. The GC mice were euthanized with the same method after 38 days of GC housing. Shortly after euthanasia, brains were removed and bisected along the midline and coronally within the half hemispheres. The right caudal half hemisphere of the brain (containing mid- and hindbrain) from each mouse (n  equals  5–6 per group) was placed in a sterile cryovial, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C prior to use.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.",

          "Study Description": "The health risk from spaceflight-induced neuronal damage and potential adverse neurovascular effects is a chief concern. More recently, it has been proposed that neuroinflammatory response plays an important role in the neurovascular remodeling in the brain after stress. The goal of the present study was to characterize changes in the gene expression of neuroinflammation panel for inflammation, neuronal function, metabolism and stress in mouse brain tissue. Ten-week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 for a 35-day mission. Within 38+4 hours of splashdown, mice were returned to Earth alive. Brain tissues were collected for analysis. Habitat ground control (GC) mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware cages. A novel digital color-coded barcode counting technology (NanoStringTM) was used to evaluate gene expression profiles in the spaceflight mouse brain. The Neuroinflammation panel includes 757 genes covering the core pathways and processes that define neuroimmune interactions. A set of 54 differently expressed genes (p less than 0.05) significantly segregates the GC group from flight (FLT) group. Many pathways associated with cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism were significantly altered by flight conditions. Genes supporting neuronal synaptic signaling and migration were significantly downregulated in FLT compared to the GC mice. A decrease in the expression of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance was observed. Moreover, mRNA expression of many genes related to antiviral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response were significantly downregulated. These data indicate that neuroinflammation and altered immune reactions may be closely associate with spaceflight-induced stress response and have an impact on the neuronal function that may result in chronic neuroinflammation and late neurodegeneration. A total of 12 frozen right caudal half hemispheres containing mid- and hindbrain from GC and FLT mice (n equals 6 per group), were used for analysis",

          "Study Protocol Description": "AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA):  Homogenization buffer for DNA and RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use.  Each tissue sample was weighed as a whole and then cut into pieces that were roughly 30-50mg in weight.  Each fraction was  immediately placed in 500 uL of the Buffer RLT solution without thawing the tissue. Homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix (Zirconium 2.0mm RINO Lysis, Next Advance)  on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 4 minutes (speed setting of 12) at 4°C.  Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The lysate from each tissue fraction were then recombined so that each tissue had a larger stock of  concentrated lysate. A portion of supernatant was taken from each tube that was equivalent to 25mg of tissue RLT was then added to bring all the tubes to the same volume.  This normalized fraction was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer protocol.  RNA was eluted in 50 uL RNAse free H2O, and DNA was eluted in 50 uL EB buffer. Concentration for all RNA and DNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR kit.  RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) or the Agilent RNA ScreenTape Assay (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat   4456739, v92) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol. Mix1 was used for LAR VC and LAR HC. Mix 2 wax used for LAR FL and any UMRR control samples. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA ribo depletion done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN greater than 4.  Index adapters were 1.5 uM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters).  15 cycles PCR were performed.  Library fragment size ~300 bp was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).  Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scentific, Waltham, MA).  Library quality control was determined by iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Paired end 149bp. PhiX included as control. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     UMIs were extracted from fastq files using UMI-tools (version 1.1.2). Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.3 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.3/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), distance between forward and reverse reads using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. The data were normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor*. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis.html report.\n\n*ERCC-normalized data are available upon request.     All mice (BALB/cAnNTac) were sourced from Taconic Biosciences (Germantown, NY).  Mice were weighed, chipped with BMDS RFID chip (IMI-500) and shipped to NASA KSC for delivery at L-4 weeks.  Mice were housed and maintained in the Animal Care Facility (ACF) at NASA KSC with 12:12 light cycle matched in timing to the light cycle used for Transporters and Habitats programmed for flight.  All mice were housed in cages of 5 mice/cage with the same littermates as they had been raised.  Mice were initially given ad lib standard lab chow and water, which was changed on a schedule of 2x per week.  Mice were housed initially on standard bedding and provided igloo-type enrichment.  Animal health was checked daily by appropriately trained NASA personnel and contracted lab technicians.  At L-3 weeks, mice were placed on raised mesh flooring to simulate spaceflight Transporter and Habitat cage conditions, given water delivered through lixits identical to those used in the flight hardware and put on the NASA Nutrient-Upgraded Rodent Foodbars (NuRFB).  Food and water was changed weekly and mice were weighed bi-weekly.  Igloo-type enrichment was provided in all cages. At L-10 days, mice were grouped (10 mice per cage) in larger cages for social acclimation prior to launch.  Groupings were done based on age of animals and with regard to establishing similar average weights between any given grouping.  At L-2 days, baseline, flight and ground control groups were identified.  At L-1 day, flight (FLT) animals were loaded into spaceflight Transporters.  Habitat Ground Control (GC) mice were loaded into Transporters on a 3-day offset from flight animals.  Vivarium Ground Control (VGC) mice (also on a 3-day offset) were returned to 5 mice/cage and placed on standard bedding and provided water through typical sipper tubes at launch equivalent.  All mice were maintained on NuRFB throughout the duration of the study.  Flight and HGC mice were given new food at weekly intervals.  VGC mice were given new food and fresh water also on weekly intervals. Mold contamination of food: Spaceflight and Habitat Ground Control mice were exposed to mold in their food to unknown relative degrees. The Vivarium Control and Baseline Control mice had clean food throughout their habitation. Loose food bars: Food bars came loose and fell to the bottom of the cage for the HGC mice and was free floating for the Spaceflight mice. This did not prevent the mice from eating. This may have caused some degree of stress for these animals that would have been experienced differently between the Spaceflight and HGC groups. Live animal return: Because weather in the Pacific was very poor, mice experienced double density housing (10 per cage instead of 5) for at least 7 days instead of the expected 2-3 days. Habitat Ground Control mice were treated the same way but this duration of double-density housing probably created additional stress on both groups of mice. In addition, because of rough seas, the Spaceflight mice might have experienced some sea sickness-type conditions that would not have been experienced by the HGC mice.     Live Animal Return (LAR) mammary gland samples: Mice were anesthetized with gas anesthesia (isoflurane) and euthanized by means of cardiac puncture blood draw (exsanguination) and double thoracotomy. The mammary glands were removed, weighed, and snap frozen on liquid nitrogen. Tissues were frozen within 10-16 minutes of thoracotomy procedure. All groups (baseline, flight, habitat and vivarium ground controls) were treated identically. Mammary Gland  samples were maintained at -80C or lower temperatures throughout the storage during transportation and shipment. Baseline (BSL) samples were dissected at the time of launch.\n\nIt should be noted that for the BSL dissections a substitute scientist took over part way through, due to the large discrepancies in the BSL tissues they were not included in this analysis. The FLT, GC, and VGC were dissected by one person and the tissue collection was more precise and consistent.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module.

To directly assess spaceflight effects, half of the young and old mice (10 old, 10 young) were sacrificed on-orbit after 22-23 days (ISS Terminal, ISS-T), while the other half (10 old, 10 young) were returned live to Earth after 40 days and allowed to recover for 2 days (Live Animal Return, LAR) before sacrifice. Both the ISS-T and LAR animals had independent ground controls (10 mice housed in flight hardware in matched environmental conditions), basal controls (10 mice sacrificed 1 day after launch), and vivarium controls (10 mice housed within standard vivarium habitats). Thus RRRM-1 included a total of 160 mice. This datasets features ribodepleted total RNA-seq data from mammary glands dissected from six LAR groups (young and old for flight, ground control, and vivarium control).

          "Study Protocol Description": "Twenty (20) mice (male, C57BL/6J, 16-17 weeks old) were launched in one Transporter on SpaceX-21 (SpX-21) on December 6, 2020. The Flight mice were transferred into two Rodent Habitats upon arrival to the International Space Station (ISS) and were maintained in microgravity for 38 days. The Flight mice were transferred into a Transporter and returned to Earth for Live Animal Return (LAR) on SpX-21 (January 13th, 2021). After Atlantic Ocean splashdown, the LAR Flight mice were transported via helicopter to Kennedy Space Center. Collectively, 20 Flight, 20 HGC, and 20 VGC mice were transferred from Rodent Transporters (Flight and HGC) or vivarium cages (VGC) and placed into shipping containers. All 60 mice were flown via charter plane to the PI's institution, Texas A and M University (TAMU). The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol (Protocol number RR-23) was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     All post-flight euthanasia and dissections were performed by the PI team at TAMU. The original plan was to perform all pre-flight and post-flight activities at Roskamp Institute in Sarasota, Florida. Due to the health risks associated with travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, HRP approved all post-flight activities at TAMU, which significantly decreased or eliminated travel for the PI, BSP, and Payload Developer (PD) teams. Upon arrival at the TAMU Animal Care Facility (ACF), the mice underwent post-flight procedures, followed by euthanasia and tissue collection by the PI team. GeneLab only processed 9/9/9 spleen samples from Flight/HGC/VGC groups in this dataset.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.     RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following GeneLab SOP 3.1-Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini with Qiagen RNase-Free DNase set. Homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 20mg of tissue was isolated using a scalpel, weighed, and immediately placed in 600 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix - Zirconium Oxide 2.0mm  (Next Advance, Troy, NY) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance, Troy, NY) for 5 minutes at 4C per SOP 2.1-Tissue homogenization Using Bullet Blender Gold Bead Beater. Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 minutes at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 uL RNAse free H2O, and DNA was eluted in 50 uL RNAse free H2O. Concentration for all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR kit following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). DNA quality and size were assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with Agilent gDNA ScreenTape Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat 4456739, v92), Mix 1 or Mix 2, were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol. Following SOP 5.2 Use of ERCC Spike-In Mixes and UMRR/UHRR Controls for Total RNA Sequencing. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA ribo depletion and library preparation was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN greater than 4. Index adapters used were at 1.5 uM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit. Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scentific, Waltham, MA) following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs. Libraries from sample RR23_SPL_GC_G6 were made using two aliquots of same RNA of 500ng each and sequenced, making up technical replicates 1 and 2.     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as following: Read 1: 151bp, Index1: 17bp, Index2: 8bp Read 2:151bp. PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     UMIs were extracted from fastq files using UMI-tools (version 1.1.2). Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.0 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.0/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. Note that since greater than 60% of the reads in samples RR23_SPL_GC_G5, RR23_SPL_VIV_V1, and RR23_SPL_VIV_V9 were classified as unalignable to the transcriptome by RSEM, they were excluded from count normalization and differential expression analysis. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0), ERCC genes were removed, and the non-ERCC genes were normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. For samples with technical replicates, only the first replicate was used for count normalization and differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis_GLbulkRNAseq.html report.",

There, mice underwent post flight procedures, before euthanasia and tissue collection. Flight, HGC and VGC animals were euthanized and dissected on Jan 14th, 17th or 20th of 2021, respectively. Spleens were preserved by immersion in RNAlater and stored at -80C until RNA was extracted, and libraries generated and sequenced (target 60 M clusters per sample, PE 150 bp). This dataset features 9 samples from the Flight group, 10 samples from the HGC group, and 9 samples from the VGC group.",

In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip).

Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0), ERCC genes were removed, and the non-ERCC genes were normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. For samples with technical replicates, only the first replicate was used for count normalization and differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis_GLbulkRNAseq.html report.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Twenty (20) mice (male, C57BL/6J, 16-17 weeks old) were launched in one Transporter on SpaceX-21 (SpX-21) on December 6, 2020. The Flight mice were transferred into two Rodent Habitats upon arrival to the International Space Station (ISS) and were maintained in microgravity for 38 days. The Flight mice were transferred into a Transporter and returned to Earth for Live Animal Return (LAR) on SpX-21 (January 13th, 2021). After Atlantic Ocean splashdown, the LAR Flight mice were transported via helicopter to Kennedy Space Center. Collectively, 20 Flight, 20 HGC, and 20 VGC mice were transferred from Rodent Transporters (Flight and HGC) or vivarium cages (VGC) and placed into shipping containers. All 60 mice were flown via charter plane to the PI’s institution, Texas A and M University (TAMU). The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol (Protocol number RR-23) was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     All post-flight euthanasia and dissections were performed by the PI team at TAMU. The original plan was to perform all pre-flight and post-flight activities at Roskamp Institute in Sarasota, Florida.  Due to the health risks associated with travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, HRP approved all post-flight activities at TAMU, which significantly decreased or eliminated travel for the PI, BSP, and Payload Developer (PD) teams. Upon arrival at the TAMU Animal Care Facility (ACF), the mice underwent post-flight procedures, followed by euthanasia and tissue collection by the PI team. GeneLab only processed 9/8/9 samples each from Flight/HGC/VGC groups in this dataset.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://www.nasa.gov/reference/osdr-environmental-data/.     RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following GeneLab SOP 3.1-Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini with Qiagen RNase-Free DNase set. Homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 25mg of tissue was isolated using a scalpel, weighed, and immediately placed in 600 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix - Zirconium Oxide 2.0mm (Next Advance, Troy, NY) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance, Troy, NY) for 3 minutes at 4C per SOP 2.1-Tissue homogenization Using Bullet Blender Gold Bead Beater. Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 minutes at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 uL RNAse free H2O, and DNA was eluted in 50 uL RNAse free H2O. Concentration for all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR kit following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). DNA quality and size were assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with Agilent gDNA ScreenTape Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat 4456739, v92), Mix 1 or Mix 2, were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol. Following SOP 5.2 Use of ERCC Spike-In Mixes and UMRR/UHRR Controls for Total RNA Sequencing. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA ribo depletion and library preparation was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN more than 4. Index adapters used were at 1.5 uM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit. Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scentific, Waltham, MA) following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs. Libraries for samples RR23_LNG_FLT_F7 and RR23_LNG_GC_G2 were sequenced twice making up technical replicates 1 and 2 for each sample.     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as following: Read 1: 151bp, Index1: 17bp, Index2: 8bp Read 2:151bp. PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs. All samples except for RR23_LNG_FLT_F2, RR23_LNG_FLT_F7_techrep2, RR23_LNG_GC_G1, RR23_LNG_GC_G2_techrep2, and RR23_LNG_GC_G5, were sequenced on the same NovaSeq run, and samples RR23_LNG_FLT_F2, RR23_LNG_FLT_F7_techrep2, RR23_LNG_GC_G1, RR23_LNG_GC_G2_techrep2, and RR23_LNG_GC_G5 were sequenced together on a subsequent NovaSeq run.     UMIs were extracted from fastq files using UMI-tools (version 1.1.2). Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.11) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.2 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.2/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0), ERCC genes were removed, and the non-ERCC genes were normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. For samples with technical replicates, only the first replicate was used for count normalization and differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis_GLbulkRNAseq.html report.",

GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA ribo depletion and library preparation was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN more than 4. Index adapters used were at 1.5 uM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit. Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scentific, Waltham, MA) following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs. Libraries for samples RR23_LVR_GC_G1 and RR23_LVR_FLT_F7, were sequenced twice to give technical replicates 1 and 2 for each sample. Three separate libraries were created from the same extracted RNA for sample RR23_LVR_FLT_F8, to give technical replicates 1, 2 and 3.     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as following: Read 1: 151bp, Index1: 17bp, Index2: 8bp Read 2:151bp. PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs. All samples except for RR23_LVR_FLT_F7_techrep2, RR23_LVR_FLT_F8_techrep3, RR23_LVR_FLT_F9, RR23_LVR_GC_G1_techrep2, and RR23_LVR_GC_G5, were sequenced on the same NovaSeq run, and samples RR23_LVR_FLT_F7_techrep2, RR23_LVR_FLT_F8_techrep3, RR23_LVR_FLT_F9, RR23_LVR_GC_G1_techrep2, and RR23_LVR_GC_G5 were sequenced together on a subsequent NovaSeq run.     UMIs were extracted from fastq files using UMI-tools (version 1.1.2). Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.2 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.2/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0), ERCC genes were removed, and the non-ERCC genes were normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. For samples with technical replicates, only the first replicate was used for count normalization and differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis_GLbulkRNAseq.html report.",

To this end, twenty male, C57BL/6J, 16-17 weeks-old mice were delivered to the ISS on SpaceX-21 in a single transporter, transferred to two rodent habitats, and maintained in microgravity for 38 days. Flight mice were then returned to Earth alive (Jan 13th, 2021). After splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean, mice were transported to Kennedy Space Center via helicopter. The 20 Flight, 20 Habitat Ground Control (HGC), and 20 Vivarium Ground Control (VGC) mice were removed from Rodent Transporters (Flight and HGC) or vivarium cages (VGC), placed into shipping containers, and flown to Texas A and M University. There, mice underwent post-flight procedures, before euthanasia and tissue collection. Flight, HGC and VGC animals were euthanized and dissected on Jan 14th, 17th or 20th of 2021, respectively. Livers were preserved by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 C until RNA was extracted, and libraries generated and sequenced (target 60 M clusters per sample, PE 150 bp). This dataset features 9 samples from the Flight and VGC groups, and 8 samples from the HGC group.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Twenty (20) mice (female, 10 B6129SF2/J Wild Type (WT) and 10 B6;129S2-Cdkn1atm1Tyj/J (p21-null), 14-15 weeks old) were launched in one Transporter on SpaceX-21 (SpX-21) on December 6, 2020. The Flight (FL) mice were transferred into two Rodent Habitats upon arrival to the International Space Station (ISS) and were maintained in microgravity for 28-29 days. At 7 days before euthanasia (December 26 and 27, 2020), all 20 mice received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection with the bone formation marker (Calcein). At about 48 +/- 2 hours before euthanasia (December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2021), all 20 mice received an IP injection with a second dose of Calcein as well as the cell proliferation marker (BrdU). At approximately 28-29 days in microgravity (January 2 and 3, 2021), the Flight mice were euthanized with a Ketamine/Xylazine cocktail, followed by cardiac puncture and thoracotomy. Following skin removal, both hindlimb quarters were removed and preserved or fixed. Each carcass was wrapped in aluminum foil, preserved in the CryoChiller, and stored at -80C or colder until return to PI. Two other groups of mice, 20 for Ground Control (GC) and 24 for Vivarium Control (VIV), half B6129SF/J Wild Type (WT) and half B6;129S2-Cdkn1atm1Tyj/J (p21-null), were selected by the PI and underwent the same procedures and treatment as the Flight group but with an offset of 3 days. In addition to the IP injections (Calcein and BrdU) described above, all mice in the FL, GC, and VIV groups also received a pre-flight subcutaneous injection of the bone marker (Alizarin Red). Twenty (20) female mice (half WT and half p21-null) were selected by the PI for the Baseline Control (BL) group. Following a successful Launch, baseline animals were injected with Calcein at the time of Launch (7 days prior to dissection) and at 48 +/- 2 hours before dissection. BL animals were also injected with BrdU at 48 +/- 2 hours before dissection. Baseline dissections were performed 7 days after launch following the same procedures used for the Flight animals. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     At the end of RR-10 experiment, all frozen carcasses and preserved hindlimbs were returned to the PI. In May 2021, the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) team performed complex and integrated dissections at NASA Ames Research Center with the Principal Investigator team. Kidney tissues were preserved by flash freezing in LN2. Samples were kept at -80C freezer until processing. GeneLab only processed the samples from Wild Type animals in this dataset.     Kidney tissue was pulverized in to fine powder using BioSpec MultiSample BioPulverizer tool (Biospec, Bartlesville, OK) pre-chilled on dry ice. 12 kidney samples were processed at a time, in between batches the Biopulverizer was washed twice with 70% EtOH and rinsed with RNase/DNase free water. Each pulverized kidney sample was mixed in the BioPulverizer well and the powder was split evenly between two pre-chilled 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes. Tubes were kept on dry ice before transfer to -80C storage. RNA was isolated from each tube with half the kidney mass from ten (10) Basal, twelve (12) Vivarium,  ten (10) Flight and ten (10) Ground Control samples. RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following GeneLab SOP 3.1-Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini with Qiagen RNase-Free DNase set. Homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. The powdered kidney mass was added to 700 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix (Navy, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 3 minutes at 4C and speed on 12 per SOP 2.1-Tissue homogenization Using Bullet Blender Gold Bead Beater. Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 4C and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. Volume corresponding to 25mg of tissue of the supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 uL RNAse free water, and DNA was eluted in 50 uL RNAse free water. Concentration for all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR kit following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).

GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     All samples were normalized to an input of 10ng of total RNA and added to the QIAseq UPX 3' Transcriptome kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD), following SOP 5.4-QIAseq UPX 3' Transcriptome Library Preparation. Sample RINs were greater than 7.5. For one sample, RR10_KDN_WT_FLT_F5, extracted RNA was aliquoted in to 5 separate Cell ID wells, samples labeled techrep 1-5. Cell IDs, which are used to distinguish individual samples, are added to each sample during the RT step. Samples were pooled together after the RT step. An input of 50ng of pooled cDNA was used to carry out library construction. Library fragment size for this pool of samples is ~569 bp and was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following protocol SOP 6.3-Quality Analysis of Sequencing Libraries Using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit. Final library concentration and pooled library concentration were measured by qPCR with the QuantSudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), following SOP 6.7-Sequencing Library Quantification using QIAseq Library Quant Assay.

UMIs were extracted from fastq files using UMI-tools (version 1.1.2). Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Raw data were generated as described in GL-DPPD-7108 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Raw_Data_Generation/UPX_kit_for_bulk_RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7108_Versions/GL-DPPD-7108.md). In short, cell IDs, used to distinguish individual samples, were extracted from fastq files containing reads from multiple samples using UMI-tools (version 1.1.2). Extracted cell IDs were used to demultiplex fastq files to create one fastq file per individual sample. Raw fastq files from individual samples were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using individual Slurm scripts. In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Samples prepared with the same library preparation method were processed together for count normalization and subsequent differential gene expression (DGE) analysis. For samples with multiple technical replicates, only the first technical replicate was used for count normalization and subsequent DGE analysis. For each set of samples, the runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and when applicable sample technical replicates were manually removed. The runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. The data were normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor*. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis.html reports.\n\n*ERCC-normalized data are available upon request.     Kidney tissue was pulverized in to fine powder using BioSpec MultiSample BioPulverizer tool (Biospec, Bartlesville, OK) pre-chilled on dry ice. 12 kidney samples were processed at a time, in between batches the Biopulverizer was washed twice with 70% EtOH and rinsed with RNase/DNase free water. Each pulverized kidney sample was mixed in the BioPulverizer well and the powder was split evenly between two pre-chilled 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes. Tubes were kept on dry ice before transfer to -80C storage. One tube with half the kidney mass from ten (10) Basal, ten (10) Vivarium and ten (10) Flight pulverized samples were shipped to Thermo Fisher Center for Multiplexed Proteomics center at Harvard Medical School in Boston, MA for proteomics analysis. Samples were prepared essentially as previously described [PMIDs: 29734811, 33900084], with a few modifications.  Pulverized tissue was resuspended in 2 mL of lysis buffer (8M urea, 200 mM EPPS, pH 8.5 supplemented with 1X Pierce protease and phosphatase inhibitors). The resuspended samples were passed though a 1.5 inch 21 gauge needle to ensure DNA were sheared. Protein concentration was determined for each sample with BCA. Samples were reduced with 5 mM TCEP at room temperature for 20 min, alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for 20 min in the dark, and then quenched with 10 mM DTT at room temperature for 20 min in the dark. Of this lysate, 50 µg per replicate were used for the whole proteome work for each sample, while 5 mg per replicate were set aside for the phosphoproteome analysis. Methanol-chloroform precipitation was performed prior to protease digestion. In brief, 4-parts neat methanol were added to each sample and vortexed, 1-part chloroform was added to the sample and vortexed, and 3-parts water was added to the sample and vortexed. The sample was centrifuged at 14,000 RPM for 2 min at room temperature and subsequently washed once with 100% methanol.     Samples were resuspended in 200 mM EPPS, pH 8.5 and digested at room temperature for 14 h with Lys-C protease at a 50:1 protein-to-protease ratio. Trypsin was then added at a 100:1 protein-to-protease ratio and the reaction was incubated for 6 h at 37°C.     120 µg of TMTpro reagents (Thermo-Fisher; Lot  :WL338745) were added to the peptides (50 µg) along with acetonitrile to achieve a final acetonitrile concentration of approximately 30% (v/v) in a total volume of 100 µL. Following incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the reaction was quenched with hydroxylamine to a final concentration of 0.3% (v/v). The sample was vacuum centrifuged to near dryness and subjected to C18 solid-phase extraction (SPE, Sep-Pak).     We fractionated the peptide samples using BPRP HPLC . We used an Agilent 1200 pump equipped with a degasser and a UV detector. Peptides were subjected to a 50-min linear gradient from 5% to 35% acetonitrile in 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8 at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min over an Agilent 300Extend C18 column (3.5 μm particles, 4.6 mm ID and 250 mm in length). The peptide mixture was fractionated into a total of 96 fractions, which were consolidated into 24 super-fractions (in a checkerboard-like pattern). Samples were subsequently acidified with 1% formic acid and vacuum centrifuged to near dryness. Each consolidated fraction was desalted by StageTip, and reconstituted in 5% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid for LC-MS/MS processing.     Mass spectrometric data were collected on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer coupled to a Proxeon NanoLC-1200 UHPLC (ThermoFisher Scientific). A 100 µm capillary column was packed in-house with 35 cm of Accucore 150 resin (2.6 μm, 150Å; ThermoFisher Scientific). Data were acquired for 90 min per fraction. The scan sequence began with an MS1 spectrum: Orbitrap analysis, resolution 60,000, 400−1600 Th, automatic gain control (AGC) target 400K, maximum injection time 50 ms. MS2 analysis consisted of collision-induced dissociation (CID), quadrupole ion trap analysis, AGC 10K, NCE (normalized collision energy) 35, q-value 0.25, isolation window 0.6 Th, maximum injection time set to 35 and TopSpeed set at 1.25 sec. An on-line real-time search algorithm (Orbiter) was used to trigger MS3 scans for quantification [PMID: 32126768].  For the MS3 scan (performed in the OrbiTrap), we used higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD) with NCE 55%, AGC 200K, maximum injection time 200 ms, resolution 50,000 at 400 Th, isolation window 1.2. The close out was set at two peptides per protein per fraction. [PMID: 32126768].  For High-field Asymmetric-waveform Ion Mobility spectrometry (FAIMS), the dispersion voltage (DV) was held constant at 5000V, the compensation voltages (CVs) were set at -40V, -60V, and -80V [PMID: 30672687].  In total 24 fractions were analyzed for each multiplexed experiment.     Database searching included all entries from the mouse UniProt Database (downloaded: 2021). The database was concatenated with one composed of all protein sequences for that database in the reversed order [PMID: 17327847]. Raw files were converted to mzXML, and monoisotopic peaks were re-assigned using Monocle [PMID: 33190505].  Searches were performed with Comet [PMID: 23148064] using a 50-ppm precursor ion tolerance for total protein level profiling. The product ion tolerance was set to 0.9 Da. TMTpro labels on lysine residues and peptide N-termini +304.207 Da), as well as carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (+57.021 Da) were set as static modifications, while oxidation of methionine residues (+15.995 Da) was set as a variable modification. Peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) were adjusted to a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) using a linear discriminant after which proteins were assembled further to a final protein-level FDR of 1% analysis [PMID: 21183079]. Proteins were quantified by summing reporter ion counts across all matching PSMs. More specifically, reporter ion intensities were adjusted to correct for the isotopic impurities of the different TMTpro reagents according to manufacturer specifications. Peptides were filtered to include only those with a summed signal-to-noise (SN) ≥ 100 across all TMT channels.  The signal-to-noise (S/N) measurements of peptides assigned to each protein were summed (for a given protein). These values were normalized so that the sum of the signal for all proteins in each channel was equivalent thereby accounting for equal protein loading. The resulting normalization factors will be used to normalize the phosphorylation sites as discussed below to again account for equal protein loading. Finally, each protein abundance measurement was scaled, such that the summed signal-to-noise for that protein across all channels equals 100, thereby generating a relative abundance (RA) measurement.     Following digestion, peptides were desalted by using 500mg SepPak columns. The elutions were dried via vacuum centrifugation and the phosphopeptides were enriched with the High-Select Fe3+-NTA Phosphopeptide Enrichment Kit according to manufacturer’s specifications using approximately 5 mg protein digest per enrichment column. The elutions were again dried via vacuum centrifugation.     In general, we estimate that at most 25 ug of phosphopeptides were enriched from the 5 mg of total peptide. We added 50 ug of TMTpro reagent (Thermo-Fisher; Lot  :WL338745)  to the peptides (~25 µg) along with acetonitrile to again achieve a final acetonitrile concentration of approximately 30% (v/v) in a total volume of 50 µL. Following incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the reaction was quenched with hydroxylamine to a final concentration of 0.3% (v/v). The sample was vacuum centrifuged to near dryness and subjected to C18 solid-phase extraction (SPE, Sep-Pak).     We fractionated the peptide samples using BPRP HPLC . We used an Agilent 1200 pump equipped with a degasser and a UV detector. Peptides were subjected to a 50-min linear gradient from 5% to 35% acetonitrile in 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8 at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min over an Agilent 300Extend C18 column (3.5 μm particles, 4.6 mm ID and 250 mm in length). The peptide mixture was fractionated into a total of 96 fractions, which were consolidated into 12 super-fractions (collected down each column, i.e., perpendicular to the direction of collection). Samples were subsequently acidified with 1% formic acid and vacuum centrifuged to near dryness. Each consolidated fraction was desalted by StageTip, and reconstituted in 5% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid for LC-MS/MS processing.     Mass spectrometric data were collected on an Orbitrap Eclipse mass spectrometer coupled to a Proxeon NanoLC-1200 UHPLC (ThermoFisher Scientific). The 100 µm capillary column was packed in-house with 35 cm of Accucore 150 resin (2.6 μm, 150Å; ThermoFisher Scientific). Data were acquired for 120 min per fraction. The scan sequence began with an MS1 spectrum: Orbitrap analysis, resolution 120,000, 400−1500 Th, automatic gain control (AGC) target 400K, maximum injection time 50 ms. MS2 analysis, which occurred in the OrbiTrap, consisted of higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD), AGC  150K, NCE (normalized collision energy) 36, isolation window 0.5 Th, maximum injection time set to 250 and TopSpeed set at 1.5 sec.  Each of the samples were shot twice using two sets of compensation voltages. For FAIMS, the dispersion voltage (DV) was held constant at 5000V, the compensation voltages (CVs) were set at -35V, -50V, and -65V for the first shot and -40 and -55V for the second shot. In total each of the 12 fractions were run twice, for a total of 24 runs for each multiplexed experiment.     Searches were performed as above but with product ion tolerance was set to 0.02 Da (as the MS2 scans are high-resolution) and phosphorylation (+79.966) was additionally set as variable modifications. AScore was used to determine site localization [PMID: 16964243], with a score of 13 denoting 95% confidence for a specified phosphorylation site. Phosphorylation sites were quantified by summing reporter ion counts across all matching PSMs. More specifically, reporter ion intensities were adjusted to correct for the isotopic impurities of the different TMTpro reagents according to manufacturer specifications.  Peptides were filtered to include only those with a summed signal-to-noise (SN) ≥ 100 across all TMT channels.  An extra filter of an isolation specificity (“isolation purity”) of at least 0.5 in the MS1 isolation window was applied for the phosphorylated peptide analysis.  The signal-to-noise (S/N) measurements of peptides were globally normalized using the protein normalization factors mentioned above to account for equal protein loading.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample--ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was 'living', including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.",

          "Study Description": "The objective of the Rodent Research-10 Mission (RR-10) was to investigate how spaceflight affects the cellular and molecular mechanisms of normal bone tissue regeneration in space. To this end, ten (10) 14-15 weeks-old female B6129SF2/J Wild Type (WT), and ten (10) 14-15 weeks-old female B6;129S2-Cdkn1atm1Tyj/J (p21-null) mice received a pre-flight subcutaneous injection of the bone marker (Alizarin Red), and were then delivered to the ISS aboard SpaceX-21. At 7 days before euthanasia, all 20 mice received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection with a bone formation marker (Calcein). At 48 +/- 2 hours before euthanasia, all 20 mice received an IP injection with a second dose of Calcein as well as a cell proliferation marker (BrdU). Then, following 28-29 days in microgravity, the Flight mice were euthanized. Following removal of hindlimbs, carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, preserved in the CryoChiller, and stored at -80 C or colder until return to Earth. In addition to the Flight group, three ground control groups were also part of the study: Basal (representing the pre-launch state), Vivarium (standard vivarium housing for the same duration of time as flight), and Ground (flight habitat in the International Space Station Environment Simulator, ISSES). Twenty mice (10 of each strain) were included in each of these control groups (except Vivarium which included 12 of each strain). These were treated, euthanized and processed on the same schedule and in the same manner as the flight samples. At the end of RR-10 experiment, all frozen carcasses were partially thawed and kidney tissues were removed and preserved by flash freezing in LN2. Kidneys were kept at -80 C freezer until processing. To ensure that both transcriptional profiling and protein expression profiling datasets are representative of the entire kidney, whole kidneys were first pulverized into a fine powder on dry ice. This powder was then split into two equal fractions with half being used for RNA isolation and half being used for protein isolation. RNA was used to generate three different transcriptional profiling datasets: a 3' tag-Seq datasets (20 M clusters at SE 93 bp), a polyA enriched dataset (60 M clusters at PE 150 bp), and a ribodepleted dataset (60 M clusters at PE 150 bp). Protein was used to generate protein expression profiling, and phosphoprotein profiling using the iTRAQ method (Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation). Transcriptional profiling dataset features WT samples from the Flight, Ground, Basal and Vivarium groups. Protein expression profiling and phosphoprotein profiling datasets exclude the Vivarium group.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "A cohort of Sprague-Dawley rats were flown on the space shuttle while housed in Research Animal Housing Facility (RAHF) cages and were subjected to microgravity for 14 days.  Rats of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground control studies and were housed in SL-3 (SpaceLab-3) simulated cages while being exposed to identical environmental conditions as the FLT group except for noise profile, acceleration, and vibration.  Rats were flown back and upon landing, flight and control rats were dissected.     Rats were decapitated upon live animal return and dissected.  The thymus tissue was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen before being stored at -70C long term.     RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following SOP 3.1-Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNa Mini with Qiagen RNase-Free DNase set. Homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 20 mg of tissue was thawed on ice, isolated using a scalpel, weighed and immediately placed in 700 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix (Zirconium 2.0mm RINO Lysis, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 5 minutes at 4C per SOP  2.1-Tissue homogenization Using Bullet Blender Gold Bead Beater. Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 uL RNAse free H2O, and DNA was eluted in 50 uL EB buffer. Concentration for all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR kit following SOP  4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following SOP  6.3-QC cDNA. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat 4456739, v92), Mix 1 or Mix 2, were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol. Protocol followed is SOP 5.2 Use of ERCC Spike-In Mixes and UMRR/UHRR Controls for Total RNA Sequencing. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     All samples were normalized to an input of 10ng of total RNA and added to the QIAseq UPX 3' Transcriptome kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD), following SOP 5.4-QIAseq UPX 3' Transcriptome Library Preparation. Sample RINs greater than 8.2.  Cell IDs, which are used to distinguish individual samples, are added to each sample during the RT step.  This allows samples to be pooled together after the RT step and carry out library preparation on a pool of samples as opposed to individual samples.  An input of 50ng of pooled cDNA was used to carry out library construction.  Library fragment size for this pool of samples is ~577 bp and was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following protocol SOP  6.3-Quality Analysis of Sequencing Libraries Using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit.  Final library concentration and pooled library concentration were measured by qPCR with the QuantSudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), following SOP  6.7-Sequencing Library Quantification using QIAseq Library Quant Assay.  Library quality control was determined by iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).  GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Asymmetric paired end (Read 1: 93bp, Index: 6pb, Read 2: 28bp). PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     Cell IDs, used to distinguish individual samples, were extracted from fastq files containing reads from multiple samples using UMI-tools (version 1.1.1). Extracted cell IDs were used to demultiplex fastq files to create one fastq file per individual sample. Raw fastq files from individual samples were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on Sept-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.3 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.3/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Rattus norvegicus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version mRatBN7.2 (Rattus_norvegicus.mRatBN7.2.dna.toplevel.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Rattus_norvegicus.mRatBN7.2.107.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Rattus norvegicus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and filtered to limit normalization and differential gene expression to Cut2 samples only. The runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. The data were normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor*. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Rn.eg.db (version 3.15.0). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis.html report.\n\n*ERCC-normalized data are available upon request.",

          "Study Description": "The Spacelab Life Sciences (SLS) program was a series of payloads that used the facilities of an entire Spacelab module to conduct a variety of life science investigations.  The general objective of the research in the SLS programs was to study the acute and chronic changes that living systems undergo during exposure to the space environment.  The specific objective of the Spacelab Life Sciences-2 (SLS-2) mission was to study the structural and functional changes occurring in the bone, muscle, blood, and balance systems of rats in response to space flight.  Rats were housed in individual cages in the Research Animal Holding Facility (RAHF) and natural calcium in the food bar was replaced with a non-radioactive calcium isotope (40Ca).  The General Purpose Transfer Unit (GPTU) was used to transfer rat cages from the RAHFs to the General Purpose Work Station (GPWS), enabling the crew to perform inflight experiment procedures on the rodents.  To this end, a flight group (FLT) of 38-day old male Sprague-Dawley rats were launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on 10/18/1993 and housed in Research Animal Housing Facility (RAHF) on the shuttle for 14 days before being returned alive to Earth. After splashdown, the FLT were decapitated, and dissection occurred on 11/1/1993. Asynchronous ground control animals (GC) were exposed identical environmental conditions as the FLT group except for noise profile, acceleration and vibration. GC animals were housed in SpaceLab-3 (SL-3) simulated cages and dissection occurred on 11/1/1993.  Upon dissection, thymus tissues were preserved in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 C before RNA was extracted.  This dataset features 6 FLT and 6 GC biological replicates.  In preparation for RNA extraction, thymus tissues were prepared by generating wedge cuts from the top and bottom of the tissue, designated as Cut1 and Cut2.  RNA was then extracted from both sets of cuts for all samples.  For all FLT and GC samples, purified RNA from Cut2 was selected for library construction.  Additionally, purified RNA from Cut1 was also selected for library construction for only one FLT and one GC sample, FLT_F15_Cut1 and GC_G12_Cut1, respectively, which also included four technical replicates (LibRep1-4).  All libraries were generated using the QIAseq UPX 3’ Transcriptome kit that enables 3’ gene expression analysis from purified RNA and sequenced around 40 M clusters at SE 93 bp.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following SOP 3.1-Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNa Mini with Qiagen RNase-Free DNase set. Homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use.  Approximately 15-20 mg of tissue was weighed and immediately placed in 1.2 mL of the Buffer RLT solution. Tissue homogenization was performed using the Polytron Rotor Stator Homogenizer (Kinematica PT 1300 D) at 15 second intervals for a total of three intervals on an ice bath per the SOP  2.2-Tissue Homogenization using Polytron Rotor Stator Homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 minutes at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 uL RNAse-free H2O. Concentration for all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR kit following SOP  4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following SOP  6.3-QC cDNA. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat 4456739, v92), Mix 1 or Mix 2, were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol. Protocol followed is SOP 5.2 Use of ERCC Spike-In Mixes and UMRR/UHRR Controls for Total RNA Sequencing. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     All samples were normalized to an input of 10ng of total RNA and added to the QIAseq UPX 3' Transcriptome kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD), following SOP 5.4-QIAseq UPX 3' Transcriptome Library Preparation. Sample RINs greater than 7.3. Cell IDs, which are used to distinguish individual samples, are added to each sample during the RT step.  This allows samples to be pooled together after the RT step and carry out library preparation on a pool of samples as opposed to individual samples.  An input of 50ng of pooled cDNA was used to carry out library construction.  Library fragment size for this pool of samples is ~575 bp and was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following protocol SOP  6.3-Quality Analysis of Sequencing Libraries Using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit.  Final library concentration and pooled library concentration were measured by qPCR with the QuantSudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), following SOP  6.7-Sequencing Library Quantification using QIAseq Library Quant Assay.  Library quality control was determined by iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Asymmetric paired end (Read 1: 93bp, Index: 6pb, Read 2: 28bp). PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers.  GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     Raw data were generated as described in GL-DPPD-7108 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Raw_Data_Generation/UPX_kit_for_bulk_RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7108_Versions/GL-DPPD-7108.md). In short, cell IDs, used to distinguish individual samples, were extracted from fastq files containing reads from multiple samples using UMI-tools (version 1.1.1). Extracted cell IDs were used to demultiplex fastq files to create one fastq file per individual sample. Raw fastq files from individual samples were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.2 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.2/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Rattus Norvegicus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly mRatBN7 (Rattus_norvegicus.mRatBN7.2.dna.toplevel.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Rattus_norvegicus.mRatBN7.2.112.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Rattus Norvegicus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0), ERCC genes were removed, and the non-ERCC genes were normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Rn.eg.db (version 3.19.1). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis_GLbulkRNAseq.html report.     A cohort of Sprague-Dawley rats were flown on the space shuttle and singly housed in Research Animal Housing Facility (RAHF) cages and were subjected to microgravity for 9 days.  Rats of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground control studies housed in vivarium cages and were exposed to identical environmental conditions as the FLT group except for noise profile, acceleration, and vibration.  Rats were flown back and upon landing, flight and control rats were dissected. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     Rats were decapitated upon live animal return and dissected.  The lateral gastrocnemius tissue was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen before being stored at -70C long term.",

The general objective of the research in the SLS programs was to study the acute and chronic changes that living systems undergo during exposure to the space environment. The specific objective of the Spacelab Life Sciences-1 (SLS-1) mission was to study the responses of rats to spaceflight and a period of re-exposure to Earth’s gravity.  In addition, this mission allowed for the detailed studies on rodents flown in two different types of habitats (individual and group housed).  The goals were to (1) verify the Research Animal Housing Facility (RAHF) and Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) and the capability of these facilities to maintain healthy animals for experimental use; (2) compare changes in rats exposed to spaceflight to the changes seen at 1g in rats housed in identical flight hardware and exposed to a similar flight environmental profile; and (3) compare the changes seen in rats flown in the RAHF with those seen in rats flown in the AEM and to identify housing-related effects. To this end, a flight group (FLT) of 65-day old male Sprague-Dawley rats were launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on 6/5/1991 and singly housed in Research Animal Housing Facility (RAHF) on the shuttle for 9 days before being returned alive to Earth.

To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.5) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0), ERCC genes were removed, and the non-ERCC genes were normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1).

Due to crew time constraint, only two (out of ten) mice were dissected immediately after euthanasia to recover spleen and liver tissues on the ISS. The remaining eight animals were euthanized, then intact carcasses were placed in a pre-chilled cold stowage container and stored in the MELFI. There were respective cohorts of age-matched basal animals which were euthanized one day after launch as a baseline control (Basal control group) as well as age-matched ground control animals kept in an ISS Environmental Simulator at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a 4-day delay to mimic spaceflight conditions (Ground control group). In addition, the NASA Validation study also had a cohort of age-matched vivarium control animals that were housed in the vivarium cages and followed the same experimental timeline and process as the spaceflight animals (Vivarium control group). This dataset was generated only from Flight (n of 4) and Ground control (n of 8) animals that were euthanized and preserved intact on-orbit for subsequent dissection on the ground. Libraries were generated using a 3’ Tag-seq approach and sequenced at a depth of 40 M clusters (SE 93 bp).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "A cohort of 10 week-old male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory) were launched in one Transporter (10 mice per side), transferred to Rodent Habitats onboard the International Space Station (ISS) and maintained in microgravity for ~33 days (the SpaceX Dragon docked period). No crew activities were required except for standard animal transfers between the Transporter and Habitats, and other activities required to ensure animal welfare, such as health checks and NuRFB replenishments. Prior to Dragon unberth, all mice were transferred into a clean Transporter followed by transfer to a Dragon capsule and then returned to Earth alive. The duration from splashdown to handover of the mice payload at the pier was approximately 24 hours. After handover of mice to the NASA Rodent Research team, the mice were immediately transported to the animal facility at Loma Linda University for conducting post-flight rodent gait assessment and dissections. The primary investigator teams, BSP teams, and Rodent Research dissection Lead and team conducted the dissection process at LLU immediately following a health check and specimen sampling and acquisition of walking kinematic data and intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements. A Basal Control (BSL) was housed in standard cages at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and euthanized one day after launch of the FLT animals. Ground Control (GC) and Vivarium Control (VIV) studies were planned to commence at KSC approximately one-week after the conclusion of the flight experiments. Early termination of RR-9 Ground Control (GC): Due to Hurricane Irma in September 2017 in Florida, the RR9 GC experiments were prematurely terminated. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     Mice were euthanized, upon live animal return and dissected immediately. Each carcass dissection time was no longer than 1 hour from collection of the first tissue. Multiple tissues, including the spleen tissue, were collected from each carcass.     RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following SOP  3.1-Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNa Mini with Qiagen RNase-Free DNase set. Homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 20 mg of tissue was thawed on ice, isolated using a scalpel, weighed and immediately placed in 700 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix (Zirconium 2.0mm RINO Lysis, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 5 minutes at 4C per SOP  2.1-Tissue homogenization Using Bullet Blender Gold Bead Beater. Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 uL RNAse free H2O, and DNA was eluted in 50 uL EB buffer. Concentration for all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR kit following SOP  4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following SOP  6.3-QC cDNA. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat   4456739, v92), Mix 1 or Mix 2, were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol.  Protocol followed is SOP  5.2 Use of ERCC Spike-In Mixes and UMRR/UHRR Controls for Total RNA Sequencing. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     All samples were normalized to an input of 10ng of total RNA and added to the QIAseq UPX 3' Transcriptome kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD), following SOP  5.4-QIAseq UPX 3' Transcriptome Library Preparation.  Sample RINs greater than 3.5.  Cell IDs, which are used to distinguish individual samples, are added to each sample during the RT step.  This allows samples to be pooled together after the RT step and cary out library prepartion on a pool of samples as opposed to individual samples.  An input of 50ng of pooled cDNA was used to carry out library construction.  Library fragment size for this pool of samples is ~528 bp and was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following protocol SOP  6.3-Quality Analysis of Sequencing Libraries Using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit.  Final library concentration and pooled library concentration were measured by qPCR with the QuantSudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), following SOP  6.7-Sequencing Library Quantification using QIAseq Library Quant Assay.  Library quality control was determined by iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Asymmetric paired end (Read 1: 93bp, Index: 6bp, Read 2: 28bp). PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. Libraries were generated using a 3’ Tag-seq approach and sequenced at a depth of 40 M clusters (SE 93 bp).     Cell IDs, used to distinguish individual samples, were extracted from fastq files containing reads from multiple samples using UMI-tools (version 1.1.1). Extracted cell IDs were used to demultiplex fastq files to create one fastq file per individual sample. Raw fastq files from individual samples were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.0 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.0/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0), ERCC genes were removed, and the non-ERCC genes were normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1).

          "Study Description": "The objective of the Rodent Research-9 (RR-9) mission was to use mice to understand the molecular basis of phenomena that affect astronauts during long-duration spaceflight, particularly visual impairment, and joint tissue degradation. To this end, a flight group (FLT) of 10-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on 8/14/2017 and housed in Rodent Habitats on the ISS for 33 days before being returned alive to Earth. After splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, the animals were transported to Loma Linda University (LLU) for testing, euthanasia, and dissection on 9/18/2018. Ground Control (GC) studies were planned to commence at KSC approximately one-week after the conclusion of the flight experiments. However, all the GC mouse studies at KSC had to be cancelled due to Hurricane Irma and potential adverse effects on the animal housing facility. The GC studies were therefore rescheduled and begun in May 2018. The GC was euthanized and dissected 6/18/2018 - 6/20/2018. Because this resulted in a different cohort of mice being used for the GC controls as compared to the flight (FLT) groups, two cohort controls were included in the study. The first, Cohort Control 1 (CC_C1), was from the same cohort as the FLT animals and was sacrificed and dissected 4 days after the FLT group (9/22/2017). The second, Cohort Control 2 (CC_C2), was from the same cohort as the GC, and was sacrificed and dissected 2-8 days after the GC, (6/24/2018 - 6/26/2018). The CC_C1 and CC_C2 groups were housed in standard cages and fed standard chow in contrast to all other groups which received Rodent Foodbars. Upon dissection, spleen tissues were preserved in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 C before RNA was extracted. Only the flight (FLT, n of 10) and Ground Control (GC, n of 10) samples were processed and analyzed in this study. Libraries were generated using a 3’ Tag-seq approach and sequenced at a targeted depth of 40 M clusters (SE 93 bp).",

RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Asymetric paired end (Read 1: 93bp, Index: 6pb, Read 2: 28bp). PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     Cell IDs, used to distinguish individual samples, were extracted from fastq files containing reads from multiple samples using UMI-tools (version 1.1.1). Extracted cell IDs were used to demultiplex fastq files to create one fastq file per individual sample. Raw fastq files from individual samples were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.3 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.3/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), distance between forward and reverse reads using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. The data were normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor*. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis.html report.\n\n*ERCC-normalized data are available upon request.",

          "Study Description": "The objective of the Rodent Research-9 (RR-9) mission was to use mice to understand the molecular basis of phenomena that affect astronauts during long-duration spaceflight, particularly visual impairment, and joint tissue degradation. To this end, a flight group (FLT) of 10-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on 8/14/2017 and housed in Rodent Habitats on the ISS for 33 days before being returned alive to Earth. After splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, the animals were transported to Loma Linda University (LLU) for testing, euthanasia, and dissection on 9/18/2018. Ground Control (GC) studies were planned to commence at KSC approximately one-week after the conclusion of the flight experiments. However, all the GC mouse studies at KSC had to be cancelled due to Hurricane Irma and potential adverse effects on the animal housing facility. The GC studies were therefore rescheduled and begun in May 2018. The GC was euthanized and dissected 6/18/2018 - 6/20/2018. Because this resulted in a different cohort of mice being used for the GC controls as compared to the flight (FLT) groups, two cohort controls were included in the study. The first, Cohort Control 1 (CC_C1), was from the same cohort as the FLT animals and was sacrificed and dissected 4 days after the FLT group (9/22/2017). The second, Cohort Control 2 (CC_C2), was from the same cohort as the GC, and was sacrificed and dissected 2-8 days after the GC, (6/24/2018 - 6/26/2018). The CC_C1 and CC_C2 groups were housed in standard cages and fed standard chow in contrast to all other groups which received Rodent Foodbars. Upon dissection, thymus tissues were preserved in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 C before RNA was extracted. Only the flight (FLT, n of 10) and Ground Control (GC, n of 10) samples were processed and analyzed in this study. Libraries were generated using a 3’ Tag-seq approach and sequenced at a targeted depth of 40 M clusters (SE 93 bp).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "After 2 h from fixation, the ECs were transferred to the Minus Eighty-Degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) and stowed at −80 C until re-entry. Once the space experiment flight time and temperature profiles were known, the whole experiment was repeated on ground in the KEU-ST and KIC-SL hardware with the support of a Kubik Interface Simulation Station (KISS) module placed inside a laboratory tissue culture incubator.     The cell cultures were transferred to 2 mL test tubes, covered with their supernatant (containing over 70% of RNAlater), and centrifuged at 16 000g for 15 min at 4 C. The supernatant was carefully removed, leaving a volume of 100 uL to prevent cell loss. A MirVana PARIS kit (Ambion AM1556) was used for cell lysis, as well as for following RNA extraction and purification procedures. Cell lysis was performed by pipetting ice-cold cell disruption buffer (300 uL) on the cell culture-bearing support by vortexing for 30 s and by placing samples on the ice every 10 s. A 1.5% beta-mercaptoethanol denaturing solution (400 uL) was added to each tube; after a 5 min incubation on ice, an acid-phenol:chloroform solution (800 uL) was added to the lysate. After a 30 s agitation with vortex, the support was removed and samples were centrifuged at 10 000g for 20 min. The aqueous phase (700 uL) from each sample was transferred to another clean tube, and 1.25 volumes of 99.9% ethanol (875 uL) were added. Each solution was then loaded twice on a filter column in a collection tube and centrifuged at 15 000g for 70 s. The eluate was discarded, and complete miRNA Wash Solution 1 (700 uL) was added for centrifugation at 15 000g for 1 min. The eluate was again discarded, and complete Wash Solution 2/3 (500 uL) was added twice for centrifugation at 15 000g for 1 min. The eluate was again discarded, and the filter column was fully dried prior to transfer to a clean collection tube. RNAse-free water (40 uL) was deposited in each filter column and incubated for 10 min, and then total RNA (including small RNAs) was eluted by centrifugation at 15 000g for 5 min. Upon total RNA isolation, spectrophotometric measurements were performed with a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) to assess sample quality and yield before downstream transcriptomic analyses through RNA-seq. RNA concentrations resulted to be about 10 ng/uL.     RNA preparations were processed according to the Ultra-Low Input RNA-Seq (GeneWiz) pipeline, cf. https://web.genewiz.com/ultra-low-input-case-study. Standard libraries were prepared with the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs). Briefly, polyadenylated fractions were enriched, fragmented, and reverse-transcribed (first- and second-strand cDNAs). Ends were repaired, 5′-phosphorylated, and poly(A)-tailed. The resulting sequences were ligated to universal adapters and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified. Small RNA (chiefly miRNA) libraries were prepared aside by ligating adapters selectively to those 5′- and 3′-ends processed by the endoribonuclease Dicer. The resulting sequences were also reverse-transcribed and amplified by PCR. Yields were determined through the Qubit DNA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and NanoDrop, whereas size distribution was assessed with a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Viable sequencing templates were quantified via real-time PCR.     Sequencing was done on a HiSeq. 2500 (Illumina) sequencer, in 2 × 250 bp paired-end configuration.     C2C12 myoblasts (ATCC CRL-1772) at passage 6-10 were seeded at a density of 1,500 cells/cm2 on Thermanox coverslips (1.05 x 2.20 cm2) positioned at the bottom of ad hoc-prepared polydimethylsiloxane multiwell plates at L-96 h (where “L” stands for launch time). At L-72 h, samples were transferred to twelve experiment units (EUs, KEU-ST developed by Kayser Italia and qualified for flight to the ISS) loaded with cell culture medium (100 μg/ml FBS-coated NC dispersion in reservoir M1 of six EUs, whereas the remaining ones did not contain nanoparticles), saline solution (Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline with Ca2+/Mg2+, Gibco 14040141 in reservoir S) for cell rinse prior to fixation, and a fixative solution (RNAlater, Ambion AM7020 in reservoir F) for nucleic acid preservation. EUs (n equals 3 for each experimental class) were enclosed in experiment containers (ECs, KIC-SL developed by Kayser Italia and qualified for flight to the ISS) ensuring second-level containment and interface with the European Space Agency (ESA) Kubik incubator facility on board the ISS. Passive conditioned temperature (25-30°C) was kept from handover until hardware installation in Kubik incubator (set at 37°C) on board the ISS. Temperature was recorded with iButton data loggers every minute from completion of hardware assembly and verification until experiment end. Upload occurred with a Dragon/Falcon 9 vector (SpaceX CRS-17 mission). At L+81 h, ECs were placed in the Kubik incubator set at 37°C, and five fluidic activations were automatically performed at days 3, 5, 7, and 9 post launch. Activations 4 and 5 were in particular performed at day 9 (activation 5 with 5 min delay).     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.3 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.3/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7) changing the default NF_RCP-F 1.0.3 setting (Illumina) to trim for nextera adaptors instead. Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none (unstranded) and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported into R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Description": "For their remarkable biomimetic properties implying strong modulation of the intracellular and extracellular redox state, cerium oxide nanoparticles (also termed 'nanoceria') were hypothesized to exert a protective role against oxidative stress associated to the harsh environmental conditions of spaceflight, characterized by microgravity and highly energetic radiations. Nanoparticles were supplied to proliferating C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells under different gravity and radiation levels (microgravity+cosmic radiations or Earth gravity+cosmic radiations on board the International Space Station; Earth gravity on ground). Biological responses were thus investigated at a transcriptional level by RNA next-generation sequencing. Lists of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were generated and intersected by taking into consideration relevant comparisons, which led to the observation of prevailing effects of the space environment over those induced by nanoceria, possibly due to its administration during spaceflight. In space, up-regulation of transcription was slightly preponderant over down-regulation, and it implied involvement of intracellular compartments, with the majority of DEGs being consistently over- or under-expressed whenever present. Cosmic radiations regulated a higher number of DEGs than microgravity and seemed to promote increased cellular catabolism. By taking into consideration space physical stressors alone, microgravity and cosmic radiations appeared to have opposite effects at transcriptional level despite partial sharing of molecular pathways. Interestingly, gene ontology denoted some enrichment in terms related to vision, when only effects of radiation were assessed. The regulation of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 in space-relevant samples suggests perturbation of the intracellular redox homeostasis, and leaves open opportunities to antioxidant treatment for oxidative stress reduction in harsh environments. RNA-seq/miRNA-seq of C2C12 proliferating mouse myoblasts, cultured in the following conditions (n of 3): A (without nanoceria, in space without gravity), B (with nanoceria, in space without gravity), C (without nanoceria, in space with gravity), D (with nanoceria, in space with gravity), E (without nanoceria, on land), and F (with nanoceria, on land).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "All mice (C57BL/6NTac) were sourced from Taconic Biosciences (Germantown, NY). Mice were weighed, chipped with BMDS RFID chip (IMI-500) and shipped to NASA KSC for delivery at approximately L-5 weeks. Mice were housed and maintained in the Animal Care Facility (ACF) at NASA KSC with 12:12 light cycle matched in timing to the light cycle used for Transporters and Habitats programmed for flight. All mice were housed in cages of 5 mice/cage with the same littermates as they had been raised. Mice were initially given ad lib standard lab chow and water, which was changed on a schedule of 2x per week. Mice were housed initially on standard bedding and provided igloo-type enrichment. Animal health was checked daily by appropriately trained NASA personnel and contracted lab technicians. At L-4 weeks, mice were placed on raised mesh flooring to simulate spaceflight Transporter and Habitat cage conditions, given water delivered through lixits identical to those used in the flight hardware and put on the NASA Nutrient-Upgraded Rodent Foodbars (NuRFB). Food and water were changed weekly, and mice were weighed bi-weekly. Igloo-type enrichment was provided in all cages. At L-12 days, mice were grouped (10 mice per cage) in larger cages for social acclimation prior to launch. Groupings were done based on age of animals and in a manner to establish similar average weights between any given grouping. At L-2 days, baseline, spaceflight and ground control groups were identified. At L-1 day, spaceflight animals were loaded into spaceflight Transporters. Habitat Ground Control (HGC) mice were loaded into Transporters on a 3-day offset from spaceflight animals. Vivarium Ground Control (VGC) mice (also on a 3-day offset) were returned to 5 mice/cage and placed on standard bedding and provided water through typical sipper tubes at launch equivalent. All mice were maintained on NuRFB throughout the duration of the study. Spaceflight and HGC mice were given new food at weekly intervals. VGC mice were given new food and fresh water also on weekly intervals. An enrichment Hut, in the form of a grated shelter, was provided in the habitat. After splashdown, flight LAR mice were transferred to the animal care facility at Scripps Research Institute where they were assessed and re-caged into standard caging conditions (5 mice/cage, standard bedding and ad lib water from regular sipper tubes). LAR and ISS-T Ground Control mice were shipped from Kennedy Space Center to Scripps and housed under the same conditions as the flight mice. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n\nOnly LAR spaceflight and habitat ground control group samples were processed for scRNAseq in this dataset.     Live Animal Return (LAR): Mice were anesthetized with gas anesthesia and euthanized by means of cardiac puncture blood draw (exsanguination) and double thoracotomy. All groups (baseline, flight, habitat and vivarium ground controls) were treated identically. After isolation by the ISS team, an aliquot of whole blood was centrifuged at 2000g for 10 minutes to separate plasma and blood cells. Plasma was collected and the cell pellet was re-suspended using 5mL of red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer (10x in PBS) (BioLegend, cat# 420301). The cell suspension was incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. 7mL of PBS (Lonza, cat# 17-512Q) was added to the tube to quench the RBC lysis buffer. The tubes were centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes, after centrifugation the supernatant was collected and discarded without disturbing the cell pellet. Cell pellet was carefully resuspended in 350uL of FBS (Avantor, cat# 1300-500H lot# 023B19) and the whole volume was transferred in to a cryotube. Dropwise, 350uL of 20% DMSO (VWR, cat# VWRV0231-500ML) in FBS was added into the tube. Cryovials were put in Mr. Frosty (Nalgene, cat# C1562-1EA) filled with 250uL of 100% isopropanol for slow freezing. Day after cell isolation, vials were transferred from Mr. Frosty in to -80C storage box.     On the day of the library preparation, sample tubes were thawed by submerging the tubes in to 37C water bath for approximately 1 minute, until a small ice crystal remains. Cryotubes were transferred into a cell culture hood. Using a large bore pipette tips, cell suspension was collected and dropwise added in to 15mL tube containing 10mL of 37C RPMI media (Sigma, cat# R8758-1L), with 10% FBS (Gibco ref# 16000-044). The tubes were gently tilted side to side for 10-20 times and then incubated at room temperature for 1 minute. Cell suspension was centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes and the liquid was removed and discarded. Cell pellet was re-suspended in 2.5mL of fresh media and a cell count was performed using TC20 cell counter (BioRad, cat#1450102) . The tube was centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes. Supernatant was carefully removed and discarded and 2.5mL of 0.04% BSA (Sigma ref# A9418-10G) in PBS (HyClone ref# SH30028.03) was added on to the cell pellet dropwise. Cell pellet was carefully re-suspended, and another cell count was performed. Tubes were centrifuged once more at 300g for 5 minutes. After the centrifugation, the supernatant is carefully removed and discarded and the cell pellet was re-suspended in appropriate volume of 0.04% BSA in PBS, aiming for 800-1000 cells per uL at 60-80% viability. Cell count was performed. The cell suspension was passed through a Flowmi tip filter at 40um porosity (Bel-Art, cat # H13680-0040) and another count is performed to confirm cell density. Cell suspension tubes were placed on ice and immediately processed following 10X library preparation procedure.     10X Genomics procedure for library preparation was followed (10X Genomics, Single Cell 3’ v3 Gene Expression kit cat#1000075, 1000074, 120262). Using the Chromium Controller (10X Genomics, cat#1000204), the cells were encapsulated in Gel bead-in-Emulsion, or GEMs, which are individually tagged with a one of 750,000 independent barcodes. The targeted total cells in a single cell GEM suspension was 8,000 cells for bone marrow samples and 5,000 cells for PBMC and splenocyte samples. Within the GEM cell lysis, barcode association to mRNA, and reverse transcription (RT) was conducted in a single thermal cycler run. Following reverse transcription, the GEMs were ruptured, and the barcoded cDNA was cleaned-up and amplified using traditional wet bench methodologies. Clean-up was conducted using DynaBeads MyOne Silane magnetic beads and appropriate buffers, and 12 amplification cycles were completed using the provided reagents. Post amplification clean-up was conducted using SPRI select magnetic beads (Beckman Counter, cat#B23318) and the single cell cDNA barcode tagged libraries were eluted in EB Buffer (QIAgen, cat#19086). Sequencing libraries were quantified using Qubit 4 instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat#Q33238) with Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay (Invitrogen, cat#Q33231) and library quality was assessed with TapeStation 4200 instrument (Agilent, cat#G2991BA) with D1000 DNA ScreenTape Analysis assay (Agilent, cat#5067-5583 and cat#5067-5582).     scRNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. PhiX included as control. Read 1 contains cell barcode and UMI, and Read 2 contains sequence of interest.     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2). Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.9) was used to generate the raw MultiQC report.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7111. In short, raw fastq files were trimmed, filtered, then aligned using STAR (version 2.7.10a). Mus musculus STAR reference was built using STAR (version 2.7.10a), Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf. Reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) using the STARsolo options described in step 3a of GL-DPPD-7111, and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Gene counts, pre-mRNA counts, annotated and novel splice junctions, and spliced, unspliced and ambiguous counts per cell were calculated and reported.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.",

To assess differences in outcomes due to age, twenty 12 week-old and twenty 29 week-old mice were flown, respectively. To directly assess spaceflight effects, half of the young and old mice (10 old, 10 young) were sacrificed on-orbit after 55-58 days (ISS Terminal, ISS-T), while the other half (10 old, 10 young) were returned live to Earth after 32 days and allowed to recover for 24 days (Live Animal Return, LAR) before sacrifice. ISS-T and LAR mice were the same age at sacrifice. Both the ISS-T and LAR animals had independent ground controls (10 mice per group housed in flight hardware in matched environmental conditions), basal controls (10 mice per group sacrificed 2 days before launch), and vivarium controls (10 mice per group housed within standard vivarium habitats). Thus RRRM-2 included a total of 160 mice This study includes single cell transcriptional profiling data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 4 young LAR flight animals, 4 old LAR flight animals, 4 young LAR ground control animals, and 4 old LAR ground control animals.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "All mice (C57BL/6NTac) were sourced from Taconic Biosciences (Germantown, NY). Mice were weighed, chipped with BMDS RFID chip (IMI-500) and shipped to NASA KSC for delivery at approximately L-5 weeks. Mice were housed and maintained in the Animal Care Facility (ACF) at NASA KSC with 12:12 light cycle matched in timing to the light cycle used for Transporters and Habitats programmed for flight. All mice were housed in cages of 5 mice/cage with the same littermates as they had been raised. Mice were initially given ad lib standard lab chow and water, which was changed on a schedule of 2x per week. Mice were housed initially on standard bedding and provided igloo-type enrichment. Animal health was checked daily by appropriately trained NASA personnel and contracted lab technicians. At L-4 weeks, mice were placed on raised mesh flooring to simulate spaceflight Transporter and Habitat cage conditions, given water delivered through lixits identical to those used in the flight hardware and put on the NASA Nutrient-Upgraded Rodent Foodbars (NuRFB). Food and water were changed weekly, and mice were weighed bi-weekly. Igloo-type enrichment was provided in all cages. At L-12 days, mice were grouped (10 mice per cage) in larger cages for social acclimation prior to launch. Groupings were done based on age of animals and in a manner to establish similar average weights between any given grouping. At L-2 days, baseline, spaceflight and ground control groups were identified. At L-1 day, spaceflight animals were loaded into spaceflight Transporters. Habitat Ground Control (HGC) mice were loaded into Transporters on a 3-day offset from spaceflight animals. Vivarium Ground Control (VGC) mice (also on a 3-day offset) were returned to 5 mice/cage and placed on standard bedding and provided water through typical sipper tubes at launch equivalent. All mice were maintained on NuRFB throughout the duration of the study. Spaceflight and HGC mice were given new food at weekly intervals. VGC mice were given new food and fresh water also on weekly intervals. An enrichment Hut, in the form of a grated shelter, was provided in the habitat. After splashdown, flight LAR mice were transferred to the animal care facility at Scripps Research Institute where they were assessed and re-caged into standard caging conditions (5 mice/cage, standard bedding and ad lib water from regular sipper tubes). LAR and ISS-T Ground Control mice were shipped from Kennedy Space Center to Scripps and housed under the same conditions as the flight mice. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n\nOnly LAR spaceflight and habitat ground control group samples were processed for scRNAseq in this dataset.     Live Animal Return (LAR): Mice were anesthetized with gas anesthesia and euthanized by means of cardiac puncture blood draw (exsanguination) and double thoracotomy. All groups (baseline, flight, habitat and vivarium ground controls) were treated identically.\n\nAfter receiving tissues from ISS team, the spleen tissue was passed through a 70ul strainer (Corning, # 10054-456) in to a 50mL tube. 5mL of RBC buffer (BioLegend, cat# 420301) was added into the tube and it was incubated at RT for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, 7mL of PBS (Lonza, cat# 17-512Q) was added into the tube and the sample was centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed carefully, avoiding the cell pellet and discarded. The pellet was resuspended with 1mL of FBS (Avantor, cat# 1300-500H lot# 023B19) and transferred to a cryovial. 1mL of 20% DMSO(VWR, cat# VWRV0231-500ML) in FBS was added dropwise into the cell suspension. Cryovials were put in Mr. Frosty (Nalgene, cat# C1562-1EA) filled with 250uL of 100% isopropanol for slow freezing. Day after cell isolation, vials were transferred from Mr. Frosty in to -80C storage box.     On the day of the library preparation, sample tubes were thawed by submerging the tubes in to 37C water bath for approximately 1 minute, until a small ice crystal remains. Cryotubes were transferred into a cell culture hood. Using a large bore pipette tips, cell suspension was collected and dropwise added in to 15mL tube containing 10mL of 37C RPMI media (Sigma, cat# R8758-1L), with 10% FBS (Gibco ref# 16000-044). The tubes were gently tilted side to side for 10-20 times and then incubated at room temperature for 1 minute. Cell suspension was centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes and the liquid was removed and discarded. Cell pellet was re-suspended in 2.5mL of fresh media and a cell count was performed using TC20 cell counter (BioRad, cat#1450102) . The tube was centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes. Supernatant was carefully removed and discarded and 2.5mL of 0.04% BSA (Sigma ref# A9418-10G) in PBS (HyClone ref# SH30028.03) was added on to the cell pellet dropwise. Cell pellet was carefully re-suspended, and another cell count was performed. Tubes were centrifuged once more at 300g for 5 minutes. After the centrifugation, the supernatant is carefully removed and discarded and the cell pellet was re-suspended in appropriate volume of 0.04% BSA in PBS, aiming for 800-1000 cells per uL at 60-80% viability. Cell count was performed. The cell suspension was passed through a Flowmi tip filter at 40um porosity (Bel-Art, cat # H13680-0040) and another count is performed to confirm cell density. Cell suspension tubes were placed on ice and immediately processed following 10X library preparation procedure.      10X Genomics procedure for library preparation was followed (10X Genomics, Single Cell 3' v3 Gene Expression kit cat#1000075, 1000074, 120262).

          "Study Protocol Description": "All mice (C57BL/6NTac) were sourced from Taconic Biosciences (Germantown, NY). Mice were weighed, chipped with BMDS RFID chip (IMI-500) and shipped to NASA KSC for delivery at approximately L-5 weeks. Mice were housed and maintained in the Animal Care Facility (ACF) at NASA KSC with 12:12 light cycle matched in timing to the light cycle used for Transporters and Habitats programmed for flight. All mice were housed in cages of 5 mice/cage with the same littermates as they had been raised. Mice were initially given ad lib standard lab chow and water, which was changed on a schedule of 2x per week. Mice were housed initially on standard bedding and provided igloo-type enrichment. Animal health was checked daily by appropriately trained NASA personnel and contracted lab technicians. At L-4 weeks, mice were placed on raised mesh flooring to simulate spaceflight Transporter and Habitat cage conditions, given water delivered through lixits identical to those used in the flight hardware and put on the NASA Nutrient-Upgraded Rodent Foodbars (NuRFB). Food and water were changed weekly, and mice were weighed bi-weekly. Igloo-type enrichment was provided in all cages. At L-12 days, mice were grouped (10 mice per cage) in larger cages for social acclimation prior to launch. Groupings were done based on age of animals and in a manner to establish similar average weights between any given grouping. At L-2 days, baseline, spaceflight and ground control groups were identified. At L-1 day, spaceflight animals were loaded into spaceflight Transporters. Habitat Ground Control (HGC) mice were loaded into Transporters on a 3-day offset from spaceflight animals. Vivarium Ground Control (VGC) mice (also on a 3-day offset) were returned to 5 mice/cage and placed on standard bedding and provided water through typical sipper tubes at launch equivalent. All mice were maintained on NuRFB throughout the duration of the study. Spaceflight and HGC mice were given new food at weekly intervals. VGC mice were given new food and fresh water also on weekly intervals. An enrichment Hut, in the form of a grated shelter, was provided in the habitat. After splashdown, flight LAR mice were transferred to the animal care facility at Scripps Research Institute where they were assessed and re-caged into standard caging conditions (5 mice/cage, standard bedding and ad lib water from regular sipper tubes).  LAR and ISS-T Ground Control mice were shipped from Kennedy Space Center to Scripps and housed under the same conditions as the flight mice. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n\nOnly LAR spaceflight and habitat ground control group samples were processed for scRNAseq in this dataset.     Live Animal Return (LAR): Mice were anesthetized with gas anesthesia and euthanized by means of cardiac puncture blood draw (exsanguination) and double thoracotomy. All groups (baseline, flight, habitat and vivarium ground controls) were treated identically.\n\nAfter dissection of the bones from the carcass by the ISS team, bone samples were transferred to our team to perform the following procedures; Bones were manually cleaned to remove all muscle and connective tissue. After cleaning, The bones were placed in a 0.5mL PCR tube and this tube was placed into larger 1mL tube pre filled with 200uL of freezing media 40% whole media (Gibco alphaMEM cat#12571-048), 50% heat inactivated FBS (Gibco cat#16000-044), 10% DMSO (Sigma, cat# A9418-10G). The tubes were centrifuged at 500g for 30 seconds until bone marrow was flushed out of the bone in to the freezing media. After centrifugation, additional 200uL of freezing media was added and the cell suspension was gently mixed by pipetting. Cryovials were put in Mr. Frosty (Nalgene, Cat#C1562-1EA) filled with 250mL of 100% isopropanol for slow freezing. Day after cell isolation, vials were transferred from Mr. Frosty in to -80C storage box.     On the day of library preparation, sample tubes were thawed in a 37C water bath for 30-90 seconds until a small ice pellet remained. After thaw the samples were handled with sterile cell culture technique as follows. The thawed samples were transferred to 4mL of fresh alphaMEM (Gibco Ref# 12571-048) supplemented with 15% FBS (Gibco Ref# 16000-044) and 1% antibiotics and gently agitated by tipping the tube and centrifuged at 500g for 5 minutes. The media supernatant removed and the cell pellet re-suspended in 4mL of 0.04% Bovine Serum Albumin (Sigma Ref# A9418-10G) in PBS (HyClone Ref# SH30028.03) and centrifuged again at previously described settings. This 0.04% BSA was process was repeated for a total of two washes. 10uL cell stock sample was collected and cells counted using TC20 cell counter (BioRad, cat#1450102) and percent live established using a 1:1 trypan blue formula. The cells were centrifuged a last time and resuspended in the appropriate volume of 0.04% BSA for 1000 cells/uL concentration at 80-99% viability. The final suspension was filtered through a 40 micron FlowMi tip filter (Bel-Art, cat# H13680-0040), counted as previously described, and visualized to ensure single cell suspension. Cell suspension tubes were placed on ice and immediately processed following 10X library preparation procedure.     10X Genomics procedure for library preparation was followed (10X Genomics, Single Cell 3' v3 Gene Expression kit cat#1000075, 1000074, 120262). Using the Chromium Controller (10X Genomics, cat#1000204), the cells were encapsulated in Gel bead-in-Emulsion, or GEMs, which are individually tagged with a one of 750,000 independent barcodes. The targeted total cells in a single cell GEM suspension was 8,000 cells for bone marrow samples and 5,000 cells for PBMC and splenocyte samples. Within the GEM cell lysis, barcode association to mRNA, and reverse transcription (RT) was conducted in a single thermal cycler run. Following reverse transcription, the GEMs were ruptured, and the barcoded cDNA was cleaned-up and amplified using traditional wet bench methodologies. Clean-up was conducted using DynaBeads MyOne Silane magnetic beads and appropriate buffers, and 12 amplification cycles were completed using the provided reagents. Post amplification clean-up was conducted using SPRI select magnetic beads (Beckman Counter, cat#B23318) and the single cell cDNA barcode tagged libraries were eluted in EB Buffer (QIAgen, cat#19086). Sequencing libraries were quantified using Qubit 4 instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat#Q33238) with Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay (Invitrogen, cat#Q33231) and library quality was assessed with TapeStation 4200 instrument (Agilent, cat#G2991BA) with D1000 DNA ScreenTape Analysis assay (Agilent, cat#5067-5583 and cat#5067-5582).     scRNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. PhiX included as control. Read 1 contains cell barcode and UMI, and Read 2 contains sequence of interest.     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2). Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.9) was used to generate the raw MultiQC report.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7111. In short, raw fastq files were trimmed, filtered, then aligned using STAR (version 2.7.10a). Mus musculus STAR reference was built using STAR (version 2.7.10a), Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf. Reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) using the STARsolo options described in step 3a of GL-DPPD-7111, and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Gene counts, pre-mRNA counts, annotated and novel splice junctions, and spliced, unspliced and ambiguous counts per cell were calculated and reported.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.",

To directly assess spaceflight effects, half of the young and old mice (10 old, 10 young) were sacrificed on-orbit after 55-58 days (ISS Terminal, ISS-T), while the other half (10 old, 10 young) were returned live to Earth after 32 days and allowed to recover for 24 days (Live Animal Return, LAR) before sacrifice. ISS-T and LAR mice were the same age at sacrifice. Both the ISS-T and LAR animals had independent ground controls (10 mice per group housed in flight hardware in matched environmental conditions), basal controls (10 mice per group sacrificed 2 days before launch), and vivarium controls (10 mice per group housed within standard vivarium habitats). Thus RRRM-2 included a total of 160 mice.

          "Study Protocol Description": "Frozen callus segments (or equivalent femora sections of sham mice) were cryogenically grounded using Cryomill (Retsh GmbH, Germany) and the amorphous materials were divided into two portions; one for transcriptomic and the other for metabolomic assays. TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, MA) was added to the portions marked for transcriptomic assays and the specimens were homogenized using a Precellys Evolution Homogenizer and Cryolys Evolution (Bertin Technologies SAS, France). Invitrogen TRIzol RNA extraction methods and the miRNeasy mini kit total RNA purification procedures (QIAGEN Inc., Germantown, MD) were followed to extract the mRNA. The quantity and quality of RNA was then determined using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, Wilmington, DE) and the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilient Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA), respectively. The purified RNA samples were stored at −80 C for future use.     Briefly, purified RNA was labeled with Cy-5 dyes. The reference RNA (Agilent, CA) was labeled with Cy-3 dyes.     The samples were hybridized and incubated for 17 h at 55 C. After overnight incubation, the slides underwent a series of washes.     The slides were imaged using an Agilent DNA microarray scanner and the features were extracted using the default settings of the manufacturer software (Feature Extraction software v.10.7, Agilent, CA).     All experiments were performed in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and followed experimental protocols approved by the NASA Animal Care and Use Committees, #FLT-15-101/NAS-15-105 and Animal Care and Use Review Office (ACURO) of U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC).  Seven-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). The mice were cage-mated from weaning in N40 mouse cages in groups of 15 mice (Ancare, Bellmore, NY). The mice were then acclimated to their new environment and experimental housing conditions as previously described. Briefly, mice were housed in a 12-hour light/dark cycle condition and at temperature of 24–25 C. The mice were placed in N40 cages with a raised wire floor (3 openings/inch, Ancare), fed NASA Nutrient-upgraded Rodent Food Bar (NuRFB), and provided modified lixit water bottles to simulate spaceflight-like hardware/food. Mice were ear punched for identification and weighed biweekly to evaluate their adaptation to the special water lixit and NuRFB.  Four days prior to launch, after an acclimation period of 10 days, the mouse cages were randomized into 4 groups: 1) Sham surgery on Ground (G-Sham); 2) Sham surgery housed in Spaceflight (FLT-Sham); 3) SBD surgery on Ground (G-Surgery); and 4) SBD surgery housed in Spaceflight (FLT-Surgery). The surgical procedure was carried out as previously described. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with Ketamine-Xylazine (125–20 mg/kg), and the right hindleg was shaved from 1 cm distal to the knee joint to midline. The leg was then prepped with ethanol and Betadine three times each in an alternating fashion to ensure limb sterility. After the anesthetic plane was confirmed, a one cm incision was then made over the right femoral midshaft extending to the knee joint. The knee was flexed, and a 27-gauge hypodermic needle was inserted into the distal end of the femur and passed in a retrograde fashion into the intramedullary canal. A sterile Dremel rotary cutting tool (Dremel Inc. Racine, WI) was then used to remove a 2 mm segment from the midpoint of the femoral diaphysis. Next, a previously characterized, custom made, 2 mm poly(propylene fumarte)/tricalcium phosphate graft was inserted at the defect site to maintain defect size. The previously placed needle was advanced through the graft and proximal femoral intramedullary canal through the greater trochanter. The needle tip was then bent back on itself and the needle pulled anterograde to stabilize and align the femoral defect. The needle was then cut at the distal end of the femur and a saline-soaked collagen sponge (RCM6 Resorbable Collagen Membrane, ACE, Brockton, MA) was wrapped around the scaffold and sutured into place. The muscle was closed with simple Vicryl suture and the skin was closed using wound clips (7 mm, Braintree Scientific, Braintree, MA). Once the mice recovered from anesthesia, they were provided with buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) for analgesia, and then were returned to their original cages with K3392 Rest Stops (Bio-Serve, Flemington, NJ) for the first 2 days to assist with recovery. Of note, surgical complications were observed in less than 5% of the mice. After the 2-day recovery period, the 10 healthiest mice per group (as determined by NASA veterinarians in collaboration with authors MAK and PJC by visual inspection of surgery sites, the overall activity levels, and condition of the mice) were transferred into spaceflight housing 2 days prior to launch. The FLT-Sham and FLT-Surgery mice were housed in NASA Rodent Transporters while in the SpaceX Dragon capsule, and on February 19, 2017, these mice were launched into space via Space X-10 vehicle operated under commercial resupply services (CRS)-10 mission. After 5 days, they were moved to International Space Station’s (ISS) NASA rodent research Habitat. It should be noted that upon transfer of mice to the Habitat hardware on the ISS (and on the ground at KSC), the 10 group-housed Sham or Surgery mice were randomly subdivided into 2 groups of 5 mice because the Habitat holds a maximum of 5 mice per side (2 sides/Habitat). The G-Sham and G-Surgery cohorts were housed in identical spaceflight hardware and treated as identically as possible; 5 days asynchronous to spaceflight cohorts in order to best simulate spaceflight conditions. Importantly, weekly orders of mice were delivered from Jackson Laboratories to ensure properly aged mice for possible delays in launch. Therefore asynchronous ground controls were ∼2 days younger in age than flight mice, which is negligible in terms of bone status/growth in 9- and 13- week-old mice (the approximate age and the time of surgery and euthanasia).     Mice were euthanized at 24-28 days post-launch when mice were approximately 13  weeks of age. The extended time range was due to the significant time it takes to accomplish tasks in spaceflight. For these studies, the astronauts were able to euthanize and collect samples from a maximum of 8 mice per day. Euthanasia was performed by injection of ketamine/xylazine (150/45 mg/kg) followed by closed chest cardiac puncture with blood withdrawal and cervical dislocation. Each group of 10 mice was subdivided into two groups of 5 mice. For 5 mice/group, the right hindlimb was removed at the hip and stored in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) at 4 C until they were returned to Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) approximately 2 weeks after euthanasia. After arrival at IUSM, the right hindlimb samples were washed with ice cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), transferred to ice cold 70% ethanol and stored at 4 C until being imaged by micro-computed tomography (µCT). The remaining mouse carcass was stored in aluminum foil in NASA's cold stowage, which is at or below −80 C on the ISS until transfer back to cold storage on Earth at −80 C. For the other one-half of mice in each group, the whole carcass was left intact and stored in aluminum foil at or below −80 C. The carcasses remained at −80 C or lower until they arrived at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (erstwhile, US Army Center for Environmental Health Research or USACEHR) at Fort Detrick, MD approximately 2 weeks after euthanasia. Following a well-practiced protocol, the mice were then partially thawed and tissue dissection for each carcass was completed in approximately 45 min. After dissection, individual tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 C until processing.  Most relevant to the present study, the proximal and distal 2 mm of the femur of surgery mice (both FLT and G) were removed and the remainder of the midshaft was considered the callus regions. The same region of the sham femurs (both FLT and G) were saved as controls. Therefore, there were a maximum 5 mice/group allotted for both uCT analyses and multi-omics assays.",

          "Study Description": "Adverse effects of spaceflight on musculoskeletal health increase the risk of bone injury and impairment of fracture healing. Its yet elusive molecular comprehension warrants immediate attention, since space travel is becoming more frequent. Here we examined the effects of spaceflight on bone fracture healing using a 2 mm femoral segmental bone defect (SBD) model. Forty, 9-week-old, male C57BL/6J mice were randomized into 4 groups: 1) Sham surgery on Ground (G-Sham); 2) Sham surgery housed in Spaceflight (FLT-Sham); 3) SBD surgery on Ground (G-Surgery); and 4) SBD surgery housed in Spaceflight (FLT-Surgery). Surgery procedures occurred 4 days prior to launch; post-launch, the spaceflight mice were house in the rodent habitats on the International Space Station (ISS) for approximately 4 weeks before euthanasia. Mice remaining on the Earth were subjected to identical housing and experimental conditions. The right femur from half of the spaceflight and ground groups was investigated by micro-computed tomography (µCT). In the remaining mice, the callus regions from surgery groups and corresponding femoral segments in sham mice were probed by global transcriptomic and metabolomic assays. µCT confirmed escalated bone loss in FLT-Sham compared to G-Sham mice. Comparing to their respective on-ground counterparts, the morbidity gene-network signal was inhibited in sham spaceflight mice but activated in the spaceflight callus. µCT analyses of spaceflight callus revealed increased trabecular spacing and decreased trabecular connectivity. Activated apoptotic signals in spaceflight callus were synchronized with inhibited cell migration signals that potentially hindered the wound site to recruit growth factors. A major pro-apoptotic and anti-migration gene network, namely the RANK-NFκB axis, emerged as the central node in spaceflight callus. Concluding, spaceflight suppressed a unique biomolecular mechanism in callus tissue to facilitate a failed regeneration, which merits a customized intervention strategy.

          "Study Protocol Description": "The 16-week-old female C57 BL/6J mice (Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME) were used in this study as part of the NASA RR-1 project consortium. This project was approved by the NASA Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Both spaceflight and ground control animals were housed in NASA’s animal enclosure modules (AEM), with control mice being exposed to the same environment conditions (12-hour light cycle, temperature and humidity) as those flown on the International Space Station (ISS). Control animals were kept inside an environmental simulator (ISSES) at the Space Life Science Laboratory (SLSL) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), and the spaceflight animals were transported to the ISS by SpaceX4 on September 21, 2014. All animals were fed with a special NASA food bar diet and their health was checked daily. The spaceflight mice were euthanized and frozen on-orbit after 37 days of flight, while ground control mice were simultaneously euthanized and frozen under identical conditions.     After the frozen carcasses were returned to KSC, the ocular tissues were removed from both groups. At the time of dissections, both eyes were dissected from the carcasses thawed at room temperature for 15 - 20 minutes. The eyes were harvested and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored at −80C. The frozen whole eye samples were micro-dissected in the ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Fine spring scissors were used to separate the cornea from the sclera to access the retina. The retina was carefully detached from the sclera. The retina, cornea, and lens were immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at −80C before DNA and RNA isolations.     Retinal tissues (4 -20 mg) were homogenized with Precellys CKM beads (Hilden, Germany) in 350 ul of Qiagen RLT plus buffer. The genomic DNA (gDNA) and total RNA were isolated using the Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. After isolation, RNA and DNA were frozen and kept at -80 C until further use. Isolated RNA samples were quantified using NanoDrop spectrophotometry (Thermo Scientific, Chino, CA). DNA and RNA were further quantified using the Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Kit and RNA Broad Range Kit, respectively (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). RNA quality was evaluated using the Agilent 2200 TapeStation and RNA ScreenTape (Santa Clara, CA). All RNA samples had an integrity numbers (RIN) ranging from 7.2 to 8.1.     The OvationR Mouse RNA-Seq System 1 - 16 (NuGEN Technologies, San Carlos, CA) was used to construct RNA-seq libraries according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 100 ng of total RNA spiked with 1 ul of 1:500 diluted ERCC Mix 1 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) was used to start cDNA synthesis. Following the primer annealing and cDNA synthesis, the products (130 ul/each sample) were sheared using Covaris S220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA). The parameters were set as follows: 10% duty factor, peak power 175 and 200 cycles per burst at 4 C for 200 seconds to obtain fragment sizes between 150 - 200 bp. The products were then subject to end-repair, adaptor index ligation and strand selection. A custom InDA-C primer mixture SS5 Version 5 for mouse was used to allow strand selection. Finally, the libraries were amplified on a PCR thermocycler for 17 cycles (MastercyclerR pro, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), and purified with RNAClean XP Agencourt beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN); and quantified using Qubit dsDNA HS Kit on Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The quality and peak size were determined using the D1000 ScreenTape on Agilent 2200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).\n\nOne hundred (100) ng of gDNA was used to construct RRBS DNA-seq library using the OvationR RRBS Methyl-Seq System (NuGEN Technologies, San Carlos, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the MspI enzyme, which cuts the DNA at CCGG sites, was used to digest gDNA into fragments. The fragments were directly subject to end blunting and phosphorylation in preparation for ligation to a methylated adapter with a single-base T overhang. A unique index, out of 16 indices, was used for each individual sample for multiplexing. The ligation products were repaired in a thermal cycler under the program (60 C -10 min, 70 C -10 min, hold at 4 C). The products of the final repair reaction were used for bisulfite conversion using QIAGEN EpiTect Fast DNA Bisulfite Kit according to Qiagen's protocol. Bisulfiteconverted DNA was then amplified (MastercyclerR pro, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), and bead-purified with Agencourt RNAClean XP beads.     The RRBS libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550, 75 bp, single-end read, whereas the RNAseq libraries were sequenced on both Illumina NextSeq 550 and HiSeq 4000, pair-end reads (75 bpx2), at the Loma Linda University (LLU) Center for Genomics.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.3 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.3/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. The data were normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor*. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0). Assessment relevant to ERCC Mix 1 regarding ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis.html report.\n\n*ERCC-normalized data are available upon request.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "All the animal procedures were performed according to the guidelines of the Chancellor’s Animal Research Committee at UCLA (Protocol 2009-127) and NASA Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Twenty 32-week-old female BALB/c mice (Taconic Biosciences, NY) were used in this study. All mice were housed at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for 4 weeks before rocket launch and were randomly divided into ground control group and flight groups (n of 10 per group). On June 3rd, 2017, mice of in the flight group were transported to the International Space Station (ISS) as part of SpaceX CRS-11 and kept at ISS for the full 9 weeks of experimentation, while mice of ground control group were kept at KSC for the same duration. The mice housed at KSC were in the NASA’s Rodent Research Hardware System and were fed food bar diet ad libitum. The food bar essentially has added moisture in the standard rodent chow to form a bar form and prevent it from floating in microgravity. An enrichment Hut, in the form of a grated shelter, was provided in the habitat. At the end of the study, all mice were euthanized at ISS (spaceflight group) or KSC (ground control group) by our NASA partners on site. Mice were then were deeply frozen in situ under −80C or colder until later transportation to UCLA on dry ice.     Frozen carcasses were thawed on wet ice before tissue dissection. Mice skeletal muscles were dissected separately and either fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin or preserved in RNAlater solution.     Total RNA was isolated from mouse gastrocnemius (n of 3) and quadriceps (n of 3) of each experimental group (flight and ground control) using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction followed by silica-membrane purification. Briefly, frozen tissue samples were minced into small pieces (1mm x 1mm x 1mm). A homogeneous lysate was achieved by adding lysing buffer and gentle ultrasound vibration on ice. Tissue lysate was centrifuged and the supernatant was used for RNA phenol/chloroform extraction. After phase separation, the aqueous layer was transferred and mixed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol. Total RNA was then extracted using Rneasy spin columns from the Rneasy micro Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.     RNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using standard Illumina protocols.     For each replicate RNA sample, a cDNA library was prepared and sequenced by the UCLA Technology Center for Genomics and Bioinformatics using an Illumina sequencer, generating an average of 41.5 million single-end 50bp reads.     The raw fastq file for each sample was assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate raw MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.0 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.0/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.5) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0) to generate the RSEM raw counts data. A set of rRNA-removed raw counts data was also created by removing Ensembl IDs that map to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) from the RSEM gene count data.",

          "Study Description": "We sought to comprehensively elucidate the transcriptomic underpinnings of microgravity-induced muscle phenotypes in mice by evaluating both differential gene expression (DGE) and changes in alternative splicing (AS) due to extended spaceflight. Total RNA was isolated from the gastrocnemius and quadriceps, postural and phasic muscles of the hind limb, respectively, of 32-week-old female BALB/c mice exposed to microgravity or ground control conditions for nine weeks. RNA sequencing revealed that DGE and AS varied across postural and phasic muscle types with preferential employment of DGE in the gastrocnemius and AS in the quadriceps. Gene ontology analysis indicated that DGE and AS regulate distinct molecular processes. Various non-differentially expressed transcripts encoding musculoskeletal proteins (Tnnt3, Tnnt1, Neb, Ryr1, and Ttn) and muscle-specific RNA binding splicing regulators (Mbnl1 and Rbfox1) were found to have significant changes in AS that altered critical functional domains of their protein products. In striking contrast, microgravity-induced differentially expressed genes were associated with translation/ribosomal function and lipid metabolism. Our work serves as the first comprehensive investigation of coordinate changes in DGE and AS in large limb muscles across spaceflight. We propose that substantial remodeling of pre-mRNA by AS is a major component of transcriptomic adaptation of skeletal muscle to microgravity. The alternatively spliced genes identified here could be targeted by small molecule splicing regulator therapies to address microgravity-induced changes in muscle during spaceflight.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "All mice (BALB/cAnNTac) were sourced from Taconic Biosciences (Germantown, NY).  Mice were weighed, chipped with BMDS RFID chip (IMI-500) and shipped to NASA KSC for delivery at approximately L-4 weeks.  Mice were housed and maintained in the Animal Care Facility (ACF) at NASA KSC with 12:12 light cycle matched in timing to the light cycle used for Transporters and Habitats programmed for flight.  All mice were housed in cages of 5 mice/cage with the same littermates as they had been raised.  Mice were initially given ad lib standard lab chow and water, which was changed on a schedule of 2x per week.  Mice were housed initially on standard bedding and provided igloo-type enrichment.  Animal health was checked daily by appropriately trained NASA personnel and contracted lab technicians.  At L-3 weeks, mice were placed on raised mesh flooring to simulate spaceflight Transporter and Habitat cage conditions, given water delivered through lixits identical to those used in the flight hardware and put on the NASA Nutrient-Upgraded Rodent Foodbars (NuRFB).  Food and water was changed weekly and mice were weighed bi-weekly.  Igloo-type enrichment was provided in all cages.  At L-10 days, mice were grouped (10 mice per cage) in larger cages for social acclimation prior to launch.  Groupings were done based on age of animals and with regard to establishing similar average weights between any given grouping.  At L-2 days, baseline, spaceflight and ground control groups were identified.  At L-1 day, spaceflight animals were loaded into spaceflight Transporters.  Habitat Ground Control (HGC) mice were loaded into Transporters on a 3-day offset from spaceflight animals.  Vivarium Ground Control (VGC) mice (also on a 3-day offset) were returned to 5 mice/cage and placed on standard bedding and provided water through typical sipper tubes at launch equivalent.  All mice were maintained on NuRFB throughout the duration of the study.  Spaceflight and HGC mice were given new food at weekly intervals.  VGC mice were given new food and fresh water also on weekly intervals.  Mold contamination of food: Spaceflight and Habitat Ground Control mice were exposed to mold in their food to unknown relative degrees. The Vivarium Control and Baseline Control mice had clean food throughout their habitation.  Loose food bars: Food bars came loose and fell to the bottom of the cage for the HGC mice and was free floating for the Spaceflight mice.  This did not prevent the mice from eating. This may have caused some degree of stress for these animals that would have been experienced differently between the Spaceflight and HGC groups.  Live animal return: Because weather in the Pacific was very poor, mice experienced double density housing (10 per cage instead of 5) for at least 7 days instead of the expected 2-3 days. Habitat Ground Control mice were treated the same way but this duration of double-density housing probably created additional stress on both groups of mice. In addition, because of rough seas, the Spaceflight mice might have experienced some sea sickness-type conditions that would not have been experienced by the HGC mice.     Live Animal Return (LAR) liver samples: Mice were anesthetized with gas anesthesia and euthanized by means of cardiac puncture blood draw (exsanguination) and double thoracotomy.  The liver was removed, weighed, dissected into individual lobes (1- left/right medial, 2- left lateral and 3- remaining lobes) and snap frozen on liquid nitrogen.  Tissues were frozen within 10-16 minutes of thoracotomy procedure.  All groups (baseline, flight, habitat and vivarium ground controls) were treated identically.  Liver samples were maintained at -80C or lower temperatures throughout the storage during transportation and shipment.   ISS Terminal (ISS-T) liver samples: Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and euthanized by means of cardiac puncture blood draw (exsanguination) and double thoracotomy.  The spleen was dissected fresh from each carcass and placed in a tube containing RNA Later.  The carcass was then wrapped in foil and frozen in MELFI on board the ISS or in ground -80C freezers.  Carcasses were maintained at -80C or lower temperatures throughout the storage on board the ISS, in ground freezers and during transportation and shipment.  For liver dissection, carcasses were thawed at room temperature one at a time (staggered) until the tissues were sufficiently pliable for dissection (approximately 60-90 minutes).  Once thawed, the liver was removed from each carcass, weighed, dissected into individual lobes (1- left/right medial, 2- left lateral and 3- remaining lobes) and snap frozen on liquid nitrogen.  Liver samples were maintained at -80C or lower temperatures throughout the storage in ground freezers and during transportation and shipment.     RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Homogenization buffer for DNA and RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use.  Approximately 20-30 mg of tissue was isolated using a scalpel, weighed and immediately placed in 700 uL of the Buffer RLT solution without thawing the tissue. Homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix (Zirconium 2.0mm RINO Lysis, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 5 minutes at 4C.  Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer protocol.  RNA was eluted in 50 uL RNAse free H2O, and DNA was eluted in 50 uL EB buffer. Concentration for all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR kit.  RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) or the Agilent RNA ScreenTape Assay (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA Cat # 4456739, v92) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol. Mix1 was used for ISS-T FLT, ISS-T BSL, LAR VIV, and LAR GC. Mix 2 was used for ISS-T GC, ISS-T VIV, LAR FLT, and LAR BSL.     RNA ribo depletion was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold. Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN greater than 4. Index adapters were 1.5 uM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size ~340 bp was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scentific, Waltham, MA). Library quality control was determined by iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Paired end 149bp. PhiX included as control.     UMIs were extracted from fastq files using UMI-tools (version 1.1.1). Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.2 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.2/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0), ERCC genes were removed, and the non-ERCC genes were normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis_GLbulkRNAseq.html report.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "All materials were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA) unless otherwise noted. The murine osteocytic cell line, Ocy454 was used in this experiment. The cell line was derived from double-transgenic immortalized mice (Immortomouse, Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA) expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the dentin matrix protein 1 (Dmp1) promoter and a thermolabile simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen under the H-2Kb promoter, which is active at 33C (permissive temperature) and inactive at 37C (semi-permissive temperature). Ocy454 cells were grown at 33C with 5% CO2 on rat type I collagen-coated flasks (BioCoat, Corning, NY, USA) in the growth medium (minimum essential medium α supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic- antimycotic). Upon reaching 80% confluence, cells were trypsinized with TrypLE Express and seeded on highly porous 200 μm-thick polystyrene 3D scaffolds (Alvetex 6-well insert, ~18 mm diameter) (Reprocell, Sedgefield, Co. Durham, UK) at a density of 1.6 × 10^6 cells/scaffold. The scaffolds were cultured in the growth medium for 3 days at 33C with 5% CO2, and then fed with fresh growth medium and incubated for an additional 2 days under 37C with 5% CO2 to initiate the osteocytic differentiation. Three days prior to launch (−3 d) the cell-containing scaffolds were punched to a diameter of 9 mm with trephine blades (Bausch & Lomb Storz, Bridgewater, NJ, USA), and five 9 mm scaffolds were randomly housed in a flight-certified bioreactor (described below). The bioreactors were then integrated into fluid flight-certified pathways followed by feeding with 5 mL of fresh growth medium and overnight incubation under 37C with 5% CO2.\n\nThe details about the flight-certified cell culture hardware, eOSTEO (enhanced Osteoporosis Experiments on Orbit), were previously described. Briefly, eOSTEO, originally designed by Canadian Space Agency (CSA), is a fully automated cell culture system developed by CALM Technologies (Kingston, ON, Canada) and successfully flown in previous spaceflight missions including OSTEO-3. For the OSTEO-4 mission, the eOSTEO payload was further modified by CALM Technologies to meet the requirements onboard the ISS. The modified payload, OSTEO-4, was composed of three layers of independent cell culture trays and each tray housed three removable bioreactors that were connected to any of five 60 mL syringe reservoirs via a silicone tube fluid pathway. The OSTEO-4 payload operates a closed system that does not allow for the free exchange of oxygen and CO2, hence three of the five syringes were filled with the growth medium supplemented with 25 mM HEPES buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to preserve the pH of the medium. Ground-based preliminary experiments demonstrated that growth medium for OSTEO-4 experiments supplemented with 25 mM HEPES buffer maintained physiological pH in the non-CO2 closed environment for up to 24 hours between 5-mL medium re-feeds without any significant effects on osteocytic gene expression. The remaining two syringes were filled with either RNA stabilizer (RNAprotect Cell Reagent, Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) or 0.99% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Acros, Fair Lawn, NJ, USA) in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS, General Electric, Logan, UT, USA). We prepared two identical OSTEO-4 payloads, one was for the spaceflight and the other served as a ground control, with the random-integration of the fluid pathways including bioreactors and five syringes into the flight or ground control cell culture trays to minimize sample bias. An additional ground control was prepared two days later, following identical protocols, and used as supplemental control samples. Forty-eight hours before launch (−2 d) the flight OSTEO-4 payload was handed over to the NASA team and launched into space on board the CRS-6 SpaceX Dragon spacecraft from Cape Canaveral, FL, on April 14th, 2015. The two identical ground control OSTEO-4 payloads were kept in the ISS chamber at Kennedy Space Center which mimiced the temperature and humidity conditions of Dragon-6 and ISS. For the entire duration of the experiment, the cell culture bioreactors were maintained at 37C and automatically fed with the HEPES-containing growth medium (5 mL per bioreactor) at 28 and 23 hours prior to launch (due to one day delay of launch) and every 24 hours after launch The bioreactors were fixed with either RNA stabilizer or 0.99% PFA in DPBS at 2, 4, or 6 days of exposure to μG conditions and were subsequently cooled down to 8-16C prior to being disconnected from the cell culture trays along with media collection bags and stored in the cold stowage (−80C) on the ISS by astronauts. The bioreactors and media samples were returned to earth maintaining cold-stowage condi- tions on the same Dragon-6 spacecraft on May 21st, 2015.     Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the bioreactors frozen and fixed with RNA stabilizer (RNAprotect Cell Reagent, Qiagen) at different time points (2, 4, or 6 days) under 1G or μG were thawed for 45-60 min- utes at room temperature. From each bioreactor, three of five 9-mm-punched 3D cell culture scaffolds (Alvetex, Reprocell) were removed and individually re-stored in fresh RNA stabilizer at −80C for later analysis. To optimize cell lysing, each of the remaining two scaffolds was cut into half and both pieces were lysed together in 1.7 mL RNase-free microcentrifuge tubes (Denville Scientific, Holliston, MA, USA) containing 650 μL of Buffer RLT Plus (RNeasy Plus Mini Kit, Qiagen) supplemented with 1% β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich) by agitating at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes at room temperature with a thermal mixer (Thermal Mixer II, Fisher Scientific). The lysed cell samples and the remaining scaffolds were then transferred in QIAshredder spin columns (Qiagen) and centrifuged at 16 100× g for 3 minutes at room temperature for homog- enization. The homogenized samples were further processed with a genomic DNA elimination step by following the Qiagen's RNA isolation protocol. Isolated total RNA both from spaceflight and ground control samples were high qual- ity and integrity, as determined by the 28S/18S rRNA peak and area ratios (ranges 1.8-2.1 and 1.9-2.5, respectively) and the RNA integrity number (RIN, range 8.2-8.7) using RNA 6000 Pico Assay RNA chips run in Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The RNA sam- ples were stored at −80C until further analysis.     Briefly, total RNA (100 ng) was reverse- transcribed using GeneChip WT Plus Reagent Kit. The obtained double-stranded cDNA was used as a template for in vitro transcription (IVT) resulting in antisense cRNA which was purified using Purification Beads and used as a template for reverse transcription to produce single-stranded DNA in the sense orientation. During this step 2′-deoxyuridine-5′-triphosphate (dUTP) was incorporated. The DNA was then fragmented using uracil DNA glyco- sylase (UDG) and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE 1) and labeled with DNA Labeling Reagent that is covalently linked to biotin using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). IVT and cDNA fragmentation quality controls were carried out by running an mRNA Pico assay in the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.     The labeled fragmented DNA was hybridized to the Mouse Transcriptome Arrays 1.0 for 16-18 hours in GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 at 45°C with rotation at 60 rpm. The hybridized samples were washed and stained using Affymetrix fluidics station 450. The first stain with streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin (SAPE) was followed by signal amplification using a biotinylated goat anti-streptavidin antibody and another SAPE staining (Hybridization, Washing and Staining Kit).     GeneChip Microarrays were immediately scanned using Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner 3000 7G Plus.     Mouse Transcriptome Array CEL files were normalized to produce probeset-level expression values using the implementation of the Robust Multiarray Average (RMA) in the Affymetrix Expression Console software package. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed using the prcomp R function with expression values that had been normalized across all samples to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.     Analyses of variance were performed using the f.pvalue function in the sva package (version 3.4.0). Pairwise differential expression was assessed using by performing Student's t test on the co- efficients of linear models created using the lmFit function in the limma package (version 3.14.4). Correction for multiple hypothesis testing was accomplished using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR). All microarray analyses were performed using the R environment for statistical computing (version 2.15.1).",

          "Study Description": "Bone loss is one of the major health problems for astronauts during long-term spaceflight and for patients during prolonged bed rest or paralysis. Growing evidence suggests that osteocytes, the most abundant cells in the mineralized bone matrix, play a key role in sensing mechanical forces applied to the skeleton and in transducing them into subcellular biochemical signals to modulate bone homeostasis. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying both mechanosensation and mechanotransduction in osteocytes under the real microgravity (µG) condition are poorly understood. To unravel the mechanisms by which osteocyte, sense and responds to mechanical unloading, we exposed murine osteocytic cell line, Ocy454, seeded on a highly porous polystyrene 3D scaffold, to 2, 4, or 6 days of µG on board the International Space Station (ISS) and compared their gene expression with cells at 1G on Earth. Bioinformatics analysis of cells exposed to µG revealed several pathways differentially regulated upon exposure to microgravity.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "RNA/DNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) following simultaneous purification of genomic DNA and Total RNA from animal Tissues protocol: RLT buffer with 1% beta-mercaptoethanol was added to each tube containing tissue sections. Homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing beads in FastPrep instrument for 3s. Samples were centrifuged for 3 minutes at RT at maximum speed. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 30 ul of RNAse free H2O, and DNA was eluted in 50 ul RNAse free H2O. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA ribo depletion and library preparation was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Input RNA ranged between 46ng and 120ng with RIN greater than 6. Index adapters used were at 1.5 ÂµM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit. Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scentific, Waltham, MA) following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as following: Read 1: 151bp, Index1: 17bp, Index2: 8bp Read 2: 151bp. PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     UMIs were extracted from fastq files using UMI-tools (version 1.1.2). Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), distance between forward and reverse reads using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data was imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.22.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).     A cohort of 12-week-old female BALB/c mice were flown to the ISS and housed in the Rodent Habitat and were subjected to microgravity for 39-42 days. Mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. Mice from the same cohort were dissected at time of launch and used as basal controls. One treatment injection was given prior to launch and the other two treatment injections were given during the mission with around 14 days apart. At the time of injection, Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scan was also performed while the animals were anesthetized by ketamine/xylazine. At the end of the mission, spaceflight and ground controls had blood collected, were euthanized and one hindlimb removed and whole carcasses were stored at -80 C until BSP (Biospecimen Sharing Program) dissection on earth. [Spaceflight and ground control mice- untreated, injected with control Ig-G (sham treated).] The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     Mouse carcasses were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes for dissection. Each carcass dissection time was no longer than 1 hour from collection of the first tissue. Multiple tissues, including the heart tissue, were collected from each carcass. Heart tissues were harvested and snap frozen in LN2, then stored in -80 C freezer for sample processing. Brain tissue from spaceflight and ground control groups were shipped on dry ice to SciLifeLab Stockholm, KTH Royal Institute of Technology for processing.     Cryosectioning were performed at by SciLifeLab following 10X Genomics Visium protocol. https://www.10xgenomics.com/spatial-transcriptomics/ Visium is a commercially available kit produced by 10x Genomics, which allows to spatially visualize the gene expression of tissue sections. Brain samples from three flight and three ground control animal groups were cut in half between hemispheres. One hemisphere of each brain was intended for generating Spatial Transcriptomics libraries, whereas the other hemispheres will be used for generating single nuclei RNA-seq data. Hemispheres from three flight and one ground control group were cryosectioned, where 2 consecutive sections from hippocampus area of each brain were placed on Visium Gene Expression arrays. Sectioning of brain tissues for bulk-RNAseq was performed simultaneously with sectioning for the Visium spatial gene expression protocol. 10-20 sections from each sample collected from various areas of the brain were placed into eppendorf tubes for RNA/DNA extraction and stored at -80 degrees freezer until processing.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample--ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was 'living', including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.     Sample prep were performed at by SciLifeLab following 10X Genomics Visium protocol. https://www.10xgenomics.com/spatial-transcriptomics/  On the Visium Gene Expression array, the tissue is fixed, stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin and imaged. Imaging step is followed by tissue permeabilization in order to release mRNA from each section. The mRNA molecules are captured by barcoded probes in their spatial location of the array surface. Subsequently, synthesis of cDNA is performed.     Sequencing library constructions were performed by SciLifeLab following 10X Genomics Visium protocol. (https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression)     The eight libraries prepared from the sources CF1, CF2, CF7 and CG7 are sequenced at the GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Paired end: read 1 at 29 bp and read 2 at 121 bp. PhiX included as control. The 4 libraries prepared from the sources CG8 and CG9 are sequenced at SciLifeLab on Illumina NextSeq500. Paired end: read 1 at 28 bp and read 2 at 150 bp.     Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of Mus-musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.     The tissue slices were fixed and stained following the 10x genomics protocol: CG000160 Rev C.     The visium spatial gene expression slide was imaged following the 10x genomics guidelines: CG000241, Rev D.     The processed data contains the following: Counts data for each brain tissue section including corresponding spot coordinates and images processed by Spaceranger; final object containing the deconvolution results processed using Stereoscope; final analysed objects, corresponding metadata file and final rmarkdown html document showing the final plots from the multiomics analysis; and final analysed seurat object with ST clusters and corresponding annotations. The code for the complete analysis pipeline is provided under the github repository: https://github.com/giacomellolab/NASA_RR3_Brain.     Nuclei were isolated following 10x Genomics Nuclei Isolation from Complex Tissues for Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Sequencing (CG000375, Rev C).     Libraries were prepared according to manufacturer protocol (10x Genomics user guide CG000338 Rev F, cDNA amplification + gene expression library construction).     Finished Gene Expression libraries were sequenced by using an Illumina NextSeq2000 platform with lengths of read 1 and read 2, 28 bp and 150 bp long respectively.     Processing of raw data files was done using Cellranger Arc 2.0.0. Count matrices/fragment files were generated using the 'cellranger-arc count' and then merged into aggregated files using 'cellranger-arc aggr'. The aggregated counts/fragment files were finally used for the data analysis and are provided along with the raw data. The code for the complete analysis pipeline is provided under the github repository: https://github.com/giacomellolab/NASA_RR3_Brain.     Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of Mus-musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.

Twenty BALB/c, 12-weeks old female mice (ten controls and ten treated) were flown to the ISS and housed in the Rodent Habitat for 39-42 days. Twenty mice of similar age, and matching sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. Basal controls were housed in standard vivarium cages. Spaceflight, ground controls and basal groups had blood collected, then were euthanized, had one hind limb removed, and finally whole carcasses were stored at -80 C until dissection. All mice in this data set received only the control/sham injection. Brain samples from three flight and three ground control animal groups were cut in half between hemispheres. One hemisphere of each brain was used for generating spatially resolved transcriptional profiling data. Hemispheres were cryosectioned so that 2 consecutive sections from the hippocampus of each brain was placed on Visium Gene Expression arrays. Samples were fixed, stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin and imaged. Imaging was followed by tissue permeabilization to release mRNA molecules from cells for capture onto the array surface. Subsequently, following the 10XGenomics Visium Gene Expression protocol, Spatial Transcriptomics RNA-seq libraries were prepared and sequenced. The other hemisphere of each brain was used for single nuclei RNA-seq and ATAC-seq using the 10X Multiome protocol. In addition, bulk RNA-seq (ribodepleted, target depth of 60 M clusters, PE 150 bp) was performed from a pool of RNA extracted from 10-20 sections from each of 3 flight and 3 ground control samples.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "All reagents were of LC-MS grade. Approximately 10 mg of tissue from RR9 (gastrocnemius and quadricep, habitat and flight) were added in a siliconized microcentrifuge tube, followed by addition of 300 ul of chilled 50%:50% methanol:water, containing 4 uM debrisoquine sulfate, 30 uM 4-nitrobenzoic acid, and 5 uM chlorpropamide as internal standards. All samples were randomized. The tissues were homogenized, followed by sonication for 10 sec. 10 ul was removed for protein quantification through a micro BCA assay (Thermo Scientific). Samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm at 4C and the supernatant was transferred to a clean siliconized microcentrifuge tube. Chilled 50%:50% acetonitrile:water (300 ul) was added to the pellet and vortexed thoroughly. Following a 15 min incubation on ice, samples were centrifuged again and the supernatant combined with the one previously obtained. The samples were vacuum dried and resuspended in 200 ul of 50%:50% methanol:water, without internal standards, and vortexed thoroughly. Samples were further filtered through a 0.2 um filter and subsequently transferred to a glass mass spectrometry vial.     2 ul of each sample was injected in a BEH C18 column, 130 Å, 1.7 um at 60°C and analyzed with a Waters Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) system coupled to a time-of-flight Xevo G2S mass spectrometry (MS) instrument, operated in MSE mode. A quality control sample was also generated by pooling together 5 ul from each sample, injected every 10 samples. Initial mass accuracy was determined with a mixture of 6 chemicals that ionize in both modes (acetaminophen, sulfaguanidine, sulfadimethoxine, Val-Tyr-Val, terfenadine, and leucine enkephalin). Mass correction and accuracy was achieved throughout the whole run with intermittent injections of leucine enkephalin as LockSpray.     Rodent Research-9 (RR-9) mission tissues were utilized for metabolomic analysis of the medial head of the gastrocnemius, and the quadriceps femoris ('quadriceps') on male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Labs) that spent ~34 days in microgravity aboard the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the RR-9 mission in August, 2017, that launched as part of the SpaceX Commercial Resupply Services (CRS)-12 mission. Seven days prior to launch (L-7d), 9-week old mice were grouped as mice to be sent to ISS (Flight; n equals 10); or ground-based habitat controls placed within in environmental chambers replicating the environmental conditions for the Flight mice aboard ISS (Habitat; n equals 10).     Unberthing from ISS and splashdown of live mice occurred on L+34d, and the live mice were collected by the science teams on L+35d for behavioral and functional testing, as well as tissue harvest. The gastrocnemius and quadriceps remained attached to the left hind limb after removal of the limb from the body by disarticulation at the acetabulum. The femur and tibia were disarticulated, the gastrocnemius was cut at the Achilles tendon, and both muscles remained attached to the femur which was then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at -80C until tissues were removed for metabolomic analysis.",

Pathway analysis showed significant enrichment of mitochondrial activity and innate immunity. Muscle and liver tissues showed that chronic inflammation, may be a response to mitochondrial dysfunction. Additional pathways altered in spaceflight included cell cycle, circadian rhythm, and olfactory activity pathways, all of which are known to have interactions with mitochondrial activity. Evidence of altered mitochondrial function was also found in the urine and blood metabolic data compiled from the astronaut cohort and NASA Twin Study data, all of which indicate mitochondrial stress as a consistent phenotype of spaceflight.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Total RNA was isolated from temporal bone, mandibular bone, spleen, liver, white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue, cerebrum, kidney, and thymus. RNA integrity was assessed using an Agilent 2200 TapeStation. For each tissue, 1.0_ug of total RNA was used for further steps. Total RNA was prepared using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN), ISOGEN (NIPPON GENE), or Sepasol (nakalai tesque).     Library construction was performed using the SureSelect Strand Specific RNA Library Prep Kit (Agilent Technologies) with poly(A) RNA or total RNA depleted of rRNA by Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (illumina).     The libraries were sequenced using HiSeq2500 (Illumina) for 76 cycles of single read and more than 17 million reads were generated per sample. The raw reads were mapped to the mouse mm10 genome using STAR (version 2.6.1).     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.1 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.1/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0) to generate the RSEM raw counts data. A set of rRNA-removed raw counts data was also created by removing Ensembl IDs that map to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) from the RSEM gene count data.     Nrf2-KO (Nfe212)16 and WT male mice in the C57BL/6J background were bred at Charles River Laboratories Japan for MHU3. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of JAXA (protocol numbers 017-001 and 017-014), NASA (protocol number FLT-17-112), and Explora BioLabs (EB15-010C), and conducted according to the related guidelines and applicable laws of Japan and the United States of America.  Three weeks prior to launch, 60 WT and 60 Nrf2-KO mice (8 weeks old) were delivered from Charles River Laboratories Japan to KSC. These mice were acclimatized to the environment in individual housing cages (Small Mouse Isolator 10027, Lab Products) in an air-conditioned room (temperature: 23 plus or minus  3 C; humidity: 40–65%) with a 12:12-h light/dark cycle at the SSPF Science Annex at KSC. Three acclimation phases were set: Phase I, body weight recovery phase; Phase II, water nozzle acclimation phase and Phase III, flight food acclimation phase. After approximately three weeks of acclimation, the mice were ready for transport to the ISS and had reached the age of 12 weeks. Succinctly, at Phase I, mice were fed CRF-1 and given autoclaved tap water ad libitum using ball-type water nozzles. The bedding material consisted of paper chips (ALPHA-DRI). At Phase II, water nozzles are changed to flight nozzles. Finally, at Phase III, the food was changed to flight food. Fecal collection and body swabs were obtained, and these samples were sent to Charles River Laboratories in USA for pol-based SPF testing.  As some of the Nrf2-KO mice harbor an intrahepatic shunt35, Nrf2-KO mice were challenged with 100 mg/kg ketamine and 5 mg/kg xylazine and recovery times were monitored at the age of 9 weeks to eliminate the mice harboring an intrahepatic shunt. Nrf2-KO mice with long sleeping duration were judged as mice without shunts. Blood was taken from tails of all 120 mice. During the acclimation phase, body weight and food/water consumption were measured and recorded. We selected 12 mice for flight and backup, respectively. The selection of flight candidate mice was based on body weight, food consumption, water intake, and absence of hepatic shunt. We also checked the health of each flight candidate mouse by evaluating the condition of their eyes, ears, teeth, fur, and tail. The five subgroups of flight candidates were necessary to support possible launch attempts in case of unexpected postponements.  One day prior to launch, 12 mice were loaded into the TCU and made ready for launch. Mice were transported to the ISS by SpX14. After the Dragon vehicle of SpX14 berthed with the ISS, mice were transferred to the HCU by a crew member. Mouse-husbandry tasks included exchanging food cartridges, supplying water, collecting waste, and replacing odor filters. The block food (approximately 35 g) is contained in the cartridge, which supports 1-week habitation. The cartridges have windows and scale at their sides, therefore the remaining amount of the foods was estimated, via video without returning them to the ground, at weekly food cartridge exchange operations. After 31 days onboard the ISS, mice were transferred to the TCU for the return to Earth.  A GC experiment that simulated the space experiment was conducted at JAXA Tsukuba in Japan from September 17 to October 20, 2018. Six WT and six Nrf2-KO mice without the hepatic shunts were individually housed in the same way as for the flight experiment. Both the TCU and HCU were placed in an air-conditioned room (average temperature: 22.9 C; average humidity: 48.4%) with a 12:12-h light/dark cycle. Fan-generated airflow (0.2 m/s) inside the HCU maintained the same conditions as in the flight experiment. The mice were fed CRF-1. The bedding material consisted of paper chips (ALPHA-DRI) in the acclimation cages, but was not used in the HCU. Feeder cartridges and water bottles were replaced once a week, and cages in the HCU were not replenished. After the health and body weights of mice were assessed, open field, light/dark transition and Y-maze tests were performed. Blood sampling from the tail was conducted as for the flight experiment.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module.  Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account.\n\nThe measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei).\n\nBoth active and passive dosimeters are used.  Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification.  Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground.\n\nThe dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload.\n\nThe duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped.  Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://www.nasa.gov/reference/osdr-environmental-data/.     After unberthing from the ISS, the Dragon vehicle splashed down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California. After a ship picked up the cargo, the returned TCU was transported to a port in Long Beach. JAXA received the TCU from NASA and transported them to Explora BioLabs in San Diego using an environmentally controlled van. After the health and body weights of mice were assessed, open field, light/dark transition and Y-maze tests were performed. Blood was collected from tail after the behavioral tests. Isoflurane-anesthetized mice were then euthanized by exsanguination and dissected for the collection of tissue samples.  Total RNA was isolated from temporal bone, mandibular bone, spleen, liver, white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue, cerebrum, kidney, and thymus.",

While there are many intractable limitations for in-flight space research, some can be overcome by utilizing gene knockout-disease model mice. Here, we report how deletion of Nrf2, a master regulator of stress defense pathways, affects the health of mice transported for a stay in the International Space Station (ISS). After 31 days in the ISS, all flight mice returned safely to Earth. Transcriptome and metabolome analyses revealed that the stresses of space travel evoked ageing-like changes of plasma metabolites and activated the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Especially, Nrf2 was found to be important for maintaining homeostasis of white adipose tissues. This study opens approaches for future space research utilizing murine gene knockout-disease models, and provides insights into mitigating space-induced stresses that limit the further exploration of space by humans.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Flight mice were sent to the International Space Station and maintained in microgravity for 33 days. Flight recovery mice were maintained at Explora Biolabs in California for two weeks after return from space. Ground mice were maintained under the identical environmental conditions as the flight mice at Kennedy Space Center in Orlando, FL and then transferred by ground transport to Explora Biolabs for analysis. Vivarium mice were maintained at the University of Connecticut in Farmington, CT. ACVR2B/Fc refers to a myostatin/activin A inhibitor that was administered by intraperitoeal injection. Details of each of these groups of mice can be found in the associated manuscript (Targeting myostatin/activin A protects against skeletal muscle and bone loss during spaceflight, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, published).     SomaScan analysis was performed as described in Williams et al., Nature Medicine 25:1851-1857, 2019. The entire procedure is described in detail in the Methods section.     SOMAmer reagents labeled with a 5’ fluorophore, photocleavable linker, and biotin are immobilized on streptavidin (SA)-coated beads and incubated with samples containing a complex mixture of proteins.Cognate and noncognate SOMAmer–target protein complexes form on the beads. The beads are washed, removing the unbound proteins and the proteins are tagged with biotin.     SOMAmer–protein complexes are released from the beads by photocleavage of the linker with UV light. Incubation in a buffer containing a polyanionic competitor selectively disrupts nonspecific interactions. SOMAmer–protein complexes are recaptured on a second set of streptavidin- coated beads through biotin-tagged proteins followed by additional washing steps that facilitate further removal of nonspecifically bound SOMAmer reagents.     A SOMAmer-protein binding step is followed by a series of partitioning and wash steps that converts relative protein concentrations into measurable nucleic acid signals that are quantified using DNA detection technology, which for the SOMAscan assay with over 1,300 SOMAmer reagents is by hybridization to custom DNA microarrays.     The SOMAscan assay quantitatively transforms the proteins present in a biological sample into a specific SOMAmer-based DNA signal.",

          "Study Description": "Among the physiological consequences of extended spaceflight are loss of skeletal muscle and bone mass. One signaling pathway that plays an important role in maintaining muscle and bone homeostasis is that regulated by the secreted signaling proteins, myostatin (MSTN) and activin A. Here, we used both genetic and pharmacological approaches to investigate the effect of targeting MSTN/activin A signaling in mice that were sent to the International Space Station. Wild type mice lost significant muscle and bone mass during the 33 d spent in microgravity. Muscle weights of Mstn -/- mice, which are about twice those of wild type mice, were largely maintained during spaceflight. Systemic inhibition of MSTN/activin A signaling using a soluble form of the activin type IIB receptor (ACVR2B), which can bind each of these ligands, led to dramatic increases in both muscle and bone mass, with effects being comparable in ground and flight mice. Exposure to microgravity and treatment with the soluble receptor each led to alterations in numerous signaling pathways, which were reflected in changes in levels of key signaling components in the blood as well as their RNA expression levels in muscle and bone. These findings have implications for therapeutic strategies to combat the concomitant muscle and bone loss occurring in people afflicted with disuse atrophy on Earth as well as in astronauts in space, especially during prolonged missions.",

Homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing beads in FastPrep instrument for 3s. Samples were centrifuged for 3 minutes at RT at maximum speed. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 30 ul of RNAse free H2O, and DNA was eluted in 50 ul RNAse free H2O. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA ribo depletion and library preparation was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Input RNA ranged between 61ng and 160ng with RIN greater than 7. Index adapters used were at 1.5 µM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit. Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scentific, Waltham, MA) following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as following: Read 1: 151bp, Index1: 17bp, Index2: 8bp Read 2: 151bp. PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     UMIs were extracted from fastq files using UMI-tools (version 1.1.2). Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), distance between forward and reverse reads using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data was imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.22.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).     A cohort of 12-week-old female BALB/c mice were flown to the ISS and housed in the Rodent Habitat and were subjected to microgravity for 39-42 days. Mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. Mice from the same cohort were dissected at time of launch and used as basal controls. One treatment injection was given prior to launch and the other two treatment injections were given during the mission with around 14 days apart. At the time of injection, Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scan was also performed while the animals were anesthestized by ketamine/xylazine.   At the end of the mission, spaceflight and ground controls had blood collected, were euthanized and one hindlimb removed and whole carcasses were stored at -80 C until BSP (Biospecimen Sharing Program) dissection on earth. [Spaceflight and ground control mice- untreated, injected with control Ig-G (sham treated).] The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     Mouse carcasses were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes for dissection. Each carcass dissection time was no longer than 1 hour from collection of the first tissue. Multiple tissues, including the heart tissue, were collected from each carcass. Heart tissues were harvested and snap frozen in LN2, then stored in -80 C freezer for sample processing. Heart tissue from spaceflight and ground control groups were shipped on dry ice to SciLifeLab Stockholm, KTH Royal Institute of Technology for processing.     Cryosectioning were performed at by SciLifeLab following 10X Genomics Visium protocol. https://www.10xgenomics.com/spatial-transcriptomics/  Visium is a commercially available kit produced by 10x Genomics, which allows to spatially visualize the gene expression of tissue sections.  The workflow starts with sectioning fresh frozen tissue and placing each section on one capture area of the Visium slide. Sectioning of heart tissues for bulk-RNAseq was performed simultaneously with sectioning for the Visium spatial gene expression protocol. 10-20 sections from each sample collected from various areas of the brain were placed into eppendorf tubes for RNA/DNA extraction and stored at -80 degrees freezer until processing.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample--ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was 'living', including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.     Sample prep were performed at by SciLifeLab following 10X Genomics Visium protocol. https://www.10xgenomics.com/spatial-transcriptomics/  Tissue is fixed and permeabilized to release mRNA from each section and mRNA molecules are captured by barcoded probes in their spatial location.   Subsequently, synthesis of cDNA is performed on the Visium slide in order to introduce the corresponding spatial barcodes to each mRNA molecule.     Sequencing library constructions were performed by SciLifeLab following 10X Genomics Visium protocol. (https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression)     Sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Paired end: read 1 at 28 bp and read 2 at 120 bp.  PhiX included as control.     rRNA percentages of raw fastq reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of Mus-musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.8) was used to generate MultiQC reports.",

Twenty BALB/c, 12-weeks old female mice (ten controls and ten treated) were flown to the ISS and housed in the Rodent Habitat for 39-42 days. Twenty mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. Basal controls were housed in standard vivarium cages. Spaceflight, ground controls and basal groups had blood collected, then were euthanized, had one hind limb removed, and finally whole carcasses were stored at -80 C until dissection. All mice in this data set received only the control/sham injection. Spatially resolved transcriptional profiles were generated from hearts from three flight and three ground control animals as follows. Hearts were cryosectioned longitudinally onto an array of capture probes that bind RNA, fixed, stained and visualized. Heart sections were then permeabilized to release RNA onto the capture probes, and cDNA synthesized on the chip so that its spatial arrangement is encoded within a set of molecular barcodes. cDNA was then released and sequenced. Four to five levels of each heart was analyzed in this manner to allow a 3D reconstruction of the transcriptome. In addition, bulk RNA-seq (ribodepleted, target depth of 60 M clusters, PE 150 bp) was performed from a pool of RNA extracted from 10-20 sections from each of 3 flight and 2 ground control samples.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "RR-1: A cohort of 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Lab) were flown to the ISS, housed in the Rodent Habitat and were subjected to microgravity for 37 days. Mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. Additionally, mice from the same cohort were used as basal control and vivarium control. Basal control mice were euthanized the day after launch as baseline references. Vivarium animals were housed in standard vivarium cages for the same amount of time as spaceflight and ground control animals. The flight animals were euthanized by ISS crew with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation, frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C) and brought back to Earth. All the control group mice were processed with the same protocol of flight mice. RR-3:A cohort of 12-week-old female BALB/c mice were flown to the ISS, housed in the Rodent Habitat and were subjected to microgravity for 39-42 days. Mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. Basal mice were from the same cohort and were dissected at time of launch.  At the end of the mission, spaceflight and ground controls had blood collected, were euthanized and one hindlimb removed and whole carcasses were stored at -80 C until BSP (Biospecimen Sharing Program) dissection on earth. [Spaceflight and ground control mice- untreated, injected with control Ig-G (sham treated). Basal mice received no injections.]     RR-1: Samples were collected and processed as described in GLDS-48 (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-48). Mouse carcasses were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes. Multiple tissues, including liver, were collected from each carcass. Total dissection time for each carcass was no longer than 30 minutes since collection of the first tissue.  Liver was preserved in RLT buffer, homogenized and snap frozen with liquid nitrogen. RR-3: Samples were collected and processed as described in GLDS-137 (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-137). Mouse carcasses were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes for dissection. Each carcass dissection time was no longer than 1 hour from collection of the first tissue. Multiple tissues, including the liver tissue, were collected from each carcass. Liver tissues were harvested and snap frozen in LN2, then stored separately in -80 C freezer for sample processing. GeneLab Sample Processing Lab processed the liver tissues from spaceflight, ground control, and basal control groups for transcriptomics.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.     Samples were generated at the time of sample collection for GLDS-48 (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-48) and GLDS-137 (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-137) studies. Extracted RNA aliquots were stored at -80 C. RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 volumes beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT and kept on ice until use. Approximately 25 mg of frozen liver tissue was immediately placed in 600 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at room temperature at 21,300 g to remove cell debris. Following the manufacturer's protocol, RNA were isolated and purified from the supernatant. RNA was eluted in 40 uL RNase-free H2O. RNA concentrations were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     After nucleic acid extraction, samples were aliquoted and stored at -80 C . Samples designated for sequencing were transferred to dry ice to avoid thawing. ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes 1 or 2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, cat# 4456739) at 1:100 dilution were then pipetted on top of the frozen samples at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer. Samples were returned to the -80 C freezer until transfer to omics core facility.     RNA sequencing library construction was peroformed by UC Davis Genome Center. Ribosomal RNA was removed with the Illumina RiboZero Gold ribo-depletion kit before RNA sequencing libraries were constructred using the Kapa RNA Hyper strand-specific kit. The libraries were QC-ed by bioanalyzer and quantified by fluorometric Qubit measurements.     The RNA library sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform, across 40 libraries with 150 bp paired end reads (forward anti-sense strand; reverse read sense strand). 100 million reads per sample was requested. Performed by UC Davis Genome Center.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8) and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 96 genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus +ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.7) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.2) with tximport (version 1.22.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. The data was normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only group B ERCC genes to estimate the size factor*. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).   *ERCC-normalized data are available upon request.",

The presence of these RNA standards at known ratios improves interpretation of RNA sequencing datasets. To test the utility of the ERCC RNA controls, total RNA extracted from mouse livers from the Rodent Research 1 (flight, ground control, basal control and vivarium control groups) and Rodent Research 3 (flight, ground control and basal control groups) missions were sequenced with and without the ERCC control RNA (RR-3 liver samples without ERCC control have been sequenced previously and the dataset is released in the GLDS-137). To allow comparison within and between groups, ERCC Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added to half of the samples from each group, respectively.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "All animal experiments were approved by the ISS and Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs), and were performed in facilities accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC). This research complied with the Animal Welfare Act and implementing Animal Welfare Regulations, the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animal. Briefly, 9-week-old, male C57BL/6J mice were used for this study. Cages of 10 mice were randomly selected to be housed on the ISS (spaceflight [FLT]) or at KSC (CTR). The ground control study at KSC began with a 5-day offset. Both FLT and CTR mice were housed under similar caging conditions including 12-hour light/dark cycle and were provided with the same diet/water ad libitum. Mice were humanely euthanized 24 to 28 days post-launch when the mice were around 13 weeks of age. Five of 10 mice/group were reserved for imaging studies. For the remaining five mice, the carcasses were snap-frozen at -80C.     FLT samples were returned to Earth; and all samples were processed at the same time in the same laboratory. Therefore, a maximum of five mice/group were available for these studies. Four randomly selected FLT and CTR carcasses were used for omics analyses. The muscle tissues were isolated and frozen at -80C for further analysis.  Upon retrieving the right leg quadriceps, extensor digitorum longus (EDL), and soleus muscle tissue from the freezer, their wet weights were recorded. Next, we proceeded with the quadriceps tissue for multiomics assay.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module.

Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.     The quadriceps was cryogenically homogenized using a Cryomill (Haan, Germany). An aliquot of the homogenate was allotted to extract DNA and RNA using the standard TRIzol (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, MA, USA) method.     The sequencing library preparation was carried out using 500ng of total RNA input with the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA) following the manufacturer's procedures. In brief, total RNA was fragmented using divalent cations under elevated temperature. Cleaved RNA fragments were then converted to first strand cDNA using reverse transcriptase SuperScript II (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). Strand selection was done by replacing dTTP with dUTP followed by second strand cDNA synthesis using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA). A tail was added to the 3' ends of the blunt fragments. Unique indexing adapters were ligated to the ends of the ds cDNA fragments and the products were enriched with PCR and purified to create the final cDNA library. The quality of the libraries were determined using the on D1000 ScreenTape on the Agilent TapeStation 2200 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Libraries were quantified with real-time quantitative PCR using KAPA SYBR FAST Universal qPCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems). Next, the libraries were normalized, pooled, and quantified using the dsDNA HS Kit on the Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer     For large-scale mRNA sequencing, 2 x 150 cycles of paired-end reads were generated in HiSeq4000 platform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.2 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.2/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1).",

          "Study Description": "Prolonged residence of mice in spaceflight is a scientifically robust and ethically ratified model of muscle atrophy caused by continued unloading. Under the Rodent Research Program of NASA, we assayed the genomic and metabolomics perturbations in the quadriceps of C57BL/6J male mice that lived on the spaceflight (FLT) or at Ground Control (CTR) for approximately four weeks. Wet weight of quadriceps were significantly reduced in FLT mice. Deep next generation sequencing and untargeted mass spectroscopic assay interrogated the gene-metabolite landscape of same tissues. A majority of top ranked differentially suppressed genes in FLT encode proteins from myosin or troponin family suggesting a sarcomere alteration in space. Significantly enriched gene-metabolite networks were found linked to saromeric integrity, immune fitness and oxidative stress response; all inhibited in space as per in silico prediction. A significant loss of FLT mitochondrial DNA copy numbers underlined the energy deprivation associated with spaceflight induced stress, and this hypothesis was reinforced by the omics analysis that showed inhibited networks related to protein, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. Finally, we reported a list of upstream regulators, which could be targeted for next generation therapeutic intervention for the betterment of the musculoskeletal system in male mice subjected to chronic disuse. Abbreviation Key: Sham surgical procedure done (Sh); non-surgical control (NS); Ground Control group (G); Flight Group (F); Whole Body frozen as sample on ISS (W).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Total RNA was extracted from the thymus using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).     The RNA-Seq library was prepared by using the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs [NEB], Ipswich, MA) after depleting rRNA (NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit; NEB).     Paired-end sequencing (2 × 36 bases) was performed by using NextSeq500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.1) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.0 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.0/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1).     Pre-acclimation of mice was conducted in the Space Station Processing Facility Science Annex at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida, USA. Twelve C57BL/6 J male mice (8-week-old for MHU-1 and 9-week-old for MHU-2) in transportation cage units (TCU) were launched aboard the SpaceX rocket from the KSC and transported to the ISS. On board, mice were transferred to habitat cage units (HCU) and housed singly under AG (1 × g on the bottom floor of the HCU, at a centrifugation speed of 77 rpm) or MG environments. In the return process, all mice were transferred to TCUs, and the Dragon vehicle loaded with the TCUs was splashed down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California, USA. Returned TCUs were transported to a port in Long Beach by ship, and then to the tissue collection site by road. The ground control experiment replicating the housing conditions of the flight experiment was conducted at the JAXA Tsukuba Space Center in Japan.     Following euthanasia, thymi were removed and cut, and a quarter of the thymi was snap-frozen in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek, Japan) and a second quarter of the thymus was used for RNA preparation. Thymi for RNA preparation was quickly frozen in liquid N2, and kept in dry ice and then in a −80 °C freezer.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://www.nasa.gov/reference/osdr-environmental-data/.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Twenty (20) mice (female, 10 C57BL/6J mice and 10 C3H/HeJ mice, ~11 weeks of age at launch) were launched in one Transporter and transferred to two Rodent Habitats without dividers onboard the International Space Station (ISS). In the Transporter, the C57 mice were housed on one side of the unit and the C3H were housed on the other side, with a wire grid divider separating the two sides and strains. Each strain was then housed in its own Habitat for the remainder of the study.   Half of the mice from each strain (5) were maintained in microgravity for ~25 days before being euthanized, scanned using Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), and dissected on the ISS (Timepoint 1 group), while the other half were maintained in microgravity for a total of ~75 days before euthanasia, DEXA scan, and dissection (Timepoint 2 group).  The Baseline, Vivarium, and Ground Control groups were all maintained, euthanized, and dissected at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Ground Control and Vivarium animals were euthanized and dissected at 2 Timepoints, mimicking treatment of Flight animals.  The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol (Protocol number RR7) was approved on Dec. 14, 2017 by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     All of the mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of Ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine. Liver, gastronitestinal tract, and spleen were collected followed by carcass sectioning into 3 sections, head, chest, and abdomen with tail removed and discarded.Carcass sections were submerged and preserved in RNAlater, refrigerated at 4C for ~72 hrs, and the frozen at ~-95C. All tissue samples and sectioned carcasses were returned to earth on SpaceX-16 on January 13, 2019 and delivered to Northwestern University for final dissection.  Baseline, Vivarium, and Ground Control samples were shipped to Northwestern University at three different times (late-July, mid-September, and late-September 2018). Dissections for tissues from all experimental groups were completed at Northwestern University by the PI groups along with NASA's Biospecimen Sharing Program in February 2019. All skin tissues used for extraction in this dataset were preserved in RNAlater after dissection and stored at -80C. The frozen preserved tissues were shipped frozen to NASA Ames Research Center and handled by LSDA.     The skin samples were thawed on ice, approximately 50mg of skin tissue was weighed and immediately placed in 1 mL of the TRIzol solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 X g for 10 minutes at 4C to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate RNA following the manufacturer's protocol. The isolated RNA was then purified on column with DNAse I (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valenica, CA). The purified RNA was eluted in 50 uL H2O. Concentration of RNA was measured using the Qubit 3 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with Qubit RNA BR kit. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA Cat # 4456739, v92) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added immediately after RNA extractions at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol.     RNA ribo depletion was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN > 4. Index adapters were 1.5 uM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size ~300 bp was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured by Universal qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control was determined by iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Paired end 98bp. PhiX included as control.     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.1.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.4). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.8) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 96, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.3a) and aligned reads from 3 samples were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.0.3) with tximport (version 1.18.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.30.0). The data was normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.30.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.2.0), PANTHER.db (v1.0.10), and org.Mm.eg.db (v3.12.0).",

To this end, ten 11-week-old female C57BL/6J and ten 11-week-old female C3H/HeJ mice were flown to the International Space Station on June 29, 2018 on SpaceX-15 and housed in two Rodent Habitats. Samples of food, swabs from living surfaces, and fecal pellets were collected from each animal before launch and regularly during the mission. The mission also involved extended video collection (48 hr video segments per Habitat) to monitor circadian rhythms, and on-orbit mass measurement. After 25 days on-orbit, half of the mice of each strain were euthanized on the ISS with Ketamine/Xylazine/Acepromazine and cardiac puncture, after which carcasses were segmented in three sections and preserved in RNA later. After 75-76 days the remaining 5 animals from each group were euthanized and processed in the same manner. The 25-day dissected carcasses returned on SpX-15, and the 75-day dissected carcasses returned on SpX-16. In addition to the Flight group, three ground control groups were also part of the study: Basal (representing the pre-launch state), Vivarium (standard vivarium housing for the same duration of time as flight), and Ground (same habitat in the International Space Station Environment Simulator, ISSES). Twenty mice (10 of each strain) were included in each of these control groups, which were euthanized and processed on the same schedule and in the same manner as the flight samples. Dissections for tissues from all experimental groups were completed by the PI groups along with NASA's Biospecimen Sharing Program in February 2019. GeneLab received dorsal skin samples from forty C57BL/6J mice: 10 Basal, 5 Ground (25 days), 5 Ground (75 days), 5 Flight (25 days), 5 Flight (75 days), 5 Vivarium (25 days), 5 Vivarium (75 days). GeneLab received dorsal skin samples from forty C3H/HeJ mice: 10 Basal, 5 Ground (25 days), 5 Ground (75 days), 5 Flight (25 days), 5 Flight (75 days), 5 Vivarium (25 days), 5 Vivarium (75 days). From these skin samples, RNA was extracted, libraries generated (stranded, ribodepleted) and sequenced (target 60 M clusters at PE 98 bp).",

All kidney tissues used for extraction in this dataset were preserved in RNAlater after dissection and stored at -80C. The frozen preserved tissues were shipped frozen to NASA Ames Research Center and handled by LSDA.     RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 20 mg of frozen tissue was isolated using a scalpel, weighed and immediately placed in 600 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix (Navy RINO Lysis, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 3 minutes at 4C. Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 uL RNAse free H2O. Concentration for all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR kit. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA Cat # 4456739, v92) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol.     RNA ribo depletion was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN greater than 4. Index adapters were 1.5 uM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size ~300 bp was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured by Universal qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control was determined by iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Paired end 98bp. PhiX included as control.     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.1.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.0 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.0/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0), ERCC genes were removed, and the non-ERCC genes were normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis_GLbulkRNAseq.html report.",

To this end, ten 11-week-old female C57BL/6J and ten 11-week-old female C3H/HeJ mice were flown to the International Space Station on June 29, 2018 on SpaceX-15 and housed in two Rodent Habitats. Samples of food, swabs from living surfaces, and fecal pellets were collected from each animal before launch and regularly during the mission. The mission also involved extended video collection (48 hr video segments per Habitat) to monitor circadian rhythms, and on-orbit mass measurement. After 25 days on-orbit, half of the mice of each strain were euthanized on the ISS with Ketamine/Xylazine/Acepromazine and cardiac puncture, after which carcasses were segmented in three sections and preserved in RNA later. After 75-76 days the remaining 5 animals from each group were euthanized and processed in the same manner. The 25-day dissected carcasses returned on SpX-15, and the 75-day dissected carcasses returned on SpX-16. In addition to the Flight group, three ground control groups were also part of the study: Basal (representing the pre-launch state), Vivarium (standard vivarium housing for the same duration of time as flight), and Ground (same habitat in the International Space Station Environment Simulator, ISSES). Twenty mice (10 of each strain) were included in each of these control groups, which were euthanized and processed on the same schedule and in the same manner as the flight samples. Dissections for tissues from all experimental groups were completed by the PI groups along with NASA's Biospecimen Sharing Program in February 2019. GeneLab received kidneys from thirty-eight C57BL/6J mice: 9 Basal, 5 Ground (25 days), 4 Ground (75 days), 5 Flight (25 days), 5 Flight (75 days), 5 Vivarium (25 days), 5 Vivarium (75 days). GeneLab received kidneys from thirty-nine C3H/HeJ mice: 9 Basal, 5 Ground (25 days), 5 Ground (75 days), 5 Flight (25 days), 5 Flight (75 days), 5 Vivarium (25 days), 5 Vivarium (75 days). From these kidneys, RNA was extracted, libraries generated (stranded, ribodepleted) and sequenced (target 60 M clusters at PE 98 bp).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "A cohort of 36 weeks-old female C57BL/6 mice (Taconic Biosciences) were flown to the ISS and were housed in the Rodent Habitat. Half of the mice were subjected to microgravity for ~30 days and returned to earth alive before euthanization (Live Animal Return, LAR). The other half were subjected to microgravity for 52-55 days before euthanzing on ISS (Iss-Terminal, ISS-T).  All the animals from which the samples were processed in this dataset were operated to insert an implantable subcutaneous nanochannel delivery system prior to launch to deliver sham treatment. The cocktail included Propylene glycol (20%v/v), 1N HCL (10%v/v), Solutol HS 15 (10%v/v), 1N NaOH (5%v/v), PBS (12.5%v/v), and water (42.5%v/v).  The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol (Protocol number RR6) was approved on Oct. 24, 2017 by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample--the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was 'living', including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.     After ~30 days in microgravity, half ot the mice returned to earth alive (LAR Flight) and were euthanized by Isoflurane inhalation and were dissected immediately at Novartis Facilities.  The other half of mice were euthanized on ISS (ISS-Terminal Flight) by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine after ~60 days in microgravity. Following blood draw and hind limb dissection, the carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, placed in a ziploc bag and placed in storage at -80C or colder until return to earth and dissected at Houston at a later date.  There were two Baseline groups of animals sacrificed (LAR Baseline & ISS-T Baseline) at Kennedy Space Center. A Ground Control group (LAR Ground Control) mimicked the LAR Flight group, which was housed at KSC, then shipped alive to Novartis Facilities, where both the LAR Flight and LAR Ground Control groups were processed.  The ISS-Terminal Ground Controls, housed at KSC, followed the same euthanasia timeline, methods, and preservation of the ISS-Terminal Flight. The final dissection of frozen 60-day ISS-Terminal Flight, frozen 60-day ISS-Terminal Ground Controls and 0-day FLT baseline anmials were completed at Houston Methodist Research Institute, in Houston, Texas. For all ISS-T groups, on the day of dissection, the frozen carcasses were removed from -80C freezer and placed in 4C fridge for thawing prior to dissection.  Multiple tissues were collected from each carcass by Primary PI and NASA BSP. All the spleen tissues used for extraction in this dataset were preserved in liquid nitrogen after dissection and stored at -80C.  The frozen preserved tissues were shipped frozen to NASA Ames Research Center and handled by LSDA.     RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 30 mg of frozen tissue was isolated using a scalpel, weighed and immediately placed in 600 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix (Zirconium Oxide 2.0mm Beads, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 5 minutes at 4C. Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer protocol.  RNA was eluted in 50 uL RNAse free H2O. Concentration for all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).  RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA Cat   4456739, v92) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol.     RNA ribo depletion was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold. Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN > 4. Index adapters were 1.5 uM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size ~300 bp was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured by Universal qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control was determined by iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Paired end 149bp. PhiX included as control.     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.1 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.1/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. Note that since greater than 60% of the reads in sample Mmus_C57-6T_SPL_FLT_LAR_Rep5_F7 were classified as unalignable to the transcriptome by RSEM, it was excluded from count normalization and differential expression analysis. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0), ERCC genes were removed, and the non-ERCC genes were normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value.

The experiment involved an implantable subcutaneous nanochannel delivery system (nDS; between scapula), which delivered the drug formoterol (FMT; a selective Beta-2 adrenoceptor agonist), over the course of time. To this end, a cohort of forty 32-weeks-old female C57BL/6NTac mice were either sham operated or implanted with vehicle or treatment-filled nDS, launched in two Transporters (20 mice per Transporter) on SpaceX-13 on December 15, 2017. They were transferred to Rodent Habitats onboard the International Space Station (ISS), and maintained in microgravity for 29 days (N of 20, Live Animal Return [LAR]), or >50 days (N of 20, ISS Terminal). After 29 days, the 20 LAR animals were returned live to back to Earth on January 13, 2018,. After splashdown, the animals were ambulatory on-ground for ~4 days, until all subjects were processed during one day of dissections. There were two Baseline groups of animals sacrificed (LAR Baseline & FLT Baseline; N of 20; 40 animals; ~36 weeks old) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC; 12/9/17). A Ground Control group mimicked the Flight LAR group, which was housed at KSC, then shipped alive, to Novartis' Facilities, where both the LAR and LAR Ground Control groups were processed (~41 weeks old; 1/16/18). All were anesthetized with isoflurane, blood samples were obtained by closed-chest cardiac puncture, and the animals were euthanized by exsanguination and thoracotomy. The 20 ISS Terminal mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine over the course of a four days of dissections (2/6/18 until 2/9/18; 53-56 days after launch; 44 weeks old at time of on-orbit dissections). Blood samples and euthanasia were conducted the same as LAR and Baseline. Following blood draw and hind limb dissection, the ISS-terminal animal carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, placed in a ziploc bag and placed in storage at -80C or colder until return. The ISS-terminal Ground Controls (at KSC) followed the same euthanasia timeline, methods, and preservation. The final processing of frozen ISS-terminal, frozen ISS-terminal Ground Controls and frozen 0-day FLT baseline animals were completed at Houston Methodist Research Institute, in Houston, TX (5/21/18 until 5/24/18). This study features data from only sham treated animals (no drug treated animals) from the following groups Flight: LAR (N of 8), ISS Terminal (N of 7); Ground Controls: LAR (N of 9), ISS Terminal (N of 7); Baseline: LAR (N of 10), ISS Terminal (N of 3). Total RNA was extracted and sequenced at a target depth of 60 M clusters per sample (ribodepleted, paired end 150).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "A cohort of 36 weeks-old female C57BL/6 mice (Taconic Biosciences) were flown to the ISS and were housed in the Rodent Habitat. Half of the mice were subjected to microgravity for ~30 days and returned to earth alive before euthanization (Live Animal Return, LAR). The other half were subjected to microgravity for 52-55 days before euthanzing on ISS (Iss-Terminal, ISS-T).  All the animals from which the samples were processed in this dataset were operated to insert an implantable subcutaneous nanochannel delivery system prior to launch to deliver sham treatment. The cocktail included Propylene glycol (20%v/v), 1N HCL (10%v/v), Solutol HS 15 (10%v/v), 1N NaOH (5%v/v), PBS (12.5%v/v), and water (42.5%v/v).  The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol (Protocol number RR6) was approved on Oct. 24, 2017 by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     After ~30 days in microgravity, half ot the mice returned to earth alive (LAR Flight) and were euthanized by Isoflurane inhalation and were dissected immediately at Novartis Facilities.  The other half of mice were euthanized on ISS (ISS-Terminal Flight) by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine after ~60 days in microgravity. Following blood draw and hind limb dissection, the carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, placed in a ziploc bag and placed in storage at -80C or colder until return to earth and dissected at Houston at a later date.  There were two Baseline groups of animals sacrificed (LAR Baseline & ISS-T Baseline) at Kennedy Space Center. A Ground Control group (LAR Ground Control) mimicked the LAR Flight group, which was housed at KSC, then shipped alive to Novartis Facilities, where both the LAR Flight and LAR Ground Control groups were processed.  The ISS-Terminal Ground Controls, housed at KSC, followed the same euthanasia timeline, methods, and preservation of the ISS-Terminal Flight. The final dissection of frozen 60-day ISS-Terminal Flight, frozen 60-day ISS-Terminal Ground Controls and 0-day FLT baseline anmials were completed at Houston Methodist Research Institute, in Houston, Texas. For all ISS-T groups, on the day of dissection, the frozen carcasses were removed from -80C freezer and placed in 4C fridge for thawing prior to dissection.  Multiple tissues were collected from each carcass by Primary PI and NASA BSP. All the liver tissues used for extraction in this dataset were preserved in liquid nitrogen after dissection and stored at -80C.  The frozen preserved tissues were shipped frozen to NASA Ames Research Center and handled by LSDA.     RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 30 mg of frozen tissue was isolated using a scalpel, weighed and immediately placed in 600 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix (Zirconium Oxide 2.0mm Beads, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 5 minutes at 4C. Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer protocol.  RNA was eluted in 50 uL RNAse free H2O. Concentration for all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).  RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA Cat   4456739, v92) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol.     RNA ribo depletion was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold. Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN > 4. Index adapters were 1.5 uM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size ~300 bp was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured by Universal qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control was determined by iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Paired end 149bp. PhiX included as control.     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 96, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads from 3 samples were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward. Raw RSEM count data were re-processed through normalization and DGE analysis as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md) Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0). The data was normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis.html report. *ERCC-normalized data are available upon request.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "A cohort of 36 weeks-old female C57BL/6 mice (Taconic Biosciences) were flown to the ISS and were housed in the Rodent Habitat. Half of the mice were subjected to microgravity for ~30 days and returned to earth alive before euthanization (Live Animal Return, LAR). The other half were subjected to microgravity for 52-55 days before euthanzing on ISS (Iss-Terminal, ISS-T).  All the animals from which the samples were processed in this dataset were operated to insert an implantable subcutaneous nanochannel delivery system prior to launch to deliver sham treatment. The cocktail included Propylene glycol (20%v/v), 1N HCL (10%v/v), Solutol HS 15 (10%v/v), 1N NaOH (5%v/v), PBS (12.5%v/v), and water (42.5%v/v).  The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol (Protocol number RR6) was approved on Oct. 24, 2017 by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     After ~30 days in microgravity, half ot the mice returned to earth alive (LAR Flight) and were euthanized by Isoflurane inhalation and were dissected immediately at Novartis Facilities.  The other half of mice were euthanized on ISS (ISS-Terminal Flight) by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine after ~60 days in microgravity. Following blood draw and hind limb dissection, the carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, placed in a ziploc bag and placed in storage at -80C or colder until return to earth and dissected at Houston at a later date.  There were two Baseline groups of animals sacrificed (LAR Baseline & ISS-T Baseline) at Kennedy Space Center. A Ground Control group (LAR Ground Control) mimicked the LAR Flight group, which was housed at KSC, then shipped alive to Novartis Facilities, where both the LAR Flight and LAR Ground Control groups were processed.  The ISS-Terminal Ground Controls, housed at KSC, followed the same euthanasia timeline, methods, and preservation of the ISS-Terminal Flight. The final dissection of frozen 60-day ISS-Terminal Flight, frozen 60-day ISS-Terminal Ground Controls and 0-day FLT baseline anmials were completed at Houston Methodist Research Institute, in Houston, Texas. For all ISS-T groups, on the day of dissection, the frozen carcasses were removed from -80C freezer and placed in 4C fridge for thawing prior to dissection.  Multiple tissues were collected from each carcass by Primary PI and NASA BSP. All the lung tissues used for extraction in this dataset were preserved in liquid nitrogen after dissection and stored at -80C.  The frozen preserved tissues were shipped frozen to NASA Ames Research Center and handled by LSDA.     RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 30 mg of frozen tissue was isolated using a scalpel, weighed and immediately placed in 600 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix (Zirconium Oxide 2.0mm Beads, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 5 minutes at 4C. Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer protocol.  RNA was eluted in 50 uL RNAse free H2O. Concentration for all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).  RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA Cat # 4456739, v92) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol.     RNA ribo depletion was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold. Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN > 4. Index adapters were 1.5 uM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size ~300 bp was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured by Universal qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control was determined by iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Paired end 149bp. PhiX included as control.     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.4). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.8) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 96, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.3a) and aligned reads from 3 samples were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward. Raw RSEM count data were re-processed through normalization and DGE analysis as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md) Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0). The data was normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis.html report. *ERCC-normalized data are available upon request.",

The experiment involved an implantable subcutaneous nanochannel delivery system (nDS; between scapula), which delivered the drug formoterol (FMT; a selective Beta-2 adrenoceptor agonist), over the course of time. To this end, a cohort of forty 32-weeks-old female C57BL/6NTac mice were either sham operated or implanted with vehicle or treatment-filled nDS, launched in two Transporters (20 mice per Transporter) on SpaceX-13 on December 15, 2017. They were transferred to Rodent Habitats onboard the International Space Station (ISS), and maintained in microgravity for 29 days (N=20, Live Animal Return [LAR]), or >50 days (N=20, ISS Terminal). After 29 days, the 20 LAR animals were returned live to back to Earth on January 13, 2018,. After splashdown, the animals were ambulatory on-ground for ~4 days, until all subjects were processed during one day of dissections. There were two Baseline groups of animals sacrificed (LAR Baseline & FLT Baseline; N=20; 40 animals; ~36 weeks old) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC; 12/9/17). A Ground Control group mimicked the Flight LAR group, which was housed at KSC, then shipped alive, to Novartis' Facilities, where both the LAR and LAR Ground Control groups were processed (~41 weeks old; 1/16/18). All were anesthetized with isoflurane, blood samples were obtained by closed-chest cardiac puncture, and the animals were euthanized by exsanguination and thoracotomy. The 20 ISS Terminal mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine over the course of a four days of dissections (2/6/18 until 2/9/18; 53-56 days after launch; 44 weeks old at time of on-orbit dissections). Blood samples and euthanasia were conducted the same as LAR and Baseline. Following blood draw and hind limb dissection, the ISS-terminal animal carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, placed in a ziploc bag and placed in storage at -80C or colder until return. The ISS-terminal Ground Controls (at KSC) followed the same euthanasia timeline, methods, and preservation. The final processing of frozen ISS-terminal, frozen ISS-terminal Ground Controls and frozen 0-day FLT baseline animals were completed at Houston Methodist Research Institute, in Houston, TX (5/21/18 until 5/24/18). GeneLab received samples of lung from only sham treated animals (no drug treated animals) from the following groups Flight: LAR (n=10), ISS Terminal (n= 10); Ground Controls: LAR GC (N=9), ISS Terminal GC (N=10), LAR Baseline (n=10) ISS Terminal Baseline (n=9). Total RNA was extracted and sequenced at a target depth of 60 M clusters per sample (ribodepleted, paired end 150).",

Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.1 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.1/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. Note that since greater than 60% of the reads in samples Mmus_C57-6T_TMS_FLT_LAR_Rep1_F1, Mmus_C57-6T_TMS_FLT_LAR_Rep8_F9, and Mmus_C57-6T_TMS_GC_LAR_Rep7_G8 were classified as unalignable to the transcriptome by RSEM, they were excluded from count normalization and differential expression analysis. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0), ERCC genes were removed, and the non-ERCC genes were normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1).

There were two Baseline groups of animals sacrificed (LAR Baseline & FLT Baseline; N=20; 40 animals; ~36 weeks old) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC; 12/9/17). A Ground Control group mimicked the Flight LAR group, which was housed at KSC, then shipped alive, to Novartis' facilities, where both the LAR and LAR Ground Control groups were processed (~41 weeks old; 1/16/18). All were anesthetized with isoflurane, blood samples were obtained by closed-chest cardiac puncture, and the animals were euthanized by exsanguination and thoracotomy. The 20 ISS Terminal mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine over the course of a four days of dissections (2/6/18 until 2/9/18; 53-56 days after launch; 44 weeks old at time of on-orbit dissections). Blood samples and euthanasia were conducted the same as LAR and Baseline. Following blood draw and hind limb dissection, the ISS-terminal animal carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, placed in a ziploc bag and placed in storage at -80C or colder until return. The ISS-terminal Ground Controls (at KSC) followed the same euthanasia timeline, methods, and preservation. The final processing of frozen ISS-terminal, frozen ISS-terminal Ground Controls and frozen 0-day FLT baseline animals were completed at Houston Methodist Research Institute, in Houston, TX (5/21/18 until 5/24/18). GeneLab received samples of thymus from only sham treated animals (no drug treated animals) from the following groups Flight: LAR (n=9), ISS Terminal (n=10); Ground Controls: LAR GC (N=9), ISS Terminal GC (N=10), LAR Baseline (n=10) ISS Terminal Baseline (n=9). Total RNA was extracted and sequenced at a target depth of 60 M clusters per sample (ribodepleted, paired end 150).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "A cohort of 36 weeks-old female C57BL/6 mice (Taconic Biosciences) were flown to the ISS and were housed in the Rodent Habitat. Half of the mice were subjected to microgravity for ~30 days and returned to earth alive before euthanization (Live Animal Return, LAR). The other half were subjected to microgravity for 52-55 days before euthanzing on ISS (Iss-Terminal, ISS-T).  All the animals from which the samples were processed in this dataset were operated to insert an implantable subcutaneous nanochannel delivery system prior to launch to deliver sham treatment. The cocktail included Propylene glycol (20%v/v), 1N HCL (10%v/v), Solutol HS 15 (10%v/v), 1N NaOH (5%v/v), PBS (12.5%v/v), and water (42.5%v/v). The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol (Protocol number RR6) was approved on Oct. 24, 2017 by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     After ~30 days in microgravity, half ot the mice returned to earth alive (LAR Flight) and were euthanized by Isoflurane inhalation and were dissected immediately at Novartisâ€™s Facilities.  The other half of mice were euthanized on ISS (ISS-Terminal Flight) by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine after ~60 days in microgravity. Following blood draw and hind limb dissection, the carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, placed in a ziploc bag and placed in storage at -80C or colder until return to earth and dissected at Houston at a later date.  There were two Baseline groups of animals sacrificed (LAR Baseline & ISS-T Baseline) at Kennedy Space Center. A Ground Control group (LAR Ground Control) mimicked the LAR Flight group, which was housed at KSC, then shipped alive, to Novartis Facilities, where both the LAR Flight and LAR Ground Control groups were processed.  The ISS-Terminal Ground Controls, housed at KSC, followed the same euthanasia timeline, methods, and preservation of the ISS-Terminal Flight. The final dissection of frozen 60-day ISS-Terminal Flight, frozen 60-day ISS-Terminal Ground Controls and 0-day FLT baseline anmials were completed at Houston Methodist Research Institute, in Houston, Texas. For all ISS-T groups, on the day of dissection, the frozen carcasses were removed from -80C freezer and placed in 4C fridge for thawing prior to dissection.  Multiple tissues were collected from each carcass by Primary PI and NASA BSP. All the skin tissues used for extraction in this dataset were preserved in liquid nitrogen after dissection and stored at -80C.  The frozen preserved tissues were shipped frozen to NASA Ames Research Center and handled by LSDA.     While keeping the tissue frozen on dry ice and using a scalpel, approximately 50mg of skin tissue was weighed and immediately placed in 1 mL of the TRIzol solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 X g for 10 minutes at 4 C to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate RNA following the manufacturer protocol. The isolated RNA was then purified on column with DNAse I (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valenica, CA). The purified RNA was eluted in 50 uL H2O. Concentration of RNA was measured using the Qubit 3 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with Qubit RNA BR kit. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA Cat # 4456739, v92) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 was added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol.     RNA ribo depletion was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold. Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN > 4. Index adapters were 1.5 uM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size ~300 bp was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured by Universal qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control was determined by iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Paired end 149bp. PhiX included as control.     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 96, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads from 3 samples were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward. Raw RSEM count data were re-processed through normalization and DGE analysis as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md) Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0). The data was normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis.html report. *ERCC-normalized data are available upon request.",

All the animals from which the samples were sequenced in this dataset received two sham treatment in ISS: on Launch+6 days (L+6 days), vehicle control treatment (0.3mL of PBS) was administered intraperitoneally. The second treatment was administered two weeks after launch with vehicle control injection (0.3mL of PBS) followed by 0.1 mL of Calcein (bone marker).  Upon live animal return, mice were transported to the PI's UCLA lab on July 4th, 2017.  Upon arrival, a behaviroal test was performed and Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scan was performed while the animals were anesthestized by ketamine/xylazine. Upon completion of the scan, the mice received an injection of 0.2mL Atipamezole to allow recovery. The third treatment was administered with vehicle treatment (0.3mL of PBS) followed by 0.1 mL of Alizarin Red (bone marker). At around six weeks after launch, the fourth treatment was administered with vehicle control injection (0.3mL of PBS) followed by 0.1 mL of Calcein (bone marker). The animals were housed in the vivarium cages for around 30 days until experiment termination. The last DXA scan was performed right before termination.  Ground controls were conducted on a 3-day delay at Kennedy Space Center in ISS Environmental Simulators (ISSES) programmed with data from the Dragon capsule and the ISS cabin. The ground control animals received the same treatments as flight animals. After ~30 days housing in the Rodent Habitat, the ground control animals were shipped from KSC to PI's UCLA lab and were housed for 30 days in the vivarium cages until experiment termination.     Mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine. Dissection was performed at UCLA.  Skin tissues used for extraction were preserved in RNAlater after dissection and stored at -80C. The frozen preserved skin tissues were shipped frozen to NASA Ames Research Center and handled by BSP and LSDA.     RNA was extracted using the modified Trizol protocol from Dr. Masahiro Terada. Frozen skin, approximately 60 mg weight, were cut into small pieces. Transfered cut pieces into tube containing 1.6 mL cold Trizol. Samples were homogenized for 20 seconds at 21,000 rpm using a Polytron PT1300D (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY) handheld homogenizer with 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip. Homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 10 minutes at 4C to remove cell debris. Supernatant from each sample was split into 2 technical replicates and used to isolate RNA. Chloroform was added for phase separation and RNA was captured using isopropyl alcohol and Ethachinmate(Fujifilm Wako Chemicals). RNA was washed twice with 75% ethanol and eluted in 20 uL of RNase-free water. Eluted technical replicates were combined. Concentration of RNA was measured using the Qubit 3 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with Qubit RNA BR kit.

Six days after launch half of the mice were treated with NELL-1 (10 mg/kg in 0.3 ml PBS), while the other half were treated with vehicle control (0.3 ml PBS). Fourteen days after launch animals were again treated with NELL-1 or vehicle control as before, except that all animals were also injected with the bone marker, calcein green (20 mg/kg in 0.1 ml). Injections of vehicle, NELL-1, and bone markers were intraperitoneal. After all forty mice on orbit received two treatments; ten control mice and ten experimental mice were randomly selected for live animal return (LAR). At approximately 30 days after launch the twenty LAR mice were transported live back to Earth. Animals were allowed to recover for 30 days in standard habitats before euthanasia via intraperitoneal injection with ketamine/xylazine. During the recovery, the animals received another two treatments. GeneLab received RNA later preserved femoral skin from nine live animal return and ten matching ground control mice. These were from the vehicle control animals only. RNA was extracted, libraries generated (stranded, ribodepleted) and sequenced (target 60 M clusters at PE 150 bp).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "A cohort of 30 weeks-old female BALB/c mice (Taconic) were flown to the ISS on June 3rd, 2017 and were housed in the Rodent Habitat for around 30 days before returned to earth alive. All the animals from which the samples were sequenced in this dataset received two sham treatment in ISS: on Launch+6 days (L+6 days), vehicle control treatment (0.3mL of PBS) was administered intraperitoneally. The second treatment was administered two weeks after launch with vehicle control injection (0.3mL of PBS) followed by 0.1 mL of Calcein (bone marker).  Upon live animal return, mice were transported to the PI's UCLA lab on July 4th, 2017.  Upon arrival, a behaviroal test was performed and Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scan was performed while the animals were anesthestized by ketamine/xylazine. Upon completion of the scan, the mice received an injection of 0.2mL Atipamezole to allow recovery. The third treatment was administered with vehicle treatment (0.3mL of PBS) followed by 0.1 mL of Alizarin Red (bone marker). At around six weeks after launch, the fourth treatment was administered with vehicle control injection (0.3mL of PBS) followed by 0.1 mL of Calcein (bone marker). The animals were housed in the vivarium cages for around 30 days until experiment termination. The last DXA scan was performed right before termination.  Ground controls were conducted on a 3-day delay at Kennedy Space Center in ISS Environmental Simulators (ISSES) programmed with data from the Dragon capsule and the ISS cabin. The ground control animals received the same treatments as flight animals. After ~30 days housing in the Rodent Habitat, the ground control animals were shipped from KSC to PI's UCLA lab and were housed for 30 days in the vivarium cages until experiment termination.     Mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine. Dissection was performed at UCLA.  Skin tissues used for extraction were preserved in RNAlater after dissection and stored at -80C. The frozen preserved skin tissues were shipped frozen to NASA Ames Research Center and handled by BSP and LSDA.     RNA was extracted using the modified Trizol protocol from Dr. Masahiro Terada. Frozen skin, approximately 60 mg weight, were cut into small pieces. Transfered cut pieces into tube containing 1.6 mL cold Trizol. Samples were homogenized for 20 seconds at 21,000 rpm using a Polytron PT1300D (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY) handheld homogenizer with 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip. Homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 10 minutes at 4C to remove cell debris. Supernatant from each sample was split into 2 technical replicates and used to isolate RNA. Chloroform was added for phase separation and RNA was captured using isopropyl alcohol and Ethachinmate(Fujifilm Wako Chemicals). RNA was washed twice with 75% ethanol and eluted in 20 uL of RNase-free water. Eluted technical replicates were combined. Concentration of RNA was measured using the Qubit 3 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with Qubit RNA BR kit. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA Cat # 4456739, v92) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added immediately after RNA extractions at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol.     RNA ribo depletion was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold. Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN > 4. Index adapters were 1.5 uM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size ~300 bp was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured by Universal qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control was determined by iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Paired end 149bp. PhiX included as control.     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 96, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads from 3 samples were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.0.3) with tximport (version 1.18.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.30.0). The data was normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.30.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.2.0), PANTHER.db (v1.0.10), and org.Mm.eg.db (v3.12.0).",

          "Study Description": "The objective of the Rodent Research-5 (RR-5) study was to evaluate bone loss in mice during spaceflight and to determine if treatment with a modified version of NEL-like molecule-1 (NELL-1) can reduce or prevent bone loss that would otherwise occur during spaceflight. To this end, a cohort of forty 30-weeks-old female BALB/cAnNTac mice were flown to the ISS and housed in the Rodent Habitat. Six days after launch half of the mice were treated with NELL-1 (10 mg/kg in 0.3 ml PBS), while the other half were treated with vehicle control (0.3 mls PBS). Fourteen days after launch animals were again treated with NELL-1 or vehicle control as before, except that all animals were also injected with the bone marker, calcein green (20 mg/kg in 0.1 ml). Injections of vehicle, NELL-1, and bone markers were intraperitoneal. After all forty mice on orbit received two treatments; ten control mice and ten experimental mice were randomly selected for live animal return (LAR). At approximately 30 days after launch the twenty LAR mice were transported live back to Earth. Animals were allowed to recover for 30 days in standard habitats before euthanasia via intraperitoneal injection with ketamine/xylazine. During the recovery, the animals received another two treatments. GeneLab received RNA later preserved dorsal skin from ten live animal return and ten matching ground control mice. These were from the vehicle control animals only. RNA was extracted, libraries generated (stranded, ribodepleted) and sequenced (target 60 M clusters at PE 150 bp).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "A cohort of 9 weeks-old male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Labs) were flown to the ISS and housed in the Habitat Cage Units (HCUs).   Spaceflight: 12 mice (male, C57BL/6J) were acclimated for 3 weeks at KSC before launch on SpaceX-12 to the International Space Station (ISS). Fecal sampling and one blood draw were performed before flight. Mice were transported singly to the ISS in JAXA Transportation Cage Units (TCUs) and singly housed on ISS in JAXA Habitat Cage Units (HCUs) in the Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF) in the Kibo module. The JAXA Glove Box was used for transfer between TCUs and HCUs and for cage maintenance. 6 mice were kept in microgravity (F1-F3, F7-F9) and 6 centrifuged at 1G (F4-F6, F10-F12). 3 mice from each gravity group were fed normal JAXA chow; the other 3 mice from each gravity group were fed food containing fructooligosaccharides (FOS). During the ~30 days that the mice were maintained on the ISS, the crew performed cage maintenance including food and water refills and cage cleaning, performed daily health checks, sampled feces twice, and tested blood sampling in spaceflight using tail snips (on four mice: F1, F6, F9 and F10). It was noted that water leakage occured inside one TCU during return. All 12 mice were returned alive in TCUs in the SpaceX-12 Dragon capsule and transported to Explora BioLabs in San Diego for dissection.   Ground control: The ground control at Tsukuba Space Center was asynchronous and began after completion of the flight experiment. 12 mice (male, C57BL/6J) were acclimatized for three weeks and then housed for 5 days in TCUs to simulate the period from pre-launch loading through ISS berthing. Six of them were then housed for 30 days in ground HCUs and the other six were housed in the vivarium cages before being transferred back to TCUs for ~5 days of return simulation and then dissection. Three ground control and three vivarium animals received standard chow, while the other three each ground control and vivarium animals received FOS-supplemented chow.     Mice were euthanized and dissected immediately after returning to Earth. Multiple tissues, including the skin tissues, were collected from each animal. Dorsal skin was dissected 30 minutes after euthanasia and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The skin tissues were shipped frozen to NASA Ames Research Center and handled by BSP and LSDA. Ground and vivarium samples were dissected by a separate dissection team than spaceflight samples.     RNA was extracted using the modified Trizol protocol from Dr. Masahiro Terada.

Twelve 16-18 week old male C57BL/6J mice were singly housed in the JAXA Habitat Cage Units (HCUs) on the ISS for 30 days. Six flight mice were housed in microgravity, while six were exposed to simulated 1g by centrifugation. These two flight groups were further divided in half so that three mice in each group received standard JAXA chow, while the other three were fed chow supplemented with fructooligosaccharides (FOS). Mice were returned live and euthanized and dissected <1 day after splashdown. Ground controls (n=6) were asynchronous and housed in HCUs. Vivarium controls (n=6) were asynchronous and housed in standard habitats. Three ground control and three vivarium animals received standard chow, while the other three each ground control and vivarium animals received FOS-supplemented chow.

          "Study Protocol Description": "RNA was extracted using the modified Trizol protocol from Dr. Masahiro Terada. Frozen skin, approximately 60 mg weight, were cut into small pieces. Transfered cut pieces into tube containing 1.6 mL cold Trizol.  Samples were homogenized for 20 seconds at 21,000 rpm using a Polytron PT1300D (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY) handheld homogenizer with 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip. Homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 10 minutes at 4C to remove cell debris. Supernatant from each sample was split into 2 technical replicates and used to isolate RNA. Chloroform was added for phase separation and RNA was captured using isopropyl alcohol and Ethachinmate(Fujifilm Wako Chemicals). RNA was washed twice with 75% ethanol and eluted in 20 uL of RNase-free water. Eluted technical replicates were combined. Concentration of RNA was measured using the Qubit 3 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with Qubit RNA BR kit. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA Cat # 4456739, v92) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added immediately after RNA extractions at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol.     RNA ribo depletion was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold. Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN > 4. Index adapters were 1.5 uM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed.  Library fragment size ~300 bp was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured by Universal qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA).  Library quality control was determined by iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Paired end 149bp. PhiX included as control.     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 96, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads from 3 samples were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. The data were normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor*. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis.html report. *ERCC-normalized data are available upon request.     A cohort of 9 weeks-old male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Labs) were flown to the ISS and housed in the Habitat Cage Units (HCUs).   Spaceflight: 12 mice (male, C57BL/6J) were acclimated for 3 weeks at KSC before launch on SpaceX-12 to the International Space Station (ISS). Fecal sampling and one blood draw were performed before flight. Mice were transported singly to the ISS in JAXA Transportation Cage Units (TCUs) and singly housed on ISS in JAXA Habitat Cage Units (HCUs) in the Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF) in the Kibo module. The JAXA Glove Box was used for transfer between TCUs and HCUs and for cage maintenance. 6 mice were kept in microgravity (F1-F3, F7-F9) and 6 centrifuged at 1G (F4-F6, F10-F12). 3 mice from each gravity group were fed normal JAXA chow; the other 3 mice from each gravity group were fed food containing fructooligosaccharides (FOS). During the ~30 days that the mice were maintained on the ISS, the crew performed cage maintenance including food and water refills and cage cleaning, performed daily health checks, sampled feces twice, and tested blood sampling in spaceflight using tail snips (on four mice: F1, F6, F9 and F10). It was noted that water leakage occured inside one TCU during return. All 12 mice were returned alive in TCUs in the SpaceX-12 Dragon capsule and transported to Explora BioLabs in San Diego for dissection.   Ground control: The ground control at Tsukuba Space Center was asynchronous and began after completion of the flight experiment. 12 mice (male, C57BL/6J) were acclimatized for three weeks and then housed for 5 days in TCUs to simulate the period from pre-launch loading through ISS berthing. Six of them were then housed for 30 days in ground HCUs and the other six were housed in the vivarium cages before being transferred back to TCUs for ~5 days of return simulation and then dissection. Three ground control and three vivarium animals received standard chow, while the other three each ground control and vivarium animals received FOS-supplemented chow.     Mice were euthanized and dissected immediately after returning to Earth. Multiple tissues, including the skin tissues, were collected from each animal. Femoral skin was dissected 40 minutes after euthanasia and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The skin tissues were shipped frozen to NASA Ames Research Center and handled by BSP and LSDA. Ground and vivarium samples were dissected by a separate dissection team than spaceflight samples.",

Twelve 16-18 week old male C57BL/6J mice were singly housed in the JAXA Habitat Cage Units (HCUs) on the ISS for 30 days. Six flight mice were housed in microgravity, while six were exposed to simulated 1g by centrifugation. These two flight groups were further divided in half so that three mice in each group received standard JAXA chow, while the other three were fed chow supplemented with fructooligosaccharides (FOS). Mice were returned live and euthanized and dissected <1 day after splashdown. Ground controls (n=6) were asynchronous and housed in HCUs. Vivarium controls (n=6) were asynchronous and housed in standard habitats. Three ground control and three vivarium animals received standard chow, while the other three each ground control and vivarium animals received FOS-supplemented chow. Ground and vivarium samples were dissected by a separate dissection team than flight samples. Femoral skin was dissected 30 minutes after euthanasia and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.

          "Study Protocol Description": "A cohort of 10 week-old male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory) were launched in one Transporter (10 mice per side), transferred to Rodent Habitats onboard the International Space Station (ISS) and maintained in microgravity for ~33 days (the SpaceX Dragon docked period). No crew activities were required except for standard animal transfers between the Transporter and Habitats, and other activities required to ensure animal welfare, such as health checks and NuRFB replenishments.    Prior to Dragon unberth, all mice were transferred into a clean Transporter followed by transfer to a Dragon capsule and then returned to Earth alive. The duration from splashdown to handover of the mice payload at the pier was approximately 24 hours. After handover of mice to the NASA Rodent Research team, the mice were immediately transported to the animal facility at Loma Linda University for conducting post-flight rodent gait assessment and dissections. The primary investigator teams, BSP teams, and Rodent Research dissection Lead and team conducted the dissection process at LLU immediately following a health check and specimen sampling and acquisition of walking kinematic data and intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements.  A Basal Control (BSL) was housed in standard cages at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and euthanized one day after launch of the FLT animals. Ground Control (GC) and Vivarium Control (VIV) studies were planned to commence at KSC approximately one-week after the conclusion of the flight experiments.  Early termination of RR-9 Ground Control (GC): Due to Hurricane Irma in September 2017 in Florida, the RR9 GC experiments were prematurely terminated. The experiment was repeated in May 2018 using the same strain of mice that was used for the flight experiment to match with flight animals. Besides Ground Control and Vivarium groups, an additional group of animals was used as Cohort Controls (Cohort Control #2) to normalize the variation due to differences in the cohorts.  Cohort control #1 and #2 animals (CC) were not provided with the rodent food bars, lixits, or raised wire floors.     Mice were euthanized, upon live animal return and dissected immediately. Each carcass dissection time was no longer than 1 hour from collection of the first tissue. Multiple tissues, including the liver tissue, were collected from each carcass.     RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. After thawing on ice, approximately 30 mg of tissue was isolated using a scalpel, weighed and immediately placed in 600 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 20,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at RT and at 14,000 X g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 uL H2O. Concentration for all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).

          "Study Description": "The objective of the Rodent Research-9 (RR-9) mission was to use mice to understand the molecular basis of phenomena that affect astronauts during long-duration spaceflight, particularly visual impairment and joint tissue degradation. To this end, a flight group (FLT) of 10 week-old male C57BL/6J mice were launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on 8/14/2017 and housed in Rodent Habitats on the ISS for 33 days before being returned alive to Earth. After splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, the animals were transported to Loma Linda University (LLU) for testing, euthanasia and dissection on 9/18/2018. A Basal Control (BSL) was housed in standard cages at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and euthanized one day after launch of the FLT animals (8/15/2017). Ground Control (GC) and Vivarium Control (VIV) studies were planned to commence at KSC approximately one-week after the conclusion of the flight experiments. However, all the GC and VIV mouse studies at KSC had to be cancelled due to Hurricane Irma and potential adverse effects on the animal housing facility. The GC and VIV studies were therefore rescheduled and begun in May, 2018. The GC was euthanized and dissected 6/18/2018 - 6/20/2018, while the VIV was euthanized and dissected 6/22/2018 - 6/23/2018. Because this resulted in a different cohort of mice being used for the GC and VIV controls as compared to the flight (FLT) and basal (BSL) groups, two cohort controls were included in the study. The first, Cohort Control 1 (CC_C1), was from the same cohort as the FLT and BSL animals, and was sacrificed and dissected 4 days after the FLT group (9/22/2017). The second, Cohort Control 2 (CC_C2), was from the same cohort as the GC and VIV animals, and was sacrificed and dissected 2-8 days after the GC and VIV groups, (6/24/2018 - 6/26/2018). The CC_C1 and CC_C2 groups were housed in standard cages and fed standard chow in contrast to all other groups which received Rodent Foodbars. To clarify the connections between treatment groups and animal cohorts, the following group abbreviations are used in the sample metadata: Flight (FLT_C1); Basal (BSL_C1); Ground Control (GC_C2); Vivarium Control (VIV_C2), Cohort Control 1 (CC_C1); Cohort Control 2 (CC_C2). Upon dissection, livers were preserved in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 C before RNA was extracted, libraries generated (stranded, ribodepleted) and sequenced (target 60 M clusters at PE 150 bp).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Three weeks prior to launch (L-21d), 100 mice (5 weeks old) were delivered from Jackson Lab to KSC. Then the 100 mice were acclimatized to the environment for three weeks in individual housing cages (Small Mouse Isolator 10027, Lab Products Inc., USA) in an air-conditioned room (temperature: 23+/-3C; humidity: 40-65%) with a 12:12-h light-dark cycle at the SSPF Science Annex at KSC. Three acclimation phases were set: Phase I, body weight recovery phase (L-21d to L-14d); Phase II, water nozzle acclimation (L-14d to L-7d) and Phase III, flight food acclimation (L-7d to launch). After approximately three weeks of acclimation, the mice were ready for transport and reached the age of 8 weeks. Briefly, at Phase I, mice were fed CRF-1 and given water ad libitum using ball-type water nozzles. The drinking water was autoclaved tap water. The bedding material consisted of paper chips (ALPHA-DRI). At Phase II, water nozzles are changed to flight nozzles. Finally, at Phase III, the food was changed to flight food. Fecal collection and body swabs were obtained at L-13d, and these samples were sent to Charles River Laboratories in the USA for PCR-based SPF testing.  During the acclimation phase, body weight and food/water consumption were measured and recorded. Four days prior to launch (L-4d), 78 mice were devided into six subgroups of 13 mice (12 mice for flight and one backup mouse for contingencies such as ear punching failure). The selection of flight candidate mice was based on body weight, food consumption and water intake. Health of each flight candidate mouse was checked by evaluating the condition of their eyes, ears, teeth, fur and tail. The six subgroups were necessary to support possible launch attempts in case of unexpected postponements.     Five-week-old C57BL/6J male mice (Stock #000664) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories (USA) for the space experiment and from the Charles River Laboratories (Japan) for ground experiments. One day prior to launch (L-1d), 12 mice at 8 weeks of age were loaded into the TCU and made ready for launch. Flight mice were launched to space on board the SpX9 on 18 July 2016 (EDT) from the KSC. After arriving at the ISS, mice were relocated from the TCU to the HCU by the crew, where the animals were housed for 35 days. Before mice were returned to the ground, centrifugation was halted and they were transferred to the SpX9 Dragon capsule. The capsule splashed down in the Pacific Ocean offshore from California on 26 August 2016 (GMT). Following splashdown, the TCU containing mice was unloaded from the SpX9 Dragon capsule and transported to Long Beach Airport on 28 August 2016 (GMT). The TCU was handed over to JAXA at the airport and then transported to a laboratory in San Diego (Explora Biolabs) by an environmentally controlled van. Returned mice were euthanized and dissected at the laboratory to collect tissues.  The HCU was equipped with a food bar, watering system (two redundant water nozzles and a water balloon acting as power-free pressure source), an odour filter, two fans (for redundancy) for air ventilation, waste collecting equipment, an LED/IR video camera with a wiper inside the cage to keep the observation window clean. Paper sheets were mounted on the cage wall to quickly eliminate liquid from the cage, such as urine. A photocatalytic thermal spray was applied to the sheets for deodorising and antibacterial effects. Air ventilation inside the cage was maintained by airflow (<0.2m/s) generated by fans on the HCU. Differences in the volume of air ventilation and airflow rate between HCU in artificial and microgravity conditions is negligible because the fans regulating ventilation in both gravity conditions are maintained at the same speed. The day/night cycle uses 12h intervals.  Feed and water resupply are required once a week. Logs of temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide and ammonia can be monitored. The TCU was used to transport mice aboard the SpaceX Dragon space vehicle in the launch and return phases, and it was placed in a powered locker sized for ISS single cargo transfer. The TCU contains 12 cylindrical cages for housing mice individually. The TCU is equipped with a cylindrical food bar, watering system (two redundant water nozzles and a water balloon), an odour philtre, two fans (for redundancy), waste collecting equipment and LEDs with lights for day and night cycles. Paper sheets mounted in the waste collection area were treated with photocatalytic thermal spray for deodorising and antibacterial effects, similar to the HCU. A temperature/humidity logger was attached on the TCU air inlet to monitor the environment during subsequent operations.     After unberthing from the ISS, the Dragon vehicle splashed down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California. After a ship picked up the cargo, the returned TCU was transported to a port in Long Beach. JAXA later received the TCU from NASA and transported it to Explora Biolabs in San Diego for analysis. The health and body weights of mice were checked. Isoflurane-anesthetised mice were euthanized by exsanguination and dissected for the collection of tissue samples.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://www.nasa.gov/reference/osdr-environmental-data/.     Total RNA was extracted using TRIZOL reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The quality of isolated total RNA was evaluated by using the RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).     The RNA-Seq library was prepared from 50ng of RNA by using the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs (NEB), Ipswich, MA) after the depletion of rRNA (NEB NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit).     Paired-end sequencing (PE36bp) was performed with NextSeq500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) at Tsukuba i-Laboratory LLP (Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan).     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.1) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.0 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.0/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Retina tissues (n of 8/group) were homogenized with Precellys CKM beads (Hilden, Germany) in 600ul of RLT plus buffer. Total RNA and DNA were extracted using the QIAGEN AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. After isolation, RNA and DNA were frozen and kept at -80C until further use. Isolated RNA samples were quantified and purity checked by NanoDrop spectrophotometry (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Chino, CA). DNA and RNA were further quantified using the Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Kit and RNA Broad Range Kit, respectively (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). RNA quality was evaluated using the Agilent 2200 TapeStation and RNA ScreenTape with 1ul of randomly selected RNA denatured at 72C for three minutes per manufacturer's instructions (Santa Clara, CA). RNA integrity numbers (RIN) of tested RNA samples had values between 7.7 and 8.9.     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) Mix 2 were added immediately after RNA extractions at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol.     The Ovation Mouse RNA-Seq System 1-16 (NuGEN Technologies,  0348) was used per manufacturer's instructions to construct stranded RNA-seq libraries. 100ng of total RNA was used as input. First and second strands of cDNA were synthesized from total RNA (100ng) spiked with 1 ul of 1:500 diluted ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mix 2 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) at the appropriate ratio. Following primer annealing and cDNA synthesis, the products were sheared using Covaris S220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA). 130ul of each sample was sheared according to manufacturer;s instructions. The parameters were set as follows: 10% duty factor, peak power 175 and 200 cycles per burst at 4C for 200 seconds to obtain fragment sizes between 150 to200bp. This was followed by end-repair, adaptor index ligation and strand selection. Strand selection was performed by using custom InDA-C primer mixture SS5 Version5 for mice with cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomal RNA depletion. Finally, libraries were amplified using 17 cycles (Mastercycler pro, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), and purified with RNAClean XP Agencourt beads. The final amplified libraries were purified using Agencourt RNAClean XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN) and quantified using Qubit dsDNA HS Kit on Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Quality and peak size was determined using D1000 ScreenTape on the Agilent 2200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     Final libraries were each diluted to 4nM and further quantitated to ensure high accuracy quantification for consistent pooling of barcoded libraries and maximization of the number of clusters in the Illumina flow cell. Libraries of different indices were pooled for sequencing together in equimolar amounts. Pooled libraries were quantified by Qubit prior to sequencing. For sequencing, clusters were generated on cBot with HiSeq3000/4000 PE cluster kit (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) from 5ul of 2nM final library pool (200 pM at cBot loading). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq4000 (Loma Linda University Center for Genomics) using 75 cycles SBS reagents (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). Single-indexed and single-end reads with 75 nucleotides length (1 x 75bp) were generated.     Fastq files generated from the sequence run were demultiplexed (Loma Linda University Center for Genomics), quality checked (quality score greater than 38), trimmed from adapters with Trimmomatic (version 0.01) and mapped against mouse reference genome (NCBI_build_37.2) with TOPHAT2 (version 2). Overall mapping rate was ~85%. Expressed transcripts were counted with Multi HTSeq (version 0.02). Differential Expression analysis was carried out using raw counts from input to the R package DEseq2 Version 1.22.2 using R version 3.5.1. A gene was considered differentially expressed (DE) if was below a false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p-value of 0.1.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.3 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.3/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. The data were normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor*. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis.html report.\n\n*ERCC-normalized data are available upon request.     SpaceX successfully launched the 12th Commercial Resupply Service (CRS-12) payload at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a 35-day mission in August, 2017. 10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (n of 20) (Jackson laboratories, Inc. Bar harbor, ME) were flown for NASA's ninth Rodent Research experiment (RR-9). The mice lived in NASA's Rodent Habitats (RH) aboard ISS for 35 days before returning to Earth via SpaceX's Dragon capsule. All mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26 to 28 C with a 12-h light/dark cycle during the flight. GC mice were placed into the same housing hardware used in flight, and environmental parameters such as temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels were matched as closely as possible based on telemetry data. GC mice were fed the same special NASA food bar diet as the space flown mice. All mice received the same ad libitum access to food and water. The study followed the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Loma Linda University (LLU) and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Upon return to the Earth, mice were transported to Loma Linda University (LLU) within 28 hours of splashdown. At LLU, animals were removed from the animal enclosure hardware and assessed for survival and health. It was reported that all the mice survived the 35-day space mission and were in good condition, i.e. no obvious deficiencies/abnormalities as described by the inspecting personnel.     The mice were rapidly euthanized in 100% CO2 and eyes were collected within 38+/- 4 hours of splashdown (n of 20/group). The retinas from rights were dissected and placed individually in sterile cryovials, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80C prior to use. The left eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 24 hours and then rinsed with PBS for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. The right eyes from 2 experimental groups: ground control and spaceflight (n of 8 mice per group) were dissected to obtain the retina. The retinas were flash-frozen and stored at -80C for genomic analysis.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "RNA was isolated using the MirVana RNA isolation kit (Life Technologies) and amplified by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase.      Analysis of microarray data was conducted using both Microarray Suite (MAS) version 5.0 and Robust Multi-Array Average (RMA) 22. Differentially expressed genes were > -2 (decrease) or a fold change of > 2 (increase) with a FDR of 0.05.      Samples (100ng) were labeled using the Affymetrix GeneChip WT Plus protocol.      Samples were hybridized to an Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Gene Chip.      C57BL/6N male mice were flown for 30 days (477 Earth orbits) on the unmanned BION-M1 biosatellite between 19 April and 19 May 2013. Tissues were acquired from six male flight mice as part of NASA x92s Biospecimen Sharing Program. The mice were specific pathogen-free and 19 x9620 weeks old at the time of launch and start of control experiments. In addition to the six flight mice (SF) there were eight  x93flight x94 vivarium male ground control mice (SFV) seven asynchronous ground control males (GC) and seven asynchronous vivarium ground control males (GCV). Tissues were harvested 12 x9613 h post-landing. Hindlimbs and elbow joints were dissected and right limbs placed in RNALater (Ambion) with left limbs placed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin (NBF). Sternae with ribs attached were cut mid-sternum and the posterior half containing xiphoid process and two sternocostal joints placed in RNALater and the anterior half placed in NBF for histology. RNALater-preserved articular cartilage (AC) from the femoral condyle and proximal tibia was dissected down to the calcified zone using an ophthalmic scalpel and tissue from spaceflight (SF) and ground control (GC) animals pooled separately. Half sternum pieces were dissected from sternal cartilage (SC) dissected from bony segments and pooled.     On-board dosimetry details including schematics are available at: https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/environmental/radiation/BION-M1/. Summary dosimetry is given per sample.

Liver samples were obtained through the NASA Biospecimen Sharing Program.",
          "Study Protocol Description": "On July 8, 2011, age- and weight-matched female C57BL/6NCrl mice (n equals15/group) were placed into three Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs, 2 groups of 5 per AEM separated by a wire mesh) and flown on the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) for 13 days. There were two sets of ground controls housed at the Space Life Science Laboratory (SLSL) at KSC. Due to the nature of the NASA BSP program, we did not receive tissues from all mice for all assays. Ground AEM control mice were placed into the same hardware used in flight and environmental parameters such as temperature and CO2 levels were matched as closely as possible based on 48-hour delayed telemetry data. Conditions were controlled for temperature, humidity, and a 12:12 hr light:dark cycle; food (food bars developed by NASA Ames) and water was provided ad libitum. Vivarium control mice were housed in standard shoebox cages and fed standard rodent chow. Vivarium mice were used to normalize cell counts, minimizing day-to-day variability.     Mice were euthanized and dissected within 3-5 hours of landing. As part of the primary science, all mice underwent dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) densitometry (Piximus, Inc., Fitchburg, WI) immediately prior to anesthesia and euthanization. Mice were anesthetized with 3-5% isoflurane and euthanized with 100% CO2 and exsanguination. These studies were approved by the NASA Ames and University of Colorado at Boulder Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs).  Tissues were harvested, weighed, and processed at the KSC. Cerebellum tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen at the time of dissection and stored at -80C until analysis.  Due to the nature of the NASA BSP program, we did not receive tissues from all mice for all assays.     The absorbed dose from ionizing radiation received by the flight specimens was estimated using TLD passive dosimeters located in the middeck of the space shuttle, where the payload was located. More specifically, we computed the average between three dosimeters (DLOC1, DLOC2, and DLOC3) for the mission and we divided it by the total duration of the mission to estimate the average absorbed dose rate in mGy/day. This dose rate did not include any shielding effects from the hardware where the specimens resided. The total absorbed dose in water was then computed by simply multiplying the average dose rate with the duration of the experiment. The duration of the experiment was defined as the time in space during which the specimen was living. Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. A table with these detailed computations for all space shuttle datasets is available on GeneLab at https://www.nasa.gov/reference/osdr-environmental-data/. The ground samples were not assessed for radiation exposure.     RNA isolation was performed using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc. Valencia, CA) as per the manufacturer's instructions. A maximum of 30-mg frozen cerebellum tissue was used.   Target Preparation/Processing for GeneChip Analysis: After isolation, RNA was frozen at -80C and shipped on dry ice to the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Genomics High-Throughput Facility (GHTF) for further analysis. The following protocol was provided by the UCI GHTF. Isolated total RNA samples were processed as recommended by Affymetrix, Inc. (Affymetrix GeneChip Whole Transcript Sense Target Labeling Assay Manual, Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). In brief, total RNA was initially isolated as described above and then put through an RNeasy spin column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) for further clean up. Eluted total RNAs were quantified by NanoDrop (ThermoScientific, Wilmington, DE) and the concentrations of sample aliquots were adjusted to 100 ng/ul. Total RNA samples were assessed for quality prior to performing target preparation/processing steps by loading approximately 25-250 ng of each sample onto a RNA 6000 Nano LabChip, which was evaluated on an Agilent Biolanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA).     The Ambion whole transcript (WT) expression kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) was used to prepare RNA samples for whole transcriptome microarray analysis. Briefly, random hexamers that were tagged with a T7 promoter were used in first strand synthesis of cDNA. Then, using the T7 promoter, second strand synthesis was performed and the double-stranded cDNA was subsequently used as a template in an in vitro transcription reaction to generate many copies of antisense cRNA. Ten 10 ug of antisense cRNA was input into a second cycle cDNA reaction using reverse transcriptase and random hexamers to produce single- stranded DNA in the sense orientation. The single-stranded DNA was fragmented to an average length of 70 bases and then labeled using a recombinant terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and an Affymetrix proprietary DNA labeling reagent that was covalently linked to biotin.     Two ug of the labeled, fragmented single-stranded cDNA was hybridized at 45C with rotation for 17 hours (Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640) to probe sets present on an Affymetrix GeneChip 1.0ST array. The GeneChip arrays were washed and then stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin on an Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 (Fluidics protocol FS450_007).     Arrays were scanned using GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G and Command Console Software v. 3.2.3 to produce .CEL intensity files.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "The femurs from Flight (n=4), recovery (n=4) and Ground control (n=5) mice were analysed individually. Frozen mid distal part of right femurs were weighed and grinded using a ball mill (2 x 30 s @ 25 Hz; MM400, Retsch) under liquid nitrogen and proteins were extracted using 10 volumes (i.e. 10 uL/mg of tissue) of extraction buffer (8 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 2% CHAPS, 2% DTT, 50 mM Tris pH 8.8, protease inhibitors). After solubilisation for 30 min at 37C,\nsamples were centrifuged (5 min, 4C, 15000 x g) to remove possible cell/tissue debris. After\nTCA-precipitation of proteins overnight at 4C and a centrifugation (10 min, 4C, 15000 x g),\npelleted proteins were washed using cold acetone and re-solubilised in the extraction buffer\nwithout reducing agents and detergents. Protein concentration was then determined by a\nBradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). At this stage, a sample pool comprising equal\namounts of all protein extracts was made, to be repeatedly analysed during the whole\nduration of nanoLC-MS/MS experiments to allow QC-related measurements. Reproducibility\nof protein electrophoretic profiles was checked for all protein extracts after dilution of 30 ug\nof proteins in Laemmli buffer (10mM Tris pH 6.8, 1mM EDTA, 5% beta-mercapto-ethanol, 5% SDS, 10% glycerol, bromophenol blue), denaturation at 95C, and SDS-Page electrophoresis on 12% acrylamide gels.     30 ug of each protein extract were mixed with 4x SDS sample buffer (1x: 50 mM Tris pH 6.8, 1 mM EDTA, 5 % beta-mercapto-ethanol, 2.5 % SDS and 10 % glycerol), incubated at 95C for 5 minutes and run for 15 minutes at 35 V into a 4 % polyacrylamide stacking gel in order to let proteins enter approximately 12 mm into the gel. Electrophoresis was stopped at this point and gels were stained by Colloidal Coomassie Blue. Both the 'stacked' protein band and the\npart of the gel (separated into 3 slices) above this band were excised, with the stacked band being afterwards divided into 4 pieces and the 3 slices into 8 pieces each before in-gel digestion using an automatic pipetting device (MassPrep, Waters, Milford, MA). Following destaining, reduction (DTT) and alkylation (iodoacetamide), proteins were digested overnight at 37C using 300 ng of trypsin for the stacked band and 100 ng for slices coming from the upper part of the gel. Peptides were then extracted in 60 % acetonitrile/0.1 % formic acid in water for one hour then in 100 % acetonitrile (ACN) for 10 minutes at 450 rpm on an orbital shaker, and the three peptide extracts coming from the upper part of the gel were pooled. At this stage, a set of reference peptides (iRT kit; Biognosys AG, Schlieren, Switzerland) was added to each sample to enable following the stability of instrument performances (QC-related measurements). Just before LC-MS/MS analysis, the volume of peptide extracts was reduced in a speed-vac and sample volumes were adjusted to 60 il with 1% ACN, 0.1 % formic acid in water.\n\nSamples were analysed on a nanoUPLC-system (nanoAcquity, Waters) coupled to a quadrupole-Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer (Q-Exactive plus, Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA). Two ul of each sample were concentrated/desalted on a trap column (Symmetry C18, 180 um x 20 mm, 5 um; Waters) using 99 % of solvent A (0.1 % formic acid in water)/1 % solvent B (0.1 % formic acid in ACN) at a flow rate of five ul/min for 3 minutes. Afterwards, peptides were transferred and eluted from the separation column (BEH130 C18, 250 mm x 75 um, 1.7 um; Waters) maintained at 60C using a 150 minutes gradient from 1-40 % of B. All samples were injected using a randomized and blocked injection sequence (one biological replicate of each group plus the pool in each block). To minimize carry-over, a column wash (50% ACN during 20 minutes) was included in between each block in addition to a solvent blank injection, which was performed after each sample.\n\nThe Q-Exactive Plus was operated in positive ion mode with source temperature set to 250C and spray voltage to 1.8 kV. Full scan MS spectra (300-1800 m/z) were acquired at a resolution of 140,000 at m/ 200, a maximum injection time of 50 ms and an AGC target value of 3 x 106 charges with the lock-mass option being enabled (445.12002 m/z). Up to 10 most intense precursors per full scan were isolated using a 2 m/z window and fragmented using higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD, normalised collision energy of 27eV) and dynamic exclusion of already fragmented precursors was set to 60 sec. MS/MS spectra were acquired with a resolution of 17,500 at m/z 200, a maximum injection time of 100 ms and an AGC target value of 1 x 10^5. The system was fully controlled by the XCalibur software (v3.0.63; Thermo Fisher Scientific).     Space conditions included a cylindrical module habitat, which approx. volume was 1.7 l (3 mice per habitat, acclimatization during 3 days before launching), and a paste food diet based on standard chow with water and a casein gelling agent. All mice were exposed to 12-h light/dark cycles with mean (± S.D.) temperatures of 21.1 ± 0.4 C and 21.3 ± 0.8 C for flown mice and ground control animals, respectively. During their recovery period, mice were housed in standard conditions with a standard chow diet.\n\nC57/BL6 male mice (23 week-old) were launched on board the Bion-M1 biosatellite to be exposed to weightlessness during a 30-day spaceflight (∼570 km orbit).     Proteomics analysis was performed on the right femur of four mice euthanized by cervical dislocation 13-16 h after landing (Flight group), four mice put to death after a one-week recovery period on Earth (Recovery group) and five control mice retained on Earth under space housing and feeding conditions (Ground Control group). These femurs were dissected immediately after sacrifice and frozen at -80C until proteome analysis.",

          "Study Description": "Bone loss and immune dysregulation are among the main adverse outcomes of spaceflight challenging astronaut’s health and safety. However, consequences on B cell development and responses are still under-investigated. Up to now, most studies addressing these questions were performed using an amphibian species. Consequently, we used advanced proteomics analysis of femur bone and marrow of mice flown for one month on board the BION-M1 biosatellite, to determine whether extreme conditions encountered during a real spaceflight affect B cell development in mice and to examine reversibility of the effects upon return to Earth. Our data revealed that adverse effects on B lymphopoiesis were more marked one week after landing and that this phenomenon was associated with a 41% reduction of B cells in the spleen. Thus, the effects of spaceflight persisted during at least one week after landing. These reductions may contribute to explain increased susceptibility to infection even if we confirmed that animals were able to mount a humoral immune response.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Cerium oxide nanoparticles (nanoceria, Sigma 544841) were first dispersed at a concentration of 20 mg/ml in water, then they were incubated with 50% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco 10082147) for 30 min. Subsequently, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/ml NC dispersions with 10% FBS in CO2-independent medium (Gibco 18045088) were obtained for assessing antioxidant effect of nanoparticles by flow cytometry. These dispersions were finally ten-fold diluted in differentiation medium composed by CO2-independent medium at a final concentration of 1% FBS, with 1% insulin-transferrin-sodium selenite mixture (Sigma-Aldrich I3146), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco 25030149), 100 U/ml penicillin-100 ug/ml streptomycin (Gibco 15140122).\n\nH9c2 myoblasts (ATCC CRL 1446) at passage 6-12 were seeded at a density of 35,000 cells/cm2 on Thermanox coverslips (1x2.2 cm2, Nunc 174934). Kayser Italia Experiment Units (EUs, qualified for flight to the International Space Station) were loaded with cell culture media (100 ug/ml FBS-coated NC dispersion in one reservoir for two EUs), a saline solution (DPBS added with Ca2+/Mg2+) for cell rinse prior to fixation, and a fixative solution (RNAlater, Ambion AM7020) for nucleic acid stabilization. At day 1 after seeding, cell cultures were transferred to EUs, which were then positioned within Kayser Italia Experiment Containers (ECs) before being inserted into a soft pouch containing phase change materials pre-heated at 27C. An iButton data logger recorded the temperature every minute until the end of the experiment. The experimental hardware was delivered to flight authorities at day 2; it was launched on a Dragon / Falcon 9 vector in the framework of the SpaceX CRS-12 mission at day 4, and reached the ISS at day 7 after seeding. Once on board the ISS, the ECs were manually inserted by an astronaut in the Kubik incubator set at 37C, and the electronics was switched on. Fluidic activations were automatically performed at days 7, 8 and 9 after seeding. The last two activations were performed at day 10: in particular, fixation occurred after 5 min from rinse with saline solution. Samples were then manually transferred to MELFI refrigerator and stowed at -80C until re-entry.     Samples were thawed, retrieved from EUs and imaged by optical microscopy in phase contrast mode with a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope. Temperature profile was downloaded from data loggers on the ECs and was reproduced for experiment repetition on ground within six EUs (three treated with NC and three untreated) that were manually activated. Cell culture samples were positioned in 2 ml test tubes, covered with their supernatant (composed by 70% RNAlater fixative, 21% DPBS and 9% cell culture medium) and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 min. The supernatant was carefully removed, and a volume of 100 ul was left in the tubes so as not to perturb cells potentially precipitated after detachment from the substrate. MirVana PARIS kit (Ambion AM1556) was used for cell lysis, as well as for following RNA extraction and purification procedures. Ice-cold cell disruption buffer (250 ul) was pipetted directly on the Thermanox substrates holding the H9c2 cell cultures three times. Cell lysis was also promoted by vortexing for 30 s and by placing cultures on ice every 10 s. An equal volume of 1.5% beta-mercaptoethanol denaturing solution (350 ul) was added to each tube, and then the lysate was incubated on ice for 5 min. An equal volume of acid-phenol:chloroform solution (700 ul) was added to the lysate. Samples were thus vortexed for 1 min and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min. The aqueous phase (600 ul) from each sample was transferred to another clean tube, and was added with 1.25 volumes of 99.9% ethanol (750 ul). Each solution was then loaded on a filter cartridge positioned in a collection tube, and was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 30 s. The eluate was discarded, and 700 ul of complete miRNA Wash Solution 1 were added to each filter cartridge for centrifugation at 10,000 g for 30 s. The eluate was again discarded, and 500 ul of complete wash solution 2/3 were added to each filter cartridge for centrifugation at 10,000 g for 30 s (this step was repeated twice). The eluate was once again discarded, and the tubes were centrifuged for 1 min in order to fully remove the wash solution. Thereafter, filter cartridges were transferred to clean collection tubes, and RNA was eluted with 40 ul of RNAse-free water pre-heated at 90C. The tubes were incubated for 10 min and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 min. The eluate was used for RNA quality and yield assessment with NanoDrop spectrophotometer.     Gene expression was investigated with rat Clariom S Pico arrays (ThermoFisher Scientific 902936) by using 30 ng of total RNA for reverse transcription (with 500 pg of HeLa cell RNA as control), genomic reference Rnor_6.0. Reverse transcription was initiated at the poly-A tail and throughout the RNA length to ensure that both coding and multiple forms of non-coding RNA were captured. Complementary RNA (cRNA) amplification was obtained by low-cycle PCR followed by linear amplification through T7 in vitro transcription. Quantification of cRNA was performed with NanoDrop spectrophotometer. The cRNA (20 ug) was converted into biotinylated, double stranded cDNA (quantification reported in Supplementary Table 4), which was fragmented (all fragments were in the 25-200 nt range) and terminally labeled for hybridization to arrays.     Each RNA sample was spotted on a single chip; hybridized arrays were then stained, washed and scanned using a GeneChip Fluidics Station 450, Command Console Software and GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G, generating a .cel file for each array (ThermoFisher Scientific).     Images were scanned by Affymetrix GeneChip Command Console (ThermoFisher Scientific) and analyzed with the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Console (ThermoFisher Scientific). The quality of the scanned data was first estimated by confirming the order of signal intensities of the Poly-A and Hybridization controls using Expression Console Software (ThermoFisher Scientific).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "A cohort of 12-week-old female BALB/c mice were flown to the ISS and housed in the Rodent Habitat and were subjected to microgravity for 39-42 days. Mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. mice from the same cohort were dissected at time of launch and used as basal controls.  At the end of the mission, spaceflight and ground controls had blood collected, were euthanized and one hindlimb removed and whole carcasses were stored at -80 C until BSP (Biospecimen Sharing Program) dissection on earth. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). [Spaceflight and ground control mice- untreated, injected with control Ig-G (sham treated). Basal mice received no injections.]     Mouse carcasses were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes for dissection. Each carcass dissection time was no longer than 1 hour from collection of the first tissue. Multiple tissues, including the eye tissue, were collected from each carcass. Eye tissues were harvested and snap frozen in LN2, then stored separately in -80 C freezer for sample processing.  Frozen whole eye samples were sent to Dr. Vivien (Xiao) Mao at Loma Linda University for microdissection and RNA extraction.  Frozen whole eye samples were microdissected in ice-cold PBS.  Fine spring scissors were used to separate the cornea from the sclera to access the retina. The retina was carefully detached from the sclera. The retina, cornea, and lens were immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at -80 C until DNA/RNA isolation.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.     RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (Qiagen, Cat # 80224) by Loma Linda University. Frozen retinal tissues were homogenized in 600 ul of RLT lysis buffer containing 1 % beta-mercaptoethanol.  Tissue homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix (Tissue homogenizing CKMix, Precellys) on Minilys (Bertin Technologies).  Tubes were centrifuged for 1 min at 20, 000 g to reduce bubbles/foam.  The homogenized lysate was transferred to an AllPrep DNA Mini spin column placed in a 2 ml collection tube and centrifuged for 30 s at full speed (maximum speed of 20,000 x g).  The flow-through (containing the RNA) was transferred into a new 2 ml microcentrifuge for RNA purification. The AllPrep DNA Mini spin column (containing the DNA) was stored on ice for DNA purification.  80 ul Proteinase K was added to the flow-through (RNA) and mixed by pipetting.  350 ul of 100 % Ethanol was added and mixed and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature.  750 ul 100% ethanol was added and mixed.  700 ul of the sample was transferred to an RNeasy Mini spin column placed in a 2 ml collection tube and centrifuged for 15 s at 20,000 x g. This step was repeated until the entire sample passed through the column. The flow-through was discarded.  500 ul of Buffer RPE was added to the RNeasy Mini spin column, centrifuged for 15 s at full speed (20,000 x g) and the flow-through discarded.  10 u DNase I stock solution was diluted in 70 ul Buffer RDD mixed gently and the 80 ul incubation mix was added to the spin column and kept for 15 minutes at room temperature.  500 ul Buffer FRN was added to the RNeasy Mini spin column and centrifuged for 15 s at 20,000 x g.  The flow-through (containing small RNAS) was re-applied to the spin column and centrifuged.  The flow-through was then discarded.  500 ul Buffer RPE was then added to the RNeasy Mini spin column and centrifuged for 15 s at 20,000 x g.  500 ul of 100% ethanol was added to the RNeasy Mini spin column and centrifuged for 2 min at 20,000 x g.  The flow-through and the collection tube were discarded.  Centrifugation was repeated with new collection tubes.  The RNeasy Mini spin column was placed in a new 1.5 ml collection tube and 30 ul RNase-free water was added directly to the spin column membrane and centrifuged for 1 min at 10000 x g to elute the RNA.  The eluate was re-applied to the column and centrifuged again to increase the RNA yield from the column.  RNA concentration was measured using Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).  RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).  RNA stored at -80 C.     Frozen RNA aliquot was kept on dry ice for control addition.  ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA Cat # 4456739) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added to the sample tube at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol.  Samples were shipped on dry ice to omics core facility.     Sequencing library construction was performed by UC Davis Genome Center. RNA Ribo Depletion done with Illumina Ribo Zero Gold Human/Mouse/Rat.  Library Preps done with KAPA RNA stranded reagents.  10 cycles PCR done.     RNA sequencing performed on Illumina HiSeq 4000. Paired end 150bp. Performed at UC Davis Genome Center.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-June-2019. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8) and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data from raw fastq files through RSEM counts were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-B (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-B.md). Raw RSEM count data generate with GL-DPPD-7101-B, were re-processed through normalization and DGE analysis as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 96, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher ([https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip]). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0). The data were normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only group B ERCC genes to estimate the size factor. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb, PANTHER.db, and org.Mm.eg.db. Gene annotations were assigned using the GeneLab Reference Annotations pipeline ([https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md]), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).

On July 8, 2011, age- and weight-matched female C57BL/6CR mice (n=15/group) were placed into three Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs, 2 groups of 5 per AEM separated by a wire mesh) and flown on the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) for 13 days. There were two sets of ground controls housed at the Space Life Science Laboratory (SLSL) at KSC. Due to the nature of the NASA BSP program, we did not receive tissues from all mice for all assays. Ground AEM control mice were placed into the same hardware used in flight and environmental parameters such as temperature and CO2 levels were matched as closely as possible based on 48-hour delayed telemetry data. Conditions were controlled for temperature, humidity, and a 12:12 hr light:dark cycle; food (food bars developed by NASA Ames) and water was provided ad libitum. Vivarium control mice were housed in standard shoebox cages and fed standard rodent chow. Vivarium mice were used to normalize cell counts, minimizing day-to-day variability. Mice were euthanized and dissected within 3-5 hours of landing. As part of the primary science, all mice underwent dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) densitometry (Piximus, Inc., Fitchburg, WI) immediately prior to anesthesia and euthanization. Mice were anesthetized with 3-5% isoflurane and euthanized with 100% CO2 and exsanguination. Livers were collected within 3-4 hours of landing, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in -80C freezer.     RNA was extracted from liver tissue using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT and kept on ice until use. Approximately 20 mg of frozen liver tissue was immediately placed in 800 µL of the Buffer RLT solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at room temperature at 21,300 g to remove cell debris. Following the manufacturer’s protocol, RNA was isolated and purified from the supernatant. RNA was eluted in 50 µL RNase-free H2O. RNA concentration was measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).\n\n     After nucleic acid extraction was completed, samples were aliquoted and stored in -80C freezer. At the time of the spike in, samples designated for sequencing were selected and pulled out of the freezer on dry ice to avoid thaw. ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA cat# 4456739) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added on to the samples at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol. Samples were placed at -80 C freezer until transfer to omics core facility.     RNA sequencing library construction was peroformed by UC Davis Genome Center. Ribosomal RNA was depleted using a Illumina Ribo Zero Gold Human/Mouse/Rat kit. Libraries were prepared using the KAPA Stranded kit with 10 cycles of PCR.     RNA sequencing performed on Illumina HiSeq 4000. Paired end, 150bp at 100 million reads per sample. Performed by UC Davis Genome Center.     The absorbed dose from ionizing radiation received by the flight specimens was estimated using TLD passive dosimeters located in the middeck of the space shuttle, where the payload was located. More specifically, we computed the average between three dosimeters (DLOC1, DLOC2, and DLOC3) for the mission and we divided it by the total duration of the mission to estimate the average absorbed dose rate in mGy/day. This dose rate did not include any shielding effects from the hardware where the specimens resided. The total absorbed dose in water was then computed by simply multiplying the average dose rate with the duration of the experiment. The duration of the experiment was defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”. Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. A table with these detailed computations for all space shuttle datasets is available on GeneLab at https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/environmental/radiation/sts/\n\nThe ground samples were not assessed for radiation exposure.     Data from raw fastq files through RSEM counts were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-A.md). Raw RSEM count data generate with GL-DPPD-7101-A, were re-processed through normalization and DGE analysis as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 96, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher ([https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip]). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0). The data were normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only group B ERCC genes to estimate the size factor. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb, PANTHER.db, and org.Mm.eg.db. Gene annotations were assigned using the GeneLab Reference Annotations pipeline (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).

          "Study Protocol Description": "A cohort of 12-week-old female BALB/c mice were flown to the ISS and housed in the Rodent Habitat and were subjected to microgravity for 39-42 days. Mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. Mice from the same cohort were dissected at time of launch and used as basal controls.    One treatment injection was given prior to launch and the other two treatment injections were given during the mission with around 14 days apart. At the time of injection, Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scan was also performed while the animals were anesthestized by ketamine/xylazine. At the end of the mission, spaceflight and ground controls had blood collected, were euthanized and one hindlimb removed and whole carcasses were stored at -80 C until BSP (Biospecimen Sharing Program) dissection on earth. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). [Spaceflight and ground control mice- untreated, injected with control Ig-G (sham treated). Basal mice received no injections.]     Mouse carcasses were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes for dissection. Each carcass dissection time was no longer than 1 hour from collection of the first tissue. Multiple tissues, including the adrenal glands, were collected from each carcass. Adrenal glands tissues were harvested and snap frozen in LN2, then stored separately in -80 C freezer for sample processing. GeneLab Sample Processing Lab processed the adrenal glands tissues from spaceflight, ground control, and basal control groups for transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenomics.     RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, homogenization buffer for DNA and RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. Left and right side adrenals were pooled and placed in 600 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Samples were then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at room temperature at 21,300 g to remove cell debris. Following the manufacturer s protocol, DNA and RNA were isolated and purified from the supernatant. DNA was eluted in 50 uL EB buffer and RNA was eluted in 40 uL RNase-free H2O. DNA and RNA concentrations were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     After nucleic acid extraction was completed, samples were aliquoted and kept on ice. ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA cat# 4456739) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added on to the samples at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol. Samples were placed at -80 C freezer until transfer to omics core facility.     Sequencing library constructions were performed by UC Davis Genome Center.   RNA Ribo Depletion done with Illumina Ribo Zero Gold Human/Mouse/Rat. Library Preps done with KAPA RNA stranded reagents. 10 cycles PCR done.  DNA Bisulfite conversion done with Zymo lightning kit using 100ng DNA as input. Library Preps performed with Illumina Methylation kit. Unmethylated lambda DNA spiked in to each sample (1ul of 0.04ng/ul). 10uM primers added by PCR. 13 cycles PCR done. Libraries were size selected on Pippin HT 350-600bp.       RNA sequencing performed on Illumina HiSeq 4000. Paired end, 150bp.  DNA sequencing performed on Illumina HiSeq 4000. Single-end read, 150bp.  Performed by UC Davis Genome Center.      The right adrenal gland was placed in 600 uL of pre-chilled urea based protein lysis buffer consisting of 8M urea, with 50mM ammonium bicarbonate, at pH 8.5 in DNase- and RNase- free H2O, protease inhibitors were added to the buffer at 1:100 ratio of 0.1M m-phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride solution in ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) and 1:100 of Halt protease inhibitor cocktail EDTA-free 100X (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). This cell lysis buffer protocol was provided by Stanford University Mass Spectrometry center. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 g for 15 minutes at 4 C to remove cell debris. Supernatant was aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 C. Protein concentration was assessed with Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Waltham, MA).     Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility using the following SUMS protocol:  25 uL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0 was added to each sample, followed by 1.5 uL of 500 mM DTT, incubated at 50 C for 30 minutes and cooled to room temperature. 3 uL of 1 M propionamide was added to each sample and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. 75 uL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 0.02 % protease max was added to each sample followed by 1.5 ug of trypsin/lysC (Promega) and overnight incubation at 37 C.  10 uL of 10 % formic acid, 90 % water was added to each sample to quench the digest. The samples were incubated at 37 C for 10 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 minutes. Microspin C18 columns (NEST group, p/n SEM SS18V) were equilibrated with acetonitrile followed by 2 times wash with 0.1 % formic acid/water and each sample was cleaned and concentrated independently per vendor protocol. The eluant peptides were dried in a speed vac to <2 uL volume and stored at 4C prior to TMT isobaric labeling. Each peptide pool was reconstituted in 100 uL, 100 mM HEPES, pH 8.0. The TMT isobaric labels were reconstituted in 40 uL absolute ethyl alcohol and 20 uL of each isobaric tag as described above was added to the corresponding sample. TMT isobaric label reagent lot number SD239890 (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/90110). The samples incubated at room temperature for 1.5 hr, followed by the addition of 5 uL hydroxylamine to quench the reaction. 50 uL of each isobaric-tagged peptide pool was drawn and pooled to a final volume of 500 uL, 500 uL of 0.1 % formic acid water was added to a final volume of 1mL. This fraction (~250 ug total peptide) was purified on a Water Oasis HLB 3cc C18 cartridge per vendor protocol and the final eluent dried to completion in a speed vac. SCX offline fractionation was performed using a Protea SCX column (p/n SP-155) and the provided buffers. In brief, the previously dried 10plex peptide pool was dissolved in 150 uL reconstitution solution and loaded onto the equilibrated SCX column (3 times) followed by 2 sequential washes. The elution solution provided in the kit was diluted in series to 50 mM, 100 mM, 150 mM, 200 mM, 300 mM and 400 mM (stock) concentrations. The peptides were then eluted starting with the 50 mM salt concentration and collected in a new tube for the entire series. 200 uL of 0.1 % formic acid water was added to each SCX eluted fraction and each was Microspin C18 purified as previously described. Each fraction was reconstituted in 20 uL 0.2 % formic acid, 2 % acetonitrile, 97.8 % water and injected for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis.     Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility using the Thermo Orbitrap Fusion MS.  The samples were divided over 2 protein expression profiling assay runs.     Data Processing: Proteome Discoverer/Byonic Peptide Database: Uniprot mus musculus with isoforms.  Raw files were converted into a .mzML file format using ProteoWizard 3.0.10875.     Data from raw fastq files through RSEM counts were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-A.md). Raw RSEM count data generate with GL-DPPD-7101-A, were re-processed through normalization and DGE analysis as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 96, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher ([https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip]). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0). The data were normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only group B ERCC genes to estimate the size factor. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb, PANTHER.db, and org.Mm.eg.db. Gene annotations were assigned using the GeneLab Reference Annotations pipeline (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0). Processing scripts used can be found on GitHub here: https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/RNAseq/GLDS_Processing_Scripts/GLDS-161/GLDS_version_7     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-June-2019. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8) and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "A cohort of 12-week-old female BALB/c mice were flown to the ISS and housed in the Rodent Habitat and were subjected to microgravity for 39-42 days. Mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. Mice from the same cohort were dissected at time of launch and used as basal controls.    One treatment injection was given prior to launch and the other two treatment injections were given during the mission with around 14 days apart. At the time of injection, Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scan was also performed while the animals were anesthestized by ketamine/xylazine.   At the end of the mission, spaceflight and ground controls had blood collected, were euthanized and one hindlimb removed and whole carcasses were stored at -80 C until BSP (Biospecimen Sharing Program) dissection on earth. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). [Spaceflight and ground control mice- untreated, injected with control Ig-G (sham treated). Basal mice received no injections.] The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     Mouse carcasses were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes for dissection. Each carcass dissection time was no longer than 1 hour from collection of the first tissue. Multiple tissues, including the eye tissue, were collected from each carcass. Eye tissues were harvested and snap frozen in LN2, then stored separately in -80 C freezer for sample processing. GeneLab Sample Processing Lab processed the eye tissues from spaceflight, ground control, and basal control groups for transcriptomics and proteomics.     RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 volumes of beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. One whole eye was immediately placed in 600 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at room temperature at 21,300 g to remove cell debris. Following the manufacturer's protocol, RNA was isolated and purified from the supernatant. RNA was eluted in 40 uL RNase-free H2O and concentration measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     After nucleic acid extraction was completed, samples were aliquoted and kept on ice. ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA cat# 4456739) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added on to the samples at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol. Samples were placed at -80 C freezer until transfer to omics core facility.     Sequencing library constructions were performed by UC Davis Genome Center.   RNA Ribo Depletion done with Illumina Ribo Zero Gold Human/Mouse/Rat. Library Preps done with KAPA RNA stranded reagents. 10 cycles PCR done.  DNA Bisulfite conversion done with Zymo lightning kit using 100ng DNA as input. Library Preps performed with Illumina Methylation kit. Unmethylated lambda DNA spiked in to each sample (1ul of 0.04ng/ul). 10uM primers added by PCR. 13 cycles PCR done. Libraries were size selected on Pippin HT 350-600bp.       RNA sequencing performed on Illumina HiSeq 4000. Paired end, 150bp.  DNA sequencing performed on Illumina HiSeq 4000. Single-end read, 150bp.  Performed by UC Davis Genome Center.      One whole eye was placed in 800 uL of pre-chilled urea based protein lysis buffer consisting of 8M urea, with 50mM ammonium bicarbonate, at pH 8.5 in DNase- and RNase- free H2O, protease inhibitors were added to the buffer at 1:100 ratio of 0.1M m-phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride solution in ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) and 1:100 of Halt protease inhibitor cocktail EDTA-free 100X (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). This cell lysis buffer protocol was provided by Stanford University Mass Spectrometry center. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 g for 15 minutes at 4 C to remove cell debris. Supernatant was aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 C.  Protein concentration was assessed with Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Waltham, MA).       Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility using the following SUMS protocol:  25 uL of 50mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0 was added to each sample, followed by 1.5 uL of 500mM DTT, incubated at 50C for 30 minutes and cooled to room temperature. 3 uL of 1M propionamide was added to each sample and incubated at room temperature for 1hr. 75 uL of 50mM ammonium bicarbonate, 0.02% protease max was added to each sample followed by 1.5 ug of trypsin/lysC (Promega) and overnight incubation at 37C.  10 uL of 10% formic acid, 90% water was added to each sample to quench the digest. The samples were incubated at 37C for 10 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 10,000g for 5 minutes. Microspin C18 columns (NEST group, p/n SEM SS18V) were equilibrated with acetonitrile followed by 2 times wash with 0.1% formic acid/water and each sample was cleaned and concentrated independently per vendor protocol. The eluant peptides were dried in a speed vac to less than 2 uL volume and stored at 4C prior to TMT isobaric labeling. Each peptide pool was reconstituted in 100 uL, 100mM HEPES, pH 8.0. The TMT isobaric labels were reconstituted in 40 uL absolute ethyl alcohol and 20 uL of each isobaric tag as described above was added to the corresponding sample. TMT isobaric label reagent lot number SD239890 (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/90110). The samples incubated at room temperature for 1.5hr, followed by the addition of 5 uL hydroxylamine to quench the reaction. 50 uL of each isobaric-tagged peptide pool was drawn and pooled to a final volume of 500 uL, 500 uL of 0.1% formic acid water was added to a final volume of 1mL. This fraction (~250 ug total peptide) was purified on a Water Oasis HLB 3cc C18 cartridge per vendor protocol and the final eluent dried to completion in a speed vac. SCX offline fractionation was performed using a Protea SCX column (p/n SP-155) and the provided buffers. In brief, the previously dried 10plex peptide pool was dissolved in 150 uL reconstitution solution and loaded onto the equilibrated SCX column (3 times) followed by 2 sequential washes. The elution solution provided in the kit was diluted in series to 50mM, 100mM, 150mM, 200mM, 300mM and 400mM (stock) concentrations. The peptides were then eluted starting with the 50mM salt concentration and collected in a new tube for the entire series. 200 uL of 0.1% formic acid water was added to each SCX eluted fraction and each was Microspin C18 purified as previously described. Each fraction was reconstituted in 20 uL 0.2% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile, 97.8% water and injected for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis.  Samples were divided in two TMT 10-plex labeling groups. Both runs also included one pooled channel with all the basal control, ground control and spaceflight samples.     Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility using the Thermo Orbitrap Fusion MS.  The samples were divided over 2 protein expression profiling assay runs.     Data Processing: Proteome Discoverer/Byonic Peptide Database: Uniprot mus musculus with isoforms.  Raw files were converted into a .mzML file format using ProteoWizard 3.0.10875.     Data from raw fastq files through RSEM counts were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-A.md). Raw RSEM count data generate with GL-DPPD-7101-A, were re-processed through normalization and DGE analysis as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 96, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher ([https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip]). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0). The data were normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only group B ERCC genes to estimate the size factor. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb, PANTHER.db, and org.Mm.eg.db. Gene annotations were assigned using the GeneLab Reference Annotations pipeline (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0). Processing scripts used can be found on GitHub here: https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/RNAseq/GLDS_Processing_Scripts/GLDS-162/GLDS_version_7     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-June-2019. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8) and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports.",

The samples incubated at room temperature for 1.5hr, followed by the addition of 5 uL hydroxylamine to quench the reaction. 50 uL of each isobaric-tagged peptide pool was drawn and pooled to a final volume of 500 uL, 500 uL of 0.1% formic acid water was added to a final volume of 1mL. This fraction (~250 ug total peptide) was purified on a Water Oasis HLB 3cc C18 cartridge per vendor protocol and the final eluent dried to completion in a speed vac. SCX offline fractionation was performed using a Protea SCX column (p/n SP-155) and the provided buffers. In brief, the previously dried 10plex peptide pool was dissolved in 150 uL reconstitution solution and loaded onto the equilibrated SCX column (3 times) followed by 2 sequential washes. The elution solution provided in the kit was diluted in series to 50mM, 100mM, 150mM, 200mM, 300mM and 400mM (stock) concentrations. The peptides were then eluted starting with the 50mM salt concentration and collected in a new tube for the entire series. 200 uL of 0.1% formic acid water was added to each SCX eluted fraction and each was Microspin C18 purified as previously described. Each fraction was reconstituted in 20 uL 0.2% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile, 97.8% water and injected for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis.  Samples were divided in two TMT 10-plex labeling groups. Both runs also included one pooled channel with all the basal control, ground control and spaceflight samples.     Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility using the Thermo Orbitrap Fusion MS.  The samples were divided over 2 protein expression profiling assay runs.     Data Processing: Proteome Discoverer/Byonic Peptide Database: Uniprot mus musculus with isoforms.  Raw files were converted into a .mzML file format using ProteoWizard 3.0.10875.     RNA and DNA were extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, homogenization buffer for DNA and RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 volumes of  beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 25 mg of frozen kidney tissue was immediately placed in 600 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at room temperature at 21,300 g to remove cell debris. Following the manufacturer s protocol, DNA and RNA were isolated and purified from the supernatant. DNA was eluted in 50 uL EB buffer and RNA was eluted in 40 uL RNase-free H2O. DNA and RNA concentrations were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     Sequencing library constructions were performed by UC Davis Genome Center.   RNA Ribo Depletion done with Illumina Ribo Zero Gold Human/Mouse/Rat. Library Preps done with KAPA RNA stranded reagents. 10 cycles PCR done.  DNA Bisulfite conversion done with Zymo lightning kit using 100ng DNA as input. Library Preps performed with Illumina Methylation kit. Unmethylated lambda DNA spiked in to each sample (1ul of 0.04ng/ul). 10uM primers added by PCR. 13 cycles PCR done. Libraries were size selected on Pippin HT 350-600bp.     RNA sequencing performed on Illumina HiSeq 4000. Paired end, 150bp.  DNA sequencing performed on Illumina HiSeq 4000. Single-end read, 150bp.  Performed by UC Davis Genome Center.     After nucleic acid extraction was completed, samples were aliquoted and stored in -80C freezer. At the time of the spike in, samples designated for sequencing were selected and pulled out of the freezer on dry ice to avoid thaw. ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA cat# 4456739) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added on to the samples at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol. Samples were placed at -80 C freezer until transfer to omics core facility.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.0 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.0/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.5) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. The data were normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis_GLbulkRNAseq.html report.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Tissues from flight animals were collected on board the ISS 21- 22 days post-launch in flight animals while tissues from ground control animals were processed similarly on a four-day delay. Upon collection, spleens were stored at 4 C in RNAlater (LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA) for at least 24 h and then stored at -80 C, and livers were frozen in a Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transferred into the MELFI freezer.     RNA extraction was performed according to manufacturer's instructions with the RNeasy mini column (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and stored at -80 °C.     Briefly, sequencing was performed using the standard MiSeq protocol which includes oligo-dT-bead selection and reverse transcription of mRNA to cDNA. Ig-specific primer amplification was not utilized. Additionally, fragmentation was limited to one minute to reduce fragmentation and maintain longer reads.     Illumina MiSeq with paired reads of 300 base pairs was performed on size selected (275 - 800 nt) total RNA isolated from the liver and spleen of three ground control and three flight animals based on highest RIN values (Spleen RIN:5.9 - 8.9, Liver RIN: 6.2 - 7.8) (Ground animals: G1, G2, G3; Flight animals: F1, F2, F3).     The raw fastq file for each sample was assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate raw MultiQC reports.

          "Study Description": "Spaceflight has been shown to suppress the adaptive immune response, altering the distribution and function of lymphocyte populations. B lymphocytes express highly specific and highly diversified receptors, known as immunoglobulins (Ig), that directly bind and neutralize pathogens. Ig diversity is achieved through the enzymatic splicing of gene segments within the genomic DNA of each B cell in a host. The collection of Ig specificities within a host, or Ig repertoire, has been increasingly characterized in both basic research and clinical settings using high-throughput sequencing technology (HTS). We utilized HTS to test the hypothesis that spaceflight affects the B-cell repertoire. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the impact of spaceflight on the unimmunized Ig repertoire of C57BL/6 mice that were flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) during the Rodent Research One validation flight in comparison to ground controls. Individual gene segment usage was similar between ground control and flight animals, however, gene segment combinations and the junctions in which gene segments combine was varied among animals within and between treatment groups. We also found that spontaneous somatic mutations in the IgH and Igκ gene loci were not increased. These data suggest that space flight did not affect the B cell repertoire of mice flown and housed on the ISS over a short period of time.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "A cohort of 12-week-old female BALB/c mice were flown to the ISS and housed in the Rodent Habitat and were subjected to microgravity for 39-42 days. Mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. Mice from the same cohort were dissected at time of launch and used as basal controls.    One treatment injection was given prior to launch and the other two treatment injections were given during the mission with around 14 days apart. At the time of injection, Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scan was also performed while the animals were anesthestized by ketamine/xylazine.   At the end of the mission, spaceflight and ground controls had blood collected, were euthanized and one hindlimb removed and whole carcasses were stored at -80 C until BSP (Biospecimen Sharing Program) dissection on earth. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). [Spaceflight and ground control mice- untreated, injected with control Ig-G (sham treated). Basal mice received no injections.]     Mouse carcasses were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes for dissection. Each carcass dissection time was no longer than 1 hour from collection of the first tissue. Multiple tissues, including the liver tissue, were collected from each carcass. Liver tissues were harvested and snap frozen in LN2, then stored separately in -80 C freezer for sample processing. GeneLab Sample Processing Lab processed the liver tissues from spaceflight, ground control, and basal control groups for transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenomics.     RNA and DNA were extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, homogenization buffer for DNA and RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 volumes of beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 25 mg of frozen liver tissue was immediately placed in 600 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at room temperature at 21,300 g to remove cell debris. Following the manufacturer's protocol, DNA and RNA were isolated and purified from the supernatant. DNA was eluted in 50 uL EB buffer and RNA was eluted in 40 uL RNase-free H2O. DNA and RNA concentrations were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     Sequencing library constructions were performed by UC Davis Genome Center.   RNA Ribo Depletion done with Illumina Ribo Zero Gold Human/Mouse/Rat. Library Preps done with KAPA RNA stranded reagents. 10 cycles PCR done.  DNA Bisulfite conversion done with Zymo lightning kit using 100 ng DNA as input. Library Preps performed with Illumina Methylation kit. Unmethylated lambda DNA spiked in to each sample (1 ul of 0.04 ng/ul). 10 uM primers added by PCR. 13 cycles PCR done.

Single-end, read 150bp.  Performed by UC Davis Genome Center.     Approximately 25 mg of frozen liver tissue was immediately placed in 1000 uL of pre-chilled urea based protein lysis buffer consisting of 8M urea, with 50mM ammonium bicarbonate, at pH 8.5 in DNase- and RNase- free H2O, protease inhibitors were added to the buffer at 1:100 ratio of 0.1M m-phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride solution in ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri)  and 1:100 of Halt protease inhibitor cocktail EDTA-free 100X (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). This cell lysis buffer protocol was provided by Stanford University Mass Spectrometry center. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 g for 15 minutes at 4 C to remove cell debris. Supernatant was aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 C.  Protein concentration was assessed with Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Waltham, MA)        Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility using the following SUMS protocol:  25 uL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0 was added to each sample, followed by 1.5 uL of 500 mM DTT, incubated at 50 C for 30 minutes and cooled to room temperature. 3 uL of 1 M propionamide was added to each sample and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. 75 uL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 0.02 % protease max was added to each sample followed by 1.5 ug of trypsin/lysC (Promega) and overnight incubation at 37 C.  10 uL of 10 % formic acid, 90 % water was added to each sample to quench the digest. The samples were incubated at 37 C for 10 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 minutes. Microspin C18 columns (NEST group, p/n SEM SS18V) were equilibrated with acetonitrile followed by 2 times wash with 0.1 % formic acid/water and each sample was cleaned and concentrated independently per vendor protocol. The eluant peptides were dried in a speed vac to less than2 uL volume and stored at 4C prior to TMT isobaric labeling. Each peptide pool was reconstituted in 100 uL, 100 mM HEPES, pH 8.0. The TMT isobaric labels were reconstituted in 40 uL absolute ethyl alcohol and 20 uL of each isobaric tag as described above was added to the corresponding sample. TMT isobaric label reagent lot number RD231319 (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/90110). The samples incubated at room temperature for 1.5 hr, followed by the addition of 5 uL hydroxylamine to quench the reaction. 50 uL of each isobaric-tagged peptide pool was drawn and pooled to a final volume of 500 uL, 500 uL of 0.1 % formic acid water was added to a final volume of 1mL. This fraction (~250 ug total peptide) was purified on a Water Oasis HLB 3cc C18 cartridge per vendor protocol and the final eluent dried to completion in a speed vac. SCX offline fractionation was performed using a Protea SCX column (p/n SP-155) and the provided buffers. In brief, the previously dried 10plex peptide pool was dissolved in 150 uL reconstitution solution and loaded onto the equilibrated SCX column (3 times) followed by 2 sequential washes. The elution solution provided in the kit was diluted in series to 50 mM, 100 mM, 150 mM, 200 mM, 300 mM and 400 mM (stock) concentrations. The peptides were then eluted starting with the 50 mM salt concentration and collected in a new tube for the entire series. 200 uL of 0.1 % formic acid water was added to each SCX eluted fraction and each was Microspin C18 purified as previously described. Each fraction was reconstituted in 20 uL 0.2 % formic acid, 2 % acetonitrile, 97.8 % water and injected for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis.  Samples were divided in two TMT 10-plex labeling groups. Both runs also include one pooled channel of all the samples except for B7 due to insufficient amount.     Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility using the Thermo Orbitrap Fusion MS.  The samples were divided over 2 protein expression profiling assay runs.     Data Processing: Proteome Discoverer/Byonic Peptide Database: Uniprot mus musculus with isoforms.  Raw files were converted into a .mzML file format using ProteoWizard 3.0.10875.     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 96, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the GeneLab Reference Annotations pipeline (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0). Processing scripts used can be found on GitHub here: https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/RNAseq/GLDS_Processing_Scripts/GLDS-137/GLDS_version_6     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.     Histology on samples was performed by Triangulum Biopharma LLC (San Diego, CA) on archived tissues available from NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA). In brief, for each sample, one half was embedded in paraffin, while the second half was embedded in Optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT) for cryosectioning. Paraffin embedded samples were sectioned at 4 um and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H and E). OCT-embedded samples were cryosectioned at 5 um and lipids stained with Oil Red O (ORO). Whole slide imaging was performed in bright field using a Pannoramic Scan from 3D Histech (a Perkin Elmer Company).     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a Molecular Cellular Imaging data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures/qualities). This enables all histology results to be identically structured for efficient data mining. In the transformation of the data sheet, Triangulum Task and Triangulum ID columns were removed as these are particular to the company who performed the histology. The remaining columns were left to allow efficient sorting by sample groups, dissection context, NASA ID, H and E File ID, and Oil Red O positivity staining percent.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Twenty milligrams of each mouse liver were washed with PBS, homogenized in 200 μL lysis buffer (4% SDS in 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5) and centrifuged at 3000× g at 4 °C for 5 min. Total protein content was measured according to the BCA method. A total protein amount of 100 μg for each sample was used for tryptic digestion according to the common FASP protocol. Briefly, detergents in the samples were exchanged with 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) using Microcon filters (10 kDa cut off, Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Protein disulfide bridges were reduced with 100 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), alkylation of thiols was performed with 55 mM iodacetamide in 8 M urea/100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). Tryptic digestion with a trypsin (Sequencing Grade Modified, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) to protein ratio of 1:100 was carried out overnight at 37 °C in a 50 mM tetraethylammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.5) followed by an additional digestion step under the same conditions with 2 h duration.     We separated 2 μg peptides for each sample with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Ultimate 3000 Nano LC System, Thermo Scientific, Rockwell, IL, USA) in a 15-cm long C18 column with an inner diameter of 75 μm (Acclaim® PepMap™ RSLC, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockwell, IL, USA). The peptides were eluted with a gradient from 5–35% buffer B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) over 115 min at a flow rate of 0.3 μL−1 min. Total run time including 90 min to reach 99% buffer B, flushing 10 min with 99% buffer B and 15 min re-equilibration to buffer A (0.1% formic acid) amounted 155 min. Further analysis was performed with a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Q ExactiveTM HF Hybrid Quadrupole-OrbitrapTM Mass spectrometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockwell, IL, USA). Mass spectra were acquired at a resolution of 60,000 (MS) and 15,000 (MS/MS) in a m/z range of 400−1500 (MS) and 200–2000 (MS/MS). An isolation threshold of 100,000 counts was determined for precursor’s selection and up to top 25 precursors were chosen for fragmentation with high-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) at 25 NCE and 100 ms accumulation time. Precursors with a charged state of +1 were rejected and all measured precursors were excluded from measurement for 20 s. At least three technical runs were measured for each sample.\n\nSeveral technical replicates of our biological replicates were measured and the mass spectrometer did not perform well on all of the technical replicates (e.g. voltage issues/lack of ionization spray during measurement). Therefore, we excluded some technical replicates leading to an unequal number of technical replicates.     The obtained raw data were processed using the MaxQuant software (version 1.5.5.1, Jürgen Cox, Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany) with the built-in search engine Andromeda. Protein sequences of the complete mouse proteome provided by Uniprot (August 2016) was used for protein identification with Andromeda. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was set as fixed modification and protein N-terminal acetylation as well as oxidation of methionines was set as variable modification for the peptide search. A maximum mass deviation of 4.5 ppm was allowed for precursor’s identification and 20 ppm were set as match tolerance for fragment identification (acquisition in Orbitrap). Up to two missed cleavages were allowed for trypsin digestion. The software option “Match between runs” was enabled and features within a time window of 0.7 min were used to match between runs. The false discovery rates (FDR) for peptide and protein identifications were set to 1%. Only unique peptides were used for label-free quantification (LFQ) according to the method described by Cox et al.\n\nRaw files were converted into a .mzML file format using ProteoWizard 3.0.10875.     Male C57/BL6 mice (four–five months old) were selected for spaceflight and ground control experiments. At the time of spaceflight and at the start of the related ground control experiments, the mice had average weight 22 ± 2 g. All mice were pathogen-free. To avoid violent behavior mice were trained before the flight and ground control experiment to form the stable groups of three mice each. Animals were adapted to paste diet. Stable cohorts of three mice were housed in each habitat during spaceflight and ground control experiment. During spaceflight the mice were fed with paste-like food with 76–78% water content developed at IBMP RAS. The mice were kept in a natural light-dark cycle (12 h light and 12 h dark). In our experiment, we compared liver proteomes of the mice which passed 30 days (from 19 April 2013 to 19 May 2013) in a biosatellite in space and sampled 13–25 h after landing (flight group) with mice of the same spaceflight sampled seven days after landing (post-flight group). Mice held in a biosatellite on Earth in the similar cage from 26 July 2013 to 26 August 2013 under the corresponding housing and climate conditions (temperature, humidity, and atmosphere gas composition) served as control group. The environmental conditions as well as food delivery were continuously recorded during spaceflight.     All mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation; livers were immediately sampled and stored at −80 °C until further procedures.     On-board dosimetry details including schematics are available at: https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/environmental/radiation/BION-M1/\n  Summary dosimetry is given per sample. Ground Control samples were assumed to have had background radiation exposure, but exposure was not actually measured.",

          "Study Description": "Harsh environmental conditions including microgravity and radiation during prolonged spaceflights are known to alter hepatic metabolism. Our studies have focused on the analysis of possible changes in metabolic pathways in livers of mice which experienced 30 days of spaceflight with and without an additional re-adaption period of 7 days compared to control mice on Earth. Utilizing shotgun mass spectrometry and label-free quantification, we performed proteomic profiling to investigate mice livers from the spaceflight project “Bion-M 1”. No significant alterations in protein levels were observed between control mice liver and spaceflight mice which is possibly caused by insufficient fold change detection combined with high variances within the groups. In contrast, our results show that more than a third of the quantified protein levels are altered comparing the liver proteome of mice with and without re-adaption time after their spaceflight. Proteins related to amino acid metabolism showed higher levels after re-adaption, which may indicate higher rates of gluconeogenesis. Members of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor pathway reconstitute their level after 7 days due to a decrease in fold change, which indicates decreased signs of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Moreover, bile acid secretion regenerates on Earth due to reconstitution of related transmembrane proteins and elevated levels of the drug-metabolising enzymes belonging to the CYP superfamily decrease 7 days after the spaceflight. Thus, our study demonstrates reconstitution of pharmacological response and early signs of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease recover within 7 days, whereas glucose uptake should be monitored due to alterations in gluconeogenesis.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "On-board dosimetry details including schematics are available at: https://www.nasa.gov/reference/osdr-environmental-data/ hds-sidebar-nav-3. Summary dosimetry is given per sample. Ground Control samples were assumed to have had background radiation exposure, but exposure not actually measured.     Male 19 to 20 week old C57/BL6 mice were maintained during the 30 day high-orbit (~550 km) flight in special modules (confined housing and specific diet conditions), with three animals per module. Approximately 13–16 h after landing, flown animals were weighed and randomly split into two groups. Hence, five mice were immediately sacrificed by cervical dislocation to constitute the Flight group (F), and four other mice were sacrificed after an 8 day recovery period (Recovery group, R). Three control groups were formed, with animals maintained on Earth for 30 days either under space-confined housing and diet conditions (Ground Control group, GC, n equals 5) or in standard housing conditions (Vivarium Control group, VC, n equals 5) and with animals housed in standard conditions for 38 days to form the Recovery Control group (RC; n equals 5). Immediately after sacrifice, muscle tissue from three different muscles, namely, vastus lateralis (VL), extensor digitorum longus (EDL), and soleus (SOL), were dissected and stored at −80 C until analysis. We obtained the three muscle tissues from the left hindlimb of mice from all groups, except for the R and RC groups, for which only the EDL muscle was available.     Frozen tissue samples were weighted and grinded using a ball mill (3x 30 seconds @ 25Hz; MM400, Retsch) under liquid nitrogen and proteins were extracted using 7.5 volumes (i.e. 7.5µl/mg of tissue) of extraction buffer (8 M urea, 2 M thiourea , 2 % CHAPS, 2 % DTT, 30 mM Tris pH 8, protease inhibitors). After solubilisation for 30 minutes @ 37°C, samples were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 15000 x g, 4 °C to remove cell/tissue debris. Protein concentration in the supernatants was determined by a Bradford assay using BSA as standard (both from Bio-Rad). For quality assessment of the LC-MS/MS analyses, a sample pool was generated comprising equal amounts of all protein extracts for each muscle. 50 µg of each sample were mixed with 4x SDS sample buffer (1x: 50 mM Tris pH 6.8, 1 mM EDTA, 5 % β-ME, 2.5 % SDS and 10 % glycerol), incubated at 37 °C for 10 minutes and run for 15 minutes at 35 V into a 4 % polyacrylamide stacking gel in order to let proteins enter approximately 4 mm into the gel. Electrophoresis was stopped at this point and gels were stained by Colloidal Coomassie Blue. Both the “stacked” protein-band and the part of the gel above this band were excised with each of them being again divided into 4 pieces before in-gel digestion using an automatic pipetting device (MassPrep, Waters, Milford, MA). Following de-staining, reduction (DTT) and alkylation (iodoacetamide), proteins were digested with trypsin (300 ng/band) overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were consecutively extracted in 40 % and 60 % acetonitrile/0.1 % formic acid in water for one hour each and in 100 % acetonitrile (ACN) for 15 minutes at 450 rpm on an orbital shaker. At this stage peptide extracts were spiked with iRT reference peptides (Biognosys AG, Schlieren, Switzerland) and kept at -80°C until LC-MS analysis. Just before LC-MS/MS analysis, volume of peptide extracts was reduced in a speed-vac and sample volumes were adjusted to 25 µl with 1% ACN, 0.1 % formic acid.\n\nSamples were analysed on a nanoUPLC-system (nanoAcquity, Waters) coupled to a quadrupole-Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer (Q-Exactive plus, Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA).  Two µl of each sample was concentrated/desalted on a trap column (C18, 180 μm x 20 mm, 5 µm; Waters) using 99 % solvent A (0.1 % formic acid in water)/1 % solvent B (0.1 % formic acid in ACN) at a flow rate of 5 µl/min for 3 minutes. Afterwards, peptides were transferred and eluted from the separation column (BEH130 C18, 250 mm x 75 µm, 1.7 µm; Waters) maintained at 60 °C using a 85 minutes (VL) or 150 minutes (EDL and SOL) gradient from 3-40 % B.     Samples were analysed on a nanoUPLC-system (nanoAcquity, Waters) coupled to a quadrupole-Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer (Q-Exactive plus, Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA). The Q-Exactive Plus was operated in positive ion mode with source temperature set to 250°C and spray voltage to 1.8 kV. Full scan MS spectra (300-1800 m/z) were acquired at a resolution of 140,000 at m/z 200, a maximum injection time of 50 ms and an AGC target value of 3 x 106 charges with the lock-mass option being enabled (445.12002 m/z). Up to 10 most intense precursors per full scan were isolated using a 2 m/z window and fragmented using higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD, normalised collision energy of 27) and dynamic exclusion of already fragmented precursors was set to 60 s. MS/MS spectra were acquired with a resolution of 17,500 at m/z 200, a maximum injection time of 100 ms and an AGC target value of 1 x 105.\nTo ensure good data quality by following instrument performance in “real-time” all along the experiment, we implemented several QC measures based on chromatographic separations as well as peptide/protein identification and quantification metrics. For each muscle, a sample pool comprising equal amounts of all protein extracts was made and injected regularly during the whole experiment. A set of reference peptides (iRT kit; Biognosys AG, Schlieren, Switzerland) was added to each sample before LC–MS/MS analysis. For a given muscle, all samples were injected using a randomized and blocked injection sequence (one biological replicate of each group plus pool in each block). To minimize carry-over, a column wash (50% ACN during 20 min) was included in between each block, in addition to a solvent blank injection, which was performed after each sample. Peak intensities and retention times of reference peptides, as well as protein identification rates, were monitored in a daily fashion.     MS raw data were processed using MaxQuant (version 1.5.3.30). Peak lists were searched using Andromeda search engine implemented in MaxQuant against a protein database created using the MSDA software suite. The database contained mice protein sequences (Swissprot; Taxonomy ID: 10090; 16688 entries), which were downloaded in November 2014. Sequences of common contaminants like keratins and trypsin (247 entries) were finally added to the database (contaminants.fasta included in MaxQuant). A maximum number of one missed cleavage and a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% for both peptide spectrum matches (minimum length of seven amino acids) and proteins was accepted during identification. Regarding quantification, data normalisation and protein abundance estimation was performed using the MaxLFQ (label free quantification) option implemented in MaxQuant using a “minimal ratio count” of one. “Match between runs” was enabled using a one minute time window after retention time alignment. Both unmodified and modified (acetylation of protein N-termini and oxidation of methionine residues) peptides were considered for quantification while shared peptides were excluded. All other MaxQuant parameters were set as default. Only proteins with at least four of five valid values per group as well as the ones “absent” (i.e. 0 valid values) in samples from a given group were kept for further analysis.",

          "Study Description": "Upon weightlessness and microgravity, deleterious effects on the neurosensory and neurovestibular systems, haematological changes, and deconditioning of musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary functions have been reported. In particular, loss of muscle mass and strength are triggered by weightlessness in humans during space flights, that is similarly observed as a result of physical inactivity conditions and aging on Earth. However, skeletal muscle tissue is of paramount importance for health maintenance (e.g. being essential to locomotion, heat production, and metabolism). To better prevent or eventually treat microgravity-induced muscle atrophy, its underlying mechanisms have first to be characterized in detail. Using cutting-edge quantitative proteomics, the aim of the present study was therefore to get an in depth view of the molecular regulations triggered by space conditions in skeletal muscles of mice during the 30-day flight of the BION-M1 biosatellite. As muscles differing in their fiber type composition appear to respond differently to microgravity (see above), we characterized here the differential response of the soleus, extensor digitorum longus and vastus lateralis muscles.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "C57BL/6 male mice (22–25 g) were obtained from the Animal Breeding Facility Branch of Shemyakin & Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russia. Mice were transported to the animal facility of Moscow State University (Institute of Mitoengineering) for training and selection and 19–20 weeks old mice were used in all the experiments. In detail, mice were randomly divided in 3 groups: BION Flown (BF), mice to be flown aboard the BION-M1 biosatellite exposed for 30 days to microgravity, BION Ground (BG) mice housed for 30 days in the same biosatellite habitat on ground, and Flight Control (FC) mice housed in the animal facility during the duration of the spaceflight.     Mouse skeletal muscle tissue sampling of all the experimental groups (longissimus dorsi and tongue) and freezing was performed by our Russian partners on site (IMBP, Moscow, Russia, contract # Bion-M1/2013 between RF SRC-IMBP and the Charité Berlin, Germany). In particular post-flight tissue sampling was done within 12–14 h at the IMBP after landing in Kazakhstan. All frozen samples were delivered deeply frozen in dry ice and further processed in our laboratory.     On-board dosimetry details including schematics are available at: https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/environmental/radiation/BION-M1/\nSummary dosimetry is given per sample. Ground Control samples were assumed to have had background radiation exposure, but exposure not actually measured.     Total RNA was isolated from mouse longissimus dorsi (n = 5 for each group: BF, BG, and FC) and tongue (n = 3 for BF and BG; n = 2 for FC) muscles of each experimental group (BF, BG, and FC) by means of RNeasy micro Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Frozen tissue samples were pulverized in liquid nitrogen and lysates were prepared in lysis buffer. Tissue lysate was centrifuged and the supernatant was used for RNA phenol/chloroform extraction. Single-step method of RNA isolation by acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction was performed. The aqueous layer was mixed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol and total RNA was extracted using RNeasy spin columns according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA integrity was checked by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent technologies, PA, USA).     The amplification and labeling of 100 ng of the RNA samples were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) using the GeneChip 3' IVT Express Protocol.     15 µg of each labeled and fragmented cRNA sample was hybridized for 16 hours at 45°C to an Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse 430A 2.0 Array.     Arrays were scanned at 1.56-µm resolution using the Affymetrix GeneChip System confocal scanner 3000.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.5 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.5/Microarray/Affymetrix/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAffymetrix). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.4). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using oligo (version 1.58.0). Raw data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). The raw probe level intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the oligo (version 1.58.0) quantile method. Normalized probe level data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). Normalized probe level data was summarized to the probeset level using the oligo (version 1.58.0) RMA method. Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probeset using biomaRt (version 2.50.0), Ensembl database (ensembl.org, release 107). Gene annotations were assigned for every probeset that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

At present no study investigated the complexity of the molecular changes in human or mouse paraspinal muscles exposed to microgravity. The aim of this study was to evaluate longissimus dorsi and tongue (as a new potential in-flight negative control) adaptation to microgravity at global gene expression level. C57BL/N6 male mice were flown aboard the BION-M1 biosatellite for 30 days (BF) or housed in a replicate flight habitat on ground (BG). Global gene expression analysis identified 89 transcripts differentially regulated in longissimus dorsi of BF vs. BG mice (False Discovery Rate less than 0.05 and fold change less than -2 and greater than +2), while only a small number of genes were found differentially regulated in tongue muscle ( BF vs. BG equals 27 genes). Overall Design: C57BL/N6 mice were randomly divided in 3 groups: Bion Flown (BF), mice flown aboard the Bion M1 biosatellite in microgravity environment for 30 days; Bion Ground (BG), mice housed in the same habitat of flown animals but exposed to earth gravity; and Flight Control (FC), mice housed in a standard animal facility.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Female C57BL/6CR mice were flown in STS-135 using NASA's animal enclosure modules (AEMs). A set of ground controls (Ground AEMs) was housed at the Space Life Science Laboratory (SLSL) at KSC. Ground AEM control mice were placed into the same hardware using in flight to mimic the environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide levels of the space shuttle middeck. AEM controls were fed a special NASA food bar diet same as space flown mice. All animals were maintained on a 12-h on/off light cycle.\nWithin 3-5 h of landing, the mice were euthanized and three pieces of skin tissue from the back of each mouse were removed (6-7 mice/group). Two pieces from each mouse were placed individually in sterile cryovials, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80C prior to use.\nTissues were kept at -80C and shipped to LLU on dry ice overnight     The absorbed dose from ionizing radiation received by the flight specimens was estimated using TLD passive dosimeters located in the middeck of the space shuttle, where the payload was located. More specifically, we computed the average between three dosimeters (DLOC1, DLOC2, and DLOC3) for the mission and we divided it by the total duration of the mission to estimate the average absorbed dose rate in mGy/day. This dose rate did not include any shielding effects from the hardware where the specimens resided. The total absorbed dose in water was then computed by simply multiplying the average dose rate with the duration of the experiment. The duration of the experiment was defined as the time in space during which the specimen was living. Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. A table with these detailed computations for all space shuttle datasets is available on GeneLab at https://www.nasa.gov/reference/osdr-environmental-data/. The ground samples were not assessed for radiation exposure.     The sample preparation process was carried out using the automated MicroLab STAR system from Hamilton Company.  Recovery standards were added prior to the first step in the extraction process for QC purposes.  Sample preparation was conducted using a proprietary series of organic and aqueous extractions to remove the protein fraction while allowing maximum recovery of small molecules.  The resulting extract was divided into two fractions; one for analysis by LC and one for analysis by GC.  Samples were placed briefly on a TurboVap (Zymark) to remove the organic solvent.  Each sample was then frozen and dried under vacuum.  Samples were then prepared for the appropriate instrument, either LC/MS or GC/MS.\n\nCompleted by Metabolon Inc.     Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS)\n\nExtracts were split into two aliquots, dried, then reconstituted in acidic or basic LC-compatible solvents, each of which contained 11 or more injection standards at fixed concentrations. A Waters ACQUITY UPLC and a Thermo-Finnigan LTQ-FT MS were utilized for the analysis. One aliquot was analyzed using acidic positive ion optimized conditions and the other using basic negative ion optimized conditions in two independent injections using separate dedicated columns. Extracts reconstituted in acidic conditions were gradient eluted from a Waters BEH C(18) 2.1 x 100 mm, 1.7 um column using water and methanol both containing 0.1% formic acid, while basic extracts, which also used water/methanol, contained 6.5 mM ammonium bicarbonate. MS analysis alternated between MS and data-dependent MS2 scans using dynamic exclusion, scanning from 80-1000 m/z. Accurate mass measurements were made on precursor ions with greater than 2 million counts; typical mass error was less than 5 ppm\n\nGas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS)\n\nExtracts destined for GC/MS were re-dried under vacuum desiccation for a minimum of 24 h prior to derivatization under dried nitrogen using bis(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA). The GC column was 5% phenyl/95% dimethyl polysiloxane fused silica (20 m x 0.18 mm ID; 0.18 um film thickness) and the temperature ramp was from 40C to 300C within 16 min; helium was used as the carrier gas. Extracts were analyzed on a Thermo-Finnigan Trace DSQ fast-scanning single-quadrupole MS using electron impact ionization set to scan from 50-750 m/z at unit mass resolving power.     Mass spectral data were loaded into a relational database, where QC limits were imposed. Peaks were identified using Metabolon's peak integration software. Compounds were identified by comparison to library entries of purified standards or recurrent unknown entities based on the combination of chromatographic properties and mass spectra. Data normalization was performed for studies spanning multiple days to correct for variation resulting from instrument inter-day tuning differences. Because all samples where processed and run in the same batch, no additional normalization was performed on the data.  Each compound was corrected by registering the medians to equal 1.00 in run-day blocks and normalizing each data point proportionately. Missing values, assumed to be below the limit of detection of the instrument, were imputed with the observed minimum after normalization\nTo facilitate visualization of the data and statistical analyses, the raw data for each biochemical was re-scaled to a median of 1 and any missing values (assumed to be below the limit of detection of the platform) were imputed with the minimum observed level of that metabolite (Scaled Imputed Data).     RNA extraction from skin tissues were performed at SABiosciences service core (Frederick, MD).     Based on SABiosciences service core (Frederick, MD) protocols.     Based on SABiosciences service core (Frederick, MD) protocols.     RT-PCR array services were performed at SABiosciences service core. PCR reactions were performed to evaluate expression of 84 genes using RT^2 Profiler PCR array PAMM-031A (Mouse Extracellular Matrix and Adhesion Molecules array) and PAMM-065A (Mouse Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant Defense array). Data is pooled into two groups: Group 1 and Control Group.     Data Analysis was performed using SABiosciences' PCR array data analysis software. Relative changes in gene expression were calculated using the comparative threshold cycle (average deltaC) method.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Data collected from placebo mice flown on STS-135 as part of the CBTM-3 payload sponsored by Amgen and BioServe Space Technologies. On July 8, 2011, age- and weight-matched female C57BL/6NCrl mice (n equals 15/group) were placed into three Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs, 2 groups of 5 per AEM separated by a wire mesh) and flown on the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) for 13 days. There were two sets of ground controls housed at the Space Life Science Laboratory (SLSL) at KSC. Due to the nature of the NASA BSP program, we did not receive tissues from all mice for all assays. Ground AEM control mice were placed into the same hardware used in flight and environmental parameters such as temperature and CO2 levels were matched as closely as possible based on 48-hour delayed telemetry data. Conditions were controlled for temperature, humidity, and a 12:12 hr light:dark cycle; food (food bars developed by NASA Ames) and water was provided ad libitum. Vivarium control mice were housed in standard shoebox cages and fed standard rodent chow. Vivarium mice were used to normalize cell counts, minimizing day-to-day variability. Mice were euthanized and dissected within 3-5 hours of landing. As part of the primary science, all mice underwent dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) densitometry (Piximus, Inc., Fitchburg, WI) immediately prior to anesthesia and euthanization. Mice were anesthetized with 3-5% isoflurane and euthanized with 100% CO2 and exsanguination. These studies were approved by the NASA Ames and University of Colorado at Boulder Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs).     The absorbed dose from ionizing radiation received by the flight specimens was estimated using TLD passive dosimeters located in the middeck of the space shuttle, where the payload was located. More specifically, we computed the average between three dosimeters (DLOC1, DLOC2, and DLOC3) for the mission and we divided it by the total duration of the mission to estimate the average absorbed dose rate in mGy/day. This dose rate did not include any shielding effects from the hardware where the specimens resided. The total absorbed dose in water was then computed by simply multiplying the average dose rate with the duration of the experiment. The duration of the experiment was defined as the time in space during which the specimen was 'living'. Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. A table with these detailed computations for all space shuttle datasets is available on GeneLab at https://www.nasa.gov/reference/osdr-environmental-data/. The ground samples were not assessed for radiation exposure.     Tissue Handling: Tissues were harvested, weighed, and processed at the KSC. Liver tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen at the time of dissection and stored at -80C until analysis. Tissues were distributed across a large team of investigators under the guidance/organization of NASA's Biospecimen Sharing Program; we received one half lobe of liver from six mice per group. Frozen liver pieces (n equals 6/group) were sent to Metabolon, Inc. and stored at -80C before use.     The sample preparation process was carried out using the automated MicroLab STAR system from Hamilton Company.  Recovery standards were added prior to the first step in the extraction process for QC purposes.  Sample preparation was conducted using a proprietary series of organic and aqueous extractions to remove the protein fraction while allowing maximum recovery of small molecules.  The resulting extract was divided into two fractions; one for analysis by LC and one for analysis by GC.  Samples were placed briefly on a TurboVap (Zymark) to remove the organic solvent.  Each sample was then frozen and dried under vacuum.  Samples were then prepared for the appropriate instrument, either LC/MS or GC/MS.     Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS)\n\nExtracts were split into two aliquots, dried, then reconstituted in acidic or basic LC-compatible solvents, each of which contained 11 or more injection standards at fixed concentrations. A Waters ACQUITY UPLC and a Thermo-Finnigan LTQ-FT MS were utilized for the analysis. One aliquot was analyzed using acidic positive ion optimized conditions and the other using basic negative ion optimized conditions in two independent injections using separate dedicated columns. Extracts reconstituted in acidic conditions were gradient eluted from a Waters BEH C(18) 2.1 x 100 mm, 1.7 um column using water and methanol both containing 0.1% formic acid, while basic extracts, which also used water/methanol, contained 6.5 mM ammonium bicarbonate. MS analysis alternated between MS and data-dependent MS2 scans using dynamic exclusion, scanning from 80-1000 m/z. Accurate mass measurements were made on precursor ions with greater than 2 million counts; typical mass error was less than 5 ppm\n\n\n\nGas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS)\n\nExtracts destined for GC/MS were re-dried under vacuum desiccation for a minimum of 24 h prior to derivatization under dried nitrogen using bis(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA). The GC column was 5% phenyl/95% dimethyl polysiloxane fused silica (20 m x 0.18 mm ID; 0.18 um film thickness) and the temperature ramp was from 40C to 300C within 16 min; helium was used as the carrier gas. Extracts were analyzed on a Thermo-Finnigan Trace DSQ fast-scanning single-quadrupole MS using electron impact ionization set to scan from 50-750 m/z at unit mass resolving power.     Mass spectral data were loaded into a relational database, where QC limits were imposed. Peaks were identified using Metabolon's peak integration software. Compounds were identified by comparison to library entries of purified standards or recurrent unknown entities based on the combination of chromatographic properties and mass spectra. Data normalization was performed for studies spanning multiple days to correct for variation resulting from instrument inter-day tuning differences. Because all samples where processed and run in the same batch, no additional normalization was performed on the data.  Each compound was corrected by registering the medians to equal 1.00 in run-day blocks and normalizing each data point proportionately. Missing values, assumed to be below the limit of detection of the instrument, were imputed with the observed minimum after normalization\nTo facilitate visualization of the data and statistical analyses, the raw data for each biochemical was re-scaled to a median of 1 and any missing values (assumed to be below the limit of detection of the platform) were imputed with the minimum observed level of that metabolite (Scaled Imputed Data).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "A cohort of 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Lab) were flown to the ISS, housed in the Rodent Habitat and were subjected to microgravity for 37 days. Mice of simiar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     The mice were euthanized by ISS crew with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation, frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C) and brought back to Earth. The mouse carcasses were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes.  Multiple tissues, including left and right soleus muscle, were collected from each carcass. Total dissection time for each carcass was no longer than 30 minutes since collection of the first tissue. Left and right soleus muscles were harvested and stored separately overnight at 4 C in RNAlater, then transferred into -80 C.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://www.nasa.gov/reference/osdr-environmental-data/     RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 volumes of beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and kept on ice until use. After thawing on ice, left and right soleus muscles were weighed together and immediately placed in 800 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at room temperature at 15,000 RPM to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was eluted twice per sample in 30 uL H2O per elution. Concentration and absorbance ratios for all RNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     RNA sequencing library construction was performed by UC Davis Genome Center using the Illumina TruSeq stranded RNA library prep kit after ribo-depletion. The libraries were QC-ed by bioanalyzer and quantified by fluorometric Qubit measurements.     The RNA library sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform, three high output HiSeq lanes with 100 bp paired end stranded reads and index reads. 30 million reads per sample was requested. Performed by UC Davis Genome Center.     Raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.2 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.2/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1).     DNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, homogenization buffer for DNA purification was made by adding 1:100 volumes of beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and kept on ice until use. After thawing on ice, left and right soleus muscles were weighed together and immediately placed in 800 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at room temperature at 15,000 RPM to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA following the manufacturer's protocol. DNA was eluted twice per sample in 50 uL H2O per elution. Concentration and absorbance ratios for all DNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).     DNA sequencing library construction was performed by UC Davis Genome Center. Aliquots of each DNA sample was bisulfite-converted with the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold kit (Zymo Research). Sequencing libraries was generated from the converted DNA sample with the EpiGnome Methyl-Seq kit (Epicentre). The resulting libraries were QC-ed by bioanalyzer and quantified by fluorometric Qubic measurements and RT-PCR.     The BS-sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 at UC Davis Genome Center. Each library was sequenced on one HiSeq lane by itself with paired end 150bp reads.",

          "Study Description": "NASA's Rodent Research (RR) project is playing a critical role in advancing biomedical research on the physiological effects of space environments. Due to the limited resources for conducting biological experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS), it is imperative to use crew time efficiently while maximizing high-quality science return. NASA's GeneLab project has as its primary objectives to 1) further increase the value of these experiments using a multi-omics, systems biology-based approach, and 2) disseminate these data without restrictions to the scientific community. The current investigation assessed viability of RNA, DNA, and protein extracted from archived RR-1 tissue samples for epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic assays. During the first RR spaceflight experiment, a variety of tissue types were harvested from subjects, snap-frozen or RNAlater-preserved, and then stored at least a year at -80C after return to Earth. They were then prioritized for this investigation based on likelihood of significant scientific value for spaceflight research. All tissues were made available to GeneLab through the bio-specimen sharing program managed by the Ames Life Science Data Archive and included mouse adrenal glands, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, soleus, eye, and kidney. We report here protocols for and results of these tissue extractions, and thus, the feasibility and value of these kinds of omics analyses. In addition to providing additional opportunities for investigation of spaceflight effects on the mouse transcriptome and proteome in new kinds of tissues, our results may also be of value to program managers for the prioritization of ISS crew time for rodent research activities.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "A cohort of 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were flown to the ISS, housed in the Rodent Habitat and were subjected to microgravity for 37 days. Mice of simiar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. The mice were euthanized by ISS crew with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation, frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C) and brought back to Earth. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     The mouse carcasses were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes.  Multiple tissues, including left gastrocnemius muscle, were collected from each carcass. Total dissection time for each carcass was no longer than 30 minutes since collection of the first tissue. Left gastrocnemius muscle was harvested, cut in half with a scalpel, and snap frozen separately with liquid nitrogen.     TRIzol: After thawing on ice and using a scalpel, approximately 1/3 of total gastrocnemius tissue was weighed and immediately placed in 1 ml of the TRIzol solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 X g for 10 minutes at 4 C to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate RNA following the manufacturer protocol. The isolated RNA was then purified on column with DNAse I (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valenica, CA). The purified RNA was eluted in 30 uL H2O. Concentration and absorbance ratios for RNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).  PrepEase: After thawing on ice and using a scalpel, approximately 1/3 of tissue was weighed and immediately placed in 300 ul of the homogenization buffer included in the PrepEase Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (USB, Cleveland, OH) and DNA isolation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The DNA pellets were resuspended in 50 ul of DNA Resuspension Buffer. Concentration and absorbance ratios for DNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).     RNA methylation analysis was performed by Epigentek Group Inc. 60 samples of Total mouse gastrocnemius RNA was prepared by GeneLab and received by Epigentek. The samples were subjected to bisulfite conversion, cDNA reverse transcription, library preparation, Bioanalyzer QC, KAPA library quantification, multiplex NGS on an Illumina HiSeq2500 and advanced data analysis.  Bisulfite Conversion: RNA samples were bisulfite treated with the Methylamp RNA Bisulfite Conversion Kit Kit (Epigentek Cat.   P-9003). 200 ng for the samples N1, N2, N4 through N12, and N37 through N60. 100 ng for the samples N3 and N13 through N36.  Library Preparation: -cDNA was synthesized from bisulfite treated RNA and ligated with adaptors by using random probing method. -Library amplification was performed using indexed primers and library cDNA was purified with magnetic beads -Purified library cDNA was eluted in 12 uL of water.  Library QC: Library construction was verified on a Bioanalyzer and KAPA Library Quantification.     5 nM of sample libraries were subjected to next generation sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 in Single Read 50 nts format.     Data analysis was performed by Epigentek, and the detailed analysis workflow is provided in the Supplemental Materials.     For protein homogenization the urea based protein lysis buffer consisted of 8M urea, with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, at pH 8.5 in DNase- and RNase-free H2O and was custom ordered (Teknova, Hollister, CA). This recipe was initially provided by Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS). Protease inhibitors, 1:100 of 0.1 M phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride solution in ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) and 1:100 of complete EDTA-free tablets (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), were added to the lysis buffer kept on ice. After thawing on ice and using a scalpel, approximately 1/3 of total gastrocnemius tissue was weighed and immediately added to 650 uL protein lysis buffer. Each sample was homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4 C and at 14,000 X g to remove cell debris. A 30 uL sample of each supernatant was kept on ice for total protein concentration assay, and the rest of the supernatant was snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen in aliquots. The Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to measure the total protein concentration of each protein sample.     Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility using the following SUMS protocol:  25 uL of 50mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0 was added to each sample, followed by 1.5 uL of 500mM DTT, incubated at 50C for 30 minutes and cooled to room temperature. 3 uL of 1M propionamide was added to each sample and incubated at room temperature for 1hr. 75 uL of 50mM ammonium bicarbonate, 0.02% protease max was added to each sample followed by 1.5 ug of trypsin/lysC (Promega) and overnight incubation at 37C.  10 uL of 10% formic acid, 90% water was added to each sample to quench the digest. The samples were incubated at 37C for 10 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 10,000g for 5 minutes. Microspin C18 columns (NEST group, p/n SEM SS18V) were equilibrated with acetonitrile followed by 2 times wash with 0.1% formic acid/water and each sample was cleaned and concentrated independently per vendor protocol. The eluant peptides were dried in a speed vac to less than 2 uL volume and stored at 4C prior to TMT isobaric labeling. Each peptide pool was reconstituted in 100 uL, 100mM HEPES, pH 8.0. The TMT isobaric labels were reconstituted in 40 uL absolute ethyl alcohol and 20 uL of each isobaric tag as described above was added to the corresponding sample. The samples incubated at room temperature for 1.5hr, followed by the addition of 5 uL hydroxylamine to quench the reaction. 50 uL of each isobaric-tagged peptide pool was drawn and pooled to a final volume of 500 uL, 500 uL of 0.1% formic acid water was added to a final volume of 1mL. This fraction (around 250 ug total peptide) was purified on a Water Oasis HLB 3cc C18 cartridge per vendor protocol and the final eluent dried to completion in a speed vac. SCX offline fractionation was performed using a Protea SCX column (p/n SP-155) and the provided buffers. In brief, the previously dried 10plex peptide pool was dissolved in 150 uL reconstitution solution and loaded onto the equilibrated SCX column (3 times) followed by 2 sequential washes. The elution solution provided in the kit was diluted in series to 50mM, 100mM, 150mM, 200mM, 300mM and 400mM (stock) concentrations. The peptides were then eluted starting with the 50mM salt concentration and collected in a new tube for the entire series. 200 uL of 0.1% formic acid water was added to each SCX eluted fraction and each was Microspin C18 purified as previously described. Each fraction was reconstituted in 20 uL 0.2% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile, 97.8% water and injected for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis.  Samples were divided in two TMT 10-plex labeling groups. Run 1 includes M23, M24, M25, M33, M34 and M35, and Run 2 includes M26, M27, M28, M36, M37, M38. Both runs also include four pooled samples: pool of all flight samples, pool of all ground control samples, pool of all flight and ground control samples and one empty channel.     Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility using the Thermo Orbitrap Fusion MS.

The DNA pellets were resuspended in 50 ul of DNA Resuspension Buffer. Concentration and absorbance ratios for DNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).     RNA sequencing library construction was performed by UC Davis Genome Center using the Illumina TruSeq stranded RNA library prep kit after ribo-depletion. The libraries were QC-ed by bioanalyzer and quantified by fluorometric Qubit measurements.     The RNA library sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. The libraries were sequenced across two sequencing runs at 100bp and 150bp paired end reads. Performed by UC Davis Genome Center.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.0 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.0/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.5) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1).

Concentration and absorbance ratios for DNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).     DNA sequencing library construction was performed by UC Davis Genome Center. Aliquots of each DNA sample was bisulfite-converted with the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold kit (Zymo Research). Sequencing libraries was generated from the converted DNA sample with the EpiGnome Methyl-Seq kit (Epicentre). The resulting libraries were QC-ed by bioanalyzer and quantified by fluorometric Qubic measurements and RT-PCR.     The BS-sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 at UC Davis Genome Center. Each library was sequenced on one HiSeq lane by itself with paired end 150bp reads.",

          "Study Description": "NASA's Rodent Research (RR) project is playing a critical role in advancing biomedical research on the physiological effects of space environments. Due to the limited resources for conducting biological experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS), it is imperative to use crew time efficiently while maximizing high-quality science return. NASA's GeneLab project has as its primary objectives to 1) further increase the value of these experiments using a multi-omics, systems biology-based approach, and 2) disseminate these data without restrictions to the scientific community. The current investigation assessed viability of RNA, DNA, and protein extracted from archived RR-1 tissue samples for epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic assays. During the first RR spaceflight experiment (RR-1), a variety of tissue types were harvested from subjects, snap-frozen or RNAlater-preserved, and then stored at least a year at -80C after return to Earth. They were then prioritized for this investigation based on likelihood of significant scientific value for spaceflight research. All tissues were made available to GeneLab through the bio-specimen sharing program managed by the Ames Life Science Data Archive and included mouse adrenal glands, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, soleus, eye, and kidney. We report here protocols for and results of these tissue extractions, and thus, the feasibility and value of these kinds of omics analyses. In addition to providing additional opportunities for investigation of spaceflight effects on the mouse transcriptome and proteome in new kinds of tissues, our results may also be of value to program managers for the prioritization of ISS crew time for rodent research activities.",

Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.2 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.2/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1).     A cohort of 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Lab) were flown to the ISS, housed in the Rodent Habitat and were subjected to microgravity for 37 days. Mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions.     The mice were euthanized by ISS crew with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation, frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C) and brought back to Earth. The mouse carcasses were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes.  Multiple tissues, including left and right tibialis anterior (TA) muscles, were collected from each. Total dissection time for each carcass was no longer than 30 minutes since collection of the first tissue. Left and right tibialis anterior (TA) muscles were harvested and stored separately overnight at 4 C in RNAlater, then transferred intact to a -80 C freezer.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://www.nasa.gov/reference/osdr-environmental-data/.     For protein homogenization the urea based protein lysis buffer consisted of 8M urea, with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, at pH 8.5 in DNase- and RNase-free H2O and was custom ordered (Teknova, Hollister, CA). This recipe was initially provided by Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS). Protease inhibitors, 1:100 of 0.1 M phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride solution in ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) and 1:100 of complete EDTA-free tablets (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), were added to the lysis buffer kept on ice. After thawing on ice, approximately 1/2 of the TA tissue was isolated using a scalpel, weighed and immediately added to 650 uL protein lysis buffer. Each sample was homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4 C and at 14,000 X g to remove cell debris. A 30 uL sample of each supernatant was kept on ice for total protein concentration assay, and the rest of the supernatant was snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen in aliquots. The Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to measure the total protein concentration of each protein sample.     Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility using the following SUMS protocol:  25 uL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0 was added to each sample, followed by 1.5 uL of 500 mM DTT, incubated at 50 C for 30 minutes and cooled to room temperature. 3 uL of 1 M propionamide was added to each sample and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. 75 uL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 0.02 % protease max was added to each sample followed by 1.5 ug of trypsin/lysC (Promega) and overnight incubation at 37 C.  10 uL of 10 % formic acid, 90 % water was added to each sample to quench the digest. The samples were incubated at 37 C for 10 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 5 minutes. Microspin C18 columns (NEST group, p/n SEM SS18V) were equilibrated with acetonitrile followed by 2 times wash with 0.1 % formic acid/water and each sample was cleaned and concentrated independently per vendor protocol. The eluant peptides were dried in a speed vac to less than 2 uL volume and stored at 4 C prior to TMT isobaric labeling. Each peptide pool was reconstituted in 100 uL, 100 mM HEPES, pH 8.0. The TMT isobaric labels were reconstituted in 40 uL absolute ethyl alcohol and 20 uL of each isobaric tag as described above was added to the corresponding sample. The samples incubated at room temperature for 1.5 hr, followed by the addition of 5 uL hydroxylamine to quench the reaction. 50 uL of each isobaric-tagged peptide pool was drawn and pooled to a final volume of 500 uL, 500 uL of 0.1 % formic acid water was added to a final volume of 1 mL. This fraction ( around 250 ug total peptide) was purified on a Water Oasis HLB 3cc C18 cartridge per vendor protocol and the final eluent dried to completion in a speed vac. SCX offline fractionation was performed using a Protea SCX column (p/n SP-155) and the provided buffers. In brief, the previously dried 10plex peptide pool was dissolved in 150 uL reconstitution solution and loaded onto the equilibrated SCX column (3 times) followed by 2 sequential washes. The elution solution provided in the kit was diluted in series to 50 mM, 100 mM, 150 mM, 200 mM, 300 mM and 400 mM (stock) concentrations. The peptides were then eluted starting with the 50mM salt concentration and collected in a new tube for the entire series. 200 uL of 0.1 % formic acid water was added to each SCX eluted fraction and each was Microspin C18 purified as previously described. Each fraction was reconstituted in 20 uL 0.2 % formic acid, 2 % acetonitrile, 97.8 % water and injected for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. Samples were divided in two TMT 10-plex labeling groups. Run 1 includes M23, M24, M25, M33, M34 and M35, and Run 2 includes M26, M27, M28, M36, M37, M38. Both runs also include four pooled samples: pool of all flight samples, pool of all ground control samples, pool of all flight and ground control samples and one empty channel.     Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility using the Thermo Orbitrap Fusion MS.     1/2 of the TA tissue was weighed and immediately placed in 300 ul of the homogenization buffer included in the PrepEase Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (USB, Cleveland, OH) and DNA isolation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The DNA pellets were resuspended in 50 ul of DNA Resuspension Buffer. Concentration and absorbance ratios for DNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).     Aliquots of each DNA sample was bisulfite-converted with the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold kit (Zymo Research). Sequencing libraries was generated from the converted DNA sample with the EpiGnome Methyl-Seq kit (Epicentre). The resulting libraries were QC-ed by bioanalyzer and quantified by fluorometric Qubic measurements and RT-PCR.     The BS-sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 at UC Davis Genome Center. Each library was sequenced on one HiSeq lane by itself with paired end 150bp reads.     Merged fastq files were generated by concatenating the forward and reverse raw reads data for each sample into one forward and one reverse fastq file per sample. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and reports were combined with MultiQC (version 1.22.1).     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7113 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/DEV_Methyl-Seq/Methyl-Seq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7113_Versions/GL-DPPD-7113.md). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.8). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus Bismark references were built using Bismark (version 0.24.2) and Bowtie2 (version 2.5.4), with the Ensembl release 112, genome version GRCm39 reference (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus Bismark reference using Bismark (version 0.24.2) and Bowtie2 (version 2.5.4), the aligned data were sorted with samtools (version 1.21), and alignment quality was assessed with QualiMap (version 2.3). Bismark (version 0.24.2) was used to deduplicate the aligned (unsorted) data, then methylation calls were extracted from the deduplicated aligned data, and bismark reports were generated for each sample with Bismark (version 0.24.2). Bismark reports for each sample were combined into a bismark summary report with Bismark (version 0.24.2). Alignment qualiMap reports and Bismark reports were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). A runsheet containing sample group information was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and imported into R (version 4.4.2), and methylation call data was imported into R using methylkit (version 1.32.0). Pair-wise differential methylation analysis was performed in R at both the base and tile level using methylkit (version 1.32.0). Gene annotations were assigned to the differential methylation results using genomation (version 1.38.0) and custom annotation tables generated using UCSC gtfToGenePred (version 469) and UCSC genePredToBed (version 469) from the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf (Ensembl release 112).",

          "Study Description": "NASA's Rodent Research (RR) project is playing a critical role in advancing biomedical research on the physiological effects of space environments. Due to the limited resources for conducting biological experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS), it is imperative to use crew time efficiently while maximizing high-quality science return. NASA's GeneLab project has as its primary objectives to 1) further increase the value of these experiments using a multi-omics, systems biology-based approach, and 2) disseminate these data without restrictions to the scientific community. The current investigation assessed viability of RNA, DNA, and protein extracted from archived RR-1 tissue samples for epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic assays. During the first RR spaceflight experiment, a variety of tissue types were harvested from subjects, snap-frozen or RNAlater-preserved, and then stored at least a year at -80C after return to Earth. They were then prioritized for this investigation based on likelihood of significant scientific value for spaceflight research. All tissues were made available to GeneLab through the bio-specimen sharing program managed by the Ames Life Science Data Archive and included mouse adrenal glands, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, soleus, eye, and kidney. We report here protocols for and results of these tissue extractions, and thus, the feasibility and value of these kinds of omics analyses. In addition to providing additional opportunities for investigation of spaceflight effects on the mouse transcriptome and proteome in new kinds of tissues, our results may also be of value to program managers for the prioritization of ISS crew time for rodent research activities.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "A cohort of 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Lab) were flown to the ISS, housed in the Rodent Habitat and were subjected to microgravity for 37 days. Mice of simiar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council, 2011) and was approved on May 21, 2014 by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at NASA Ames Research Center and Kennedy Space Center (Protocol number NAS-13-002-Y1).     The flight group mice were euthanized by ISS crew with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation. Spleen and liver samples were collected upon euthanasia for mice M21 and M22, and the dissected carcasses were frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C). For the rest of the mice, the carcasses were frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C) and brought back to Earth where disscetion was held. Ground control mice M31 and M32 followed the same protocol of on-orbit dissected animals (M21 and M22). Postflight dissection: all the mouse carcasses, including dissected and intact carcasses, were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes. Multiple tissues, including left and right extensor digitorum longus muscles, were collected from each carcass. Total dissection time for each carcass was no longer than 30 minutes since collection of the first tissue. Left and right extensor digitorum longus muscles were harvested and stored separately overnight at 4 C in RNAlater, then transferred into a -80 C freezer.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei).

Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://visualization.osdr.nasa.gov/eda/.     RNA and DNA were extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, homogenization buffer for DNA and RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and kept on ice until use. After thawing on ice, left and right adrenals were weighed together and immediately placed in 800 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at room temperature at 15,000 RPM to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer's protocol. DNA was eluted twice per sample in 50 uL H2O per elution. RNA was eluted twice per sample in 30 uL H2O per elution. Concentration and absorbance ratios for all DNA and RNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     DNA sequencing library construction was performed by UC Davis Genome Center. Aliquots of each DNA sample was bisulfite-converted with the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold kit (Zymo Research). Sequencing libraries was generated from the converted DNA sample with the EpiGnome Methyl-Seq kit (Epicentre). The resulting libraries were QC-ed by bioanalyzer and quantified by fluorometric Qubic measurements and RT-PCR.     The RNA library sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. The libraries were sequenced across multiple sequencing runs at 100bp and 150bp paired end reads. Performed by UC Davis Genome Center. The BS-sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 at UC Davis Genome Center. Each library was sequenced on one HiSeq lane by itself with paired end 150bp reads.     RNA sequencing library construction was perfromed by UC Davis Genome Center using the Illumina TruSeq stranded RNA library prep kit after ribo-depletion. The libraries were QC-ed by bioanalyzer and quantified by fluorometric Qubit measurements.     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.2 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.2/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1).",

          "Study Description": "NASA's Rodent Research (RR) project is playing a critical role in advancing biomedical research on the physiological effects of space environments. Due to the limited resources for conducting biological experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS), it is imperative to use crew time efficiently while maximizing high-quality science return. NASA's GeneLab project has as its primary objectives to 1) further increase the value of these experiments using a multi-omics, systems biology-based approach, and 2) disseminate these data without restrictions to the scientific community. The current investigation assessed viability of RNA, DNA, and protein extracted from archived RR-1 tissue samples for epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic assays. During the first RR spaceflight experiment, a variety of tissue types were harvested from subjects, snap-frozen or RNAlater-preserved, and then stored at least a year at -80C after return to Earth. They were then prioritized for this investigation based on likelihood of significant scientific value for spaceflight research. All tissues were made available to GeneLab through the bio-specimen sharing program managed by the Ames Life Science Data Archive and included mouse adrenal glands, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, soleus, eye, and kidney. We report here protocols for and results of these tissue extractions, and thus, the feasibility and value of these kinds of omics analyses. In addition to providing additional opportunities for investigation of spaceflight effects on the mouse transcriptome and proteome in new kinds of tissues, our results may also be of value to program managers for the prioritization of ISS crew time for rodent research activities.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "A cohort of 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Lab) were flown to the ISS, housed in the Rodent Habitat and were subjected to microgravity for 37 days. Mice of simiar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. The mice were euthanized by ISS crew with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation, frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C) and brought back to Earth. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     The mouse carcasses were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes. Multiple tissues, including left and right eyes, were collected from each animal. Total dissection time for each carcass was no longer than 30 minutes since collection of the first tissue. Left and right eyes were harvested and stored separately overnight at 4 C in RNAlater, then transferred to -80 C. (In this study, only left eye tissue was analyzed)     RNA and DNA were extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, homogenization buffer for DNA and RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 volumes of beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and kept on ice until use. After thawing on ice, left eyes were weighed and immediately placed in 800 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at room temperature at 15,000 RPM to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer protocol. DNA was eluted twice per sample in 50 uL H2O per elution. RNA was eluted twice per sample in 30 uL H2O per elution. Concentration and absorbance ratios for all DNA and RNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     RNA sequencing library construction was performed by UC Davis Genome Center using the Illumina TruSeq standard RNA library prep kit after ribo-depletion. The libraries were QC-ed by bioanalyzer and quantified by fluorometric Qubit measurements.     DNA sequencing library construction was performed by UC Davis Genome Center. Aliquots of each DNA sample was bisulfite-converted with the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold kit (Zymo Research). Sequencing libraries was generated from the converted DNA sample with the EpiGnome Methyl-Seq kit (Epicentre). The resulting libraries were QC-ed by bioanalyzer and quantified by fluorometric Qubic measurements and RT-PCR.     The RNA library sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform, three high output HiSeq lanes with 100 bp paired end stranded reads and index reads. 30 million reads per sample was requested. Performed by UC Davis Genome Center. The BS-sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 at UC Davis Genome Center. Each library was sequenced on one HiSeq lane by itself with paired end 150bp reads     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0). Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8) and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 96, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the GeneLab Reference Annotations pipeline (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0). Processing scripts used can be found on GitHub here: https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/RNAseq/GLDS_Processing_Scripts/GLDS-100/GLDS_version_5",

Mice of simiar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council, 2011) and was approved on May 21, 2014 by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at NASA Ames Research Center and Kennedy Space Center (Protocol number NAS-13-002-Y1).     The flight group mice were euthanized by ISS crew with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation. Spleen and liver samples were collected upon euthanasia for mice M21 and M22, and the dissected carcasses were frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C). For the rest of the mice, the carcasses were frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C) and brought back to Earth where disscetion was held. Ground control mice M31 and M32 followed the same protocol of on-orbit dissected animals (M21 and M22). Postflight dissection: all the mouse carcasses, including dissected and intact carcasses, were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes. Multiple tissues, including left and right adrenal glands, were collected from each carcass. Total dissection time for each carcass was no longer than 30 minutes since collection of the first tissue. Left and right adrenal glands were harvested and stored together overnight at 4 C in RNAlater, then transferred into a -80 C freezer.

Each library was sequenced on one HiSeq lane by itself with paired end 150bp reads.     For protein homogenization the urea based protein lysis buffer consisted of 8 M urea, with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, at pH 8.5 in DNase- and RNase-free H2O and was custom ordered (Teknova, Hollister, CA). This recipe was initially provided by Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS). Protease inhibitors, 1:100 of 0.1 M phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride solution in ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) and 1:100 of complete EDTA-free tablets (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), were added to the lysis buffer kept on ice. After thawing on ice, left and right adrenals were weighed together and immediately added to 650 uL protein lysis buffer. Each sample was homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4 C and at 14,000 X g to remove cell debris. A 30 uL sample of each supernatant was kept on ice for total protein concentration assay, and the rest of the supernatant was snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen in aliquots. The Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to measure the total protein concentration of each protein sample.     Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility using the following SUMS protocol:  25 uL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0 was added to each sample, followed by 1.5 uL of 500 mM DTT, incubated at 50C for 30 minutes and cooled to room temperature. 3 uL of 1 M propionamide was added to each sample and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. 75 uL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 0.02 % protease max was added to each sample followed by 1.5 ug of trypsin/lysC (Promega) and overnight incubation at 37C.  10 uL of 10 % formic acid, 90 % water was added to each sample to quench the digest. The samples were incubated at 37 C for 10 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 minutes. Microspin C18 columns (NEST group, p/n SEM SS18V) were equilibrated with acetonitrile followed by 2 times wash with 0.1 % formic acid/water and each sample was cleaned and concentrated independently per vendor protocol. The eluant peptides were dried in a speed vac to <2 uL volume and stored at 4 C prior to TMT isobaric labeling. Each peptide pool was reconstituted in 100 uL, 100 mM HEPES, pH 8.0. The TMT isobaric labels were reconstituted in 40 uL absolute ethyl alcohol and 20 uL of each isobaric tag as described above was added to the corresponding sample. The samples incubated at room temperature for 1.5 hr, followed by the addition of 5 uL hydroxylamine to quench the reaction. 50 uL of each isobaric-tagged peptide pool was drawn and pooled to a final volume of 500 uL, 500 uL of 0.1 % formic acid water was added to a final volume of 1 mL. This fraction (~250 ug total peptide) was purified on a Water Oasis HLB 3cc C18 cartridge per vendor protocol and the final eluent dried to completion in a speed vac. SCX offline fractionation was performed using a Protea SCX column (p/n SP-155) and the provided buffers. In brief, the previously dried 10plex peptide pool was dissolved in 150 uL reconstitution solution and loaded onto the equilibrated SCX column (3 times) followed by 2 sequential washes. The elution solution provided in the kit was diluted in series to 50 mM, 100 mM, 150 mM, 200 mM, 300 mM and 400 mM (stock) concentrations. The peptides were then eluted starting with the 50 mM salt concentration and collected in a new tube for the entire series. 200 uL of 0.1 % formic acid water was added to each SCX eluted fraction and each was Microspin C18 purified as previously described. Each fraction was reconstituted in 20 uL 0.2 % formic acid, 2% acetonitrile, 97.8% water and injected for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis.     Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility using the Thermo Orbitrap Fusion MS.      Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 96, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the GeneLab Reference Annotations pipeline (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0). Processing scripts used can be found on GitHub here: https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/RNAseq/GLDS_Processing_Scripts/GLDS-98/GLDS_version_8     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped.

          "Study Protocol Description": "A cohort of 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Lab) were flown to the ISS, housed in the Rodent Habitat and were subjected to microgravity for 37 days. Mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council, 2011) and was approved on May 21, 2014 by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at NASA Ames Research Center and Kennedy Space Center (Protocol number NAS-13-002-Y1).     The mice were euthanized by ISS crew with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation, frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C) and brought back to Earth. The mouse carcasses were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes. Multiple tissues, including left and right kidneys, were collected from each carcass. Total dissection time for each carcass was no longer than 30 minutes since collection of the first tissue. After harvesting, left and right kidneys were stored separately overnight at 4 C in RNAlater, then transferred into a -80 C freezer.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://www.nasa.gov/reference/osdr-environmental-data/.     For protein homogenization the urea based protein lysis buffer consisted of 8M urea, with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, at pH 8.5 in DNase- and RNase-free H2O and was custom ordered (Teknova, Hollister, CA). This recipe was initially provided by Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS). Protease inhibitors, 1:100 of 0.1 M phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride solution in ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) and 1:100 of complete EDTA-free tablets (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), were added to the lysis buffer kept on ice. After thawing on ice and using a scalpel, approximately 1/3 of kidney tissue was weighed and immediately added to 650 uL protein lysis buffer. Each sample was homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4 C and at 14,000 X g to remove cell debris. A 30 uL sample of each supernatant was kept on ice for total protein concentration assay, and the rest of the supernatant was snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen in aliquots. The Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to measure the total protein concentration of each protein sample.     Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility using the following SUMS protocol: 25uL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0 was added to each sample, followed by 1.5 uL of 500 mM DTT, incubated at 50 C for 30 minutes and cooled to room temperature. 3 uL of 1 M propionamide was added to each sample and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. 75 uL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 0.02 % protease max was added to each sample followed by 1.5 ug of trypsin/lysC (Promega) and overnight incubation at 37 C.  10 uL of 10 % formic acid, 90 % water was added to each sample to quench the digest. The samples were incubated at 37 C for 10 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 5 minutes. Microspin C18 columns (NEST group, p/n SEM SS18V) were equilibrated with acetonitrile followed by 2 times wash with 0.1 % formic acid/water and each sample was cleaned and concentrated independently per vendor protocol. The eluant peptides were dried in a speed vac to <2 uL volume and stored at 4 C prior to TMT isobaric labeling. Each peptide pool was reconstituted in 100 uL, 100 mM HEPES, pH 8.0. The TMT isobaric labels were reconstituted in 40 uL absolute ethyl alcohol and 20 uL of each isobaric tag as described above was added to the corresponding sample. The samples incubated at room temperature for 1.5 hr, followed by the addition of 5 uL hydroxylamine to quench the reaction. 50 uL of each isobaric-tagged peptide pool was drawn and pooled to a final volume of 500 uL, 500 uL of 0.1 % formic acid water was added to a final volume of 1 mL. This fraction (~250 ug total peptide) was purified on a Water Oasis HLB 3cc C18 cartridge per vendor protocol and the final eluent dried to completion in a speed vac. SCX offline fractionation was performed using a Protea SCX column (p/n SP-155) and the provided buffers. In brief, the previously dried 10-plex peptide pool was dissolved in 150 uL reconstitution solution and loaded onto the equilibrated SCX column (3 times) followed by 2 sequential washes. The elution solution provided in the kit was diluted in series to 50 mM, 100 mM, 150 mM, 200 mM, 300 mM and 400 mM (stock) concentrations. The peptides were then eluted starting with the 50mM salt concentration and collected in a new tube for the entire series. 200 uL of 0.1 % formic acid water was added to each SCX eluted fraction and each was Microspin C18 purified as previously described. Each fraction was reconstituted in 20 uL 0.2 % formic acid, 2 % acetonitrile, 97.8 % water and injected for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis.  Samples were divided in two TMT 10-plex labeling groups. Run 1 includes M23, M24, M25, M33, M34 and M35, and Run 2 includes M26, M27, M28, M36, M37, M38. Both runs also included four pooled samples: pool of all six flight samples, pool of all six ground control samples, pool of all twelve flight and ground control samples and one empty channel.     Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility using the Thermo Orbitrap Fusion MS.     RNA and DNA were extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, homogenization buffer for DNA and RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 volumes of beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and kept on ice until use. After thawing on ice, approximately 1/3 of the kidney tissue was isolated using a scalpel, weighed and immediately placed in 800 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at room temperature at 15,000 RPM to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer's protocol. DNA was eluted twice per sample in 50 uL H2O per elution. RNA was eluted twice per sample in 30 uL H2O per elution. Concentration and absorbance ratios for all DNA and RNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     DNA sequencing library construction was performed by UC Davis Genome Center. Aliquots of each DNA sample was bisulfite-converted with the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold kit (Zymo Research). Sequencing libraries was generated from the converted DNA sample with the EpiGnome Methyl-Seq kit (Epicentre). The resulting libraries were QAC-ed by bioanalyzer and quantified by fluorometric Qubic measurements and RT-PCR.     The RNA library sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. The libraries were sequenced across two sequencing runs at 100bp and 150bp paired end reads.  Performed by UC Davis Genome Center.   The BS-sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 at UC Davis Genome Center. Each library was sequenced on one HiSeq lane by itself with paired end 150bp reads.     RNA sequencing library construction was performed by UC Davis Genome Center using the Illumina TruSeq stranded RNA library prep kit after ribo-deplpetion. The libraries were QC-ed by bioanalyzer and quantified by fluorometric Qubit measurements.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.0 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.0/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.5) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1).     RNA methylation analysis was performed by Epigentek. 60 samples of Total mouse kidney RNA was prepared by GeneLab and received by Epigentek. The samples were subjected to bisulfite conversion, cDNA reverse transcription, library preparation, Bioanalyzer QC, KAPA library quantification, multiplex NGS on an Illumina HiSeq2500 and advanced data analysis.  Bisulfite Conversion: RNA samples were bisulfite treated with the Methylamp RNA Bisulfite Conversion Kit Kit (Epigentek Cat. # P-9003). 200 ng for the samples N1, N2, N4 through N12, and N37 through N60. 100 ng for the samples N3 and N13 through N36.  Library Preparation: -cDNA was synthesized from bisulfite treated RNA and ligated with adaptors by using random probing method. -Library amplification was performed using indexed primers and library cDNA was purified with magnetic beads -Purified library cDNA was eluted in 12 uL of water.  Library QC: Library construction was verified on a Bioanalyzer and KAPA Library Quantification.  Sequencing: 5 nM of sample libraries were subjected to next generation sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 in Single Read 50 nts format.     Data analysis was performed by Epigentek, and the detailed analysis workflow is provided in the Supplemental Materials.",

Mice of simiar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. The mice were euthanized by ISS crew with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation, frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C) and brought back to Earth. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     The mouse carcasses were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes.  Multiple tissues, including left quadriceps muscle, were collected from each carcass. Total dissection time for each carcass was no longer than 30 minutes since collection of the first tissue. Left quadriceps muscle was harvested, cut in half with a scalpel, and snap frozen separately with liquid nitrogen.     For protein homogenization the urea based protein lysis buffer consisted of 8M urea, with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, at pH 8.5 in DNase- and RNase-free H2O and was custom ordered (Teknova, Hollister, CA). This recipe was initially provided by Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS). Protease inhibitors, 1:100 of 0.1 M phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride solution in ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) and 1:100 of complete EDTA-free tablets (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), were added to the lysis buffer kept on ice. After thawing on ice, approximately 1/4 of total quad tissue was isolated using a scalpel, weighed, and immediately added to 650 uL protein lysis buffer. Each sample was homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4 C and at 14,000 X g to remove cell debris. A 30 uL sample of each supernatant was kept on ice for total protein concentration assay, and the rest of the supernatant was snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen in aliquots. The Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to measure the total protein concentration of each protein sample.     Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility using the following SUMS protocol:  25 uL of 50mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0 was added to each sample, followed by 1.5 uL of 500mM DTT, incubated at 50C for 30 minutes and cooled to room temperature. 3 uL of 1M propionamide was added to each sample and incubated at room temperature for 1hr. 75 uL of 50mM ammonium bicarbonate, 0.02% protease max was added to each sample followed by 1.5 ug of trypsin/lysC (Promega) and overnight incubation at 37C.  10 uL of 10% formic acid, 90% water was added to each sample to quench the digest. The samples were incubated at 37C for 10 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 10,000g for 5 minutes. Microspin C18 columns (NEST group, p/n SEM SS18V) were equilibrated with acetonitrile followed by 2 times wash with 0.1% formic acid/water and each sample was cleaned and concentrated independently per vendor protocol. The eluant peptides were dried in a speed vac to <2 uL volume and stored at 4C prior to TMT isobaric labeling. Each peptide pool was reconstituted in 100 uL, 100mM HEPES, pH 8.0. The TMT isobaric labels were reconstituted in 40 uL absolute ethyl alcohol and 20 uL of each isobaric tag as described above was added to the corresponding sample. The samples incubated at room temperature for 1.5hr, followed by the addition of 5 uL hydroxylamine to quench the reaction. 50 uL of each isobaric-tagged peptide pool was drawn and pooled to a final volume of 500 uL, 500 uL of 0.1% formic acid water was added to a final volume of 1mL. This fraction (~250 ug total peptide) was purified on a Water Oasis HLB 3cc C18 cartridge per vendor protocol and the final eluent dried to completion in a speed vac. SCX offline fractionation was performed using a Protea SCX column (p/n SP-155) and the provided buffers. In brief, the previously dried 10plex peptide pool was dissolved in 150 uL reconstitution solution and loaded onto the equilibrated SCX column (3 times) followed by 2 sequential washes. The elution solution provided in the kit was diluted in series to 50mM, 100mM, 150mM, 200mM, 300mM and 400mM (stock) concentrations. The peptides were then eluted starting with the 50mM salt concentration and collected in a new tube for the entire series. 200 uL of 0.1% formic acid water was added to each SCX eluted fraction and each was Microspin C18 purified as previously described. Each fraction was reconstituted in 20 uL 0.2% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile, 97.8% water and injected for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis.  Samples were divided in two TMT 10-plex labeling groups. Run 1 includes M23, M24, M25, M33, M34 and M35, and Run 2 includes M26, M27, M28, M36, M37, M38. Both runs also include four pooled samples: pool of all flight samples, pool of all ground control samples, pool of all flight and ground control samples and one empty channel.     Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility using the Thermo Orbitrap Fusion MS.     TRIzol protocol: After thawing on ice and using a scalpel, approximately 1/4 of total quad tissue was weighed and immediately placed in 1 ml of the TRIzol solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 X g for 10 minutes at 4 C to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate RNA following the manufacturer's protocol. The isolated RNA was then purified on column with DNAse I (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valenica, CA). The purified RNA was eluted in 30 uL H2O. Concentration and absorbance ratios for RNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).  PrepEase protocol: After thawing on ice and using a scalpel, approximately 1/4 of tissue was cut, weighed and immediately placed in 300 ul of the homogenization buffer included in the PrepEase Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (USB, Cleveland, OH) and DNA isolation was performed following the manufacturer's protocol. The DNA pellets were resuspended in 50 ul of DNA Resuspension Buffer. Concentration and absorbance ratios for DNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).     RNA methylation analysis was performed by Epigentek. 60 samples of Total mouse quadriceps RNA was prepared by GeneLab and received by Epigentek. The samples were subjected to bisulfite conversion, cDNA reverse transcription, library preparation, Bioanalyzer QC, KAPA library quantification, multiplex NGS on an Illumina HiSeq2500 and advanced data analysis.  Bisulfite Conversion: RNA samples were bisulfite treated with the Methylamp RNA Bisulfite Conversion Kit Kit (Epigentek Cat.   P-9003). 200 ng for the samples N1, N2, N4 through N12, and N37 through N60. 100 ng for the samples N3 and N13 through N36.  Library Preparation: -cDNA was synthesized from bisulfite treated RNA and ligated with adaptors by using random probing method. -Library amplification was performed using indexed primers and library cDNA was purified with magnetic beads -Purified library cDNA was eluted in 12 uL of water.  Library QC: Library construction was verified on a Bioanalyzer and KAPA Library Quantification.  Sequencing: 5 nM of sample libraries were subjected to next generation sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 in Single Read 50 nts format.     DNA sequencing library construction was performed by UC Davis Genome Center. Aliquots of each DNA sample was bisulfite-converted with the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold kit (Zymo Research). Sequencing libraries was generated from the converted DNA sample with the EpiGnome Methyl-Seq kit (Epicentre). The resulting libraries were QAC-ed by bioanalyzer and quantified by fluorometric Qubic measurements and RT-1PCR.     The RNA library sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform by UC Davis Genome Center. The libraries were sequenced across multiple sequencing runs at 100bp and 150bp paired end reads. The BS-sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 at UC Davis Genome Center. Each library was sequenced on one HiSeq lane by itself with paired end 150bp reads.     Merged fastq files were generated by concatenating the forward and reverse raw reads data for each sample into one forward and one reverse fastq file per sample. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and reports were combined with MultiQC (version 1.26).     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7113 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/DEV_Methyl-Seq/Methyl-Seq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7113_Versions/GL-DPPD-7113.md). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.8). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus Bismark references were built using Bismark (version 0.24.2) and Bowtie2 (version 2.5.4), with the Ensembl release 112, genome version GRCm39 reference (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus Bismark reference using Bismark (version 0.24.2) and Bowtie2 (version 2.5.4), the aligned data were sorted with samtools (version 1.21), and alignment quality was assessed with QualiMap (version 2.3). Bismark (version 0.24.2) was used to deduplicate the aligned (unsorted) data, then methylation calls were extracted from the deduplicated aligned data, and bismark reports were generated for each sample with Bismark (version 0.24.2). Bismark reports for each sample were combined into a bismark summary report with Bismark (version 0.24.2). Alignment qualiMap reports and Bismark reports were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). A runsheet containing sample group information was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and imported into R (version 4.4.2), and methylation call data was imported into R using methylkit (version 1.32.0). Pair-wise differential methylation analysis was performed in R at both the base and tile level using methylkit (version 1.32.0). Gene annotations were assigned to the differential methylation results using genomation (version 1.38.0) and custom annotation tables generated using UCSC gtfToGenePred (version 469) and UCSC genePredToBed (version 469) from the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf (Ensembl release 112).     RNA sequencing library construction was performed by UC Davis Genome Center using the Illumina TruSeq stranded RNA library prep kit after ribo-depletion. The libraries were QC-ed by bioanalyzer and quantified by fluorometric Qubit measurements.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0). Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.2 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.2/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1).",

          "Study Description": "NASA's Rodent Research (RR) project is playing a critical role in advancing biomedical research on the physiological effects of space environments. Due to the limited resources for conducting biological experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS), it is imperative to use crew time efficiently while maximizing high-quality science return. NASA's GeneLab project has as its primary objectives to 1) further increase the value of these experiments using a multi-omics, systems biology-based approach, and 2) disseminate these data without restrictions to the scientific community. The current investigation assessed viability of RNA, DNA, and protein extracted from archived RR-1 tissue samples for epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic assays. During the first RR spaceflight experiment, a variety of tissue types were harvested from subjects, snap-frozen or RNAlater-preserved, and then stored at least a year at -80C after return to Earth. They were then prioritized for this investigation based on likelihood of significant scientific value for spaceflight research. All tissues were made available to GeneLab through the bio-specimen sharing program managed by the Ames Life Science Data Archive and included mouse adrenal glands, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, soleus, eye, and kidney. We report here protocols for and results of these tissue extractions, and thus, the feasibility and value of these kinds of omics analyses. In addition to providing additional opportunities for investigation of spaceflight effects on the mouse transcriptome and proteome in new kinds of tissues, our results may also be of value to program managers for the prioritization of ISS crew time for rodent research activities.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Total RNA was isolated from mouse soleus (n = 3) and EDL (n = 3) muscles of each experimental group (BF, BG and FC) using a two step isolation protocol: modified Chomczinsky extraction followed by column purification (RNeasy micro Kit, Qiagen, Hilden,Germany).     The amplification and labeling of 100 ng of the RNA samples were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) using the GeneChip 3' IVT Express Protocol.     15 ug of each labeled and fragmented cRNA sample was hybridized for 16 hours at 45C to an Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse 430A 2.0 Array.     Arrays were scanned at 1.56-um resolution using the Affymetrix GeneChip System confocal scanner 3000.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.5 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.5/Microarray/Affymetrix/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAffymetrix). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.4). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using oligo (version 1.58.0). Raw data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). The raw probe level intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the oligo (version 1.58.0) quantile method. Normalized probe level data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). Normalized probe level data was summarized to the probeset level using the oligo (version 1.58.0) RMA method. Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probeset using biomaRt (version 2.50.0), Ensembl database (ensembl.org, release 107). Gene annotations were assigned for every probeset that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).     C57BL/N6 mice (22 - 25 g) were purchased from the Animal Breeding Facility Branch of Shemyakin and Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russia. Mice were transported to the animal facility of Moscow State University, Institute of Mitoengineering, for preadaptation training and selection in the laboratory setting on the ground before flight. For all experiments, 19 - 20 weeks old male mice were used. In detail, following a preflight animal training and pre-selection program (e.g., pre-adaptation to standard laboratory cage conditions and familiarization of individual mice groups compliant for housing in smaller animal flight habitats used for spaceflight mission as previously proposed), mice were randomly divided in 3 groups: mice to be flown aboard the BION-M1 biosatellite exposed for 30 days to microgravity (BION Flown equals BF), mice housed for 30 days under the same biosatellite bio-parameters (i.e., number of animals per group and identical housing conditions in a BION-M1 used habitat) on ground (BION Ground equals BG), and mice housed in the animal facility of Moscow State University (Institute of Mitoengineering) concomitant to the duration of the biosatellite flight (FC equals Flight Control). Before launch to space, mice were pre-adapted for 2 weeks on the ground to a special diet later provided in their space habitats. Thus, BF (flown mice) and BG (ground control mice) mice were fed with space paste food including all necessary major nutrients comparable to standard chow and water developed by the Institute for Biomedical Problems (IBMP, Moscow), while FC mice were fed with standard chow and water ab libitum. Food and water intake within the different experimental groups were previously reported by Andreev-Andrievskiy and co-workers. After landing, mice were transferred in the BION-M1 housing device within 12 - 14 hrs from the landing site (Kazakhstan) to Moscow Institute of Biomedical Problems (IMBP), Russia.     Operational support with preflight animal handling, post flight animal tissue dissection and sample freezing was accomplished by our Russian contracted partners on site (IMBP, Moscow, Russia, contract # BION-M1/2013 between RF SRC-IMBP and Charite Berlin, Germany). All samples were delivered deeply frozen on dry ice from IMBP Moscow via temperature controlled express delivery parcels (World Courier Express) to the Charite Berlin, Germany, and further processed in our laboratory.     On-board dosimetry details including schematics are available at: https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/environmental/radiation/BION-M1/.\n\nSummary dosimetry is given per sample. Ground Control samples were assumed to have had background radiation exposure, but exposure not actually measured.",

The aim of this study was to investigate, at both morphological and global gene expression level, skeletal muscle adaptation to microgravity in mouse soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL). Adult male mice C57BL/N6 were flown aboard the BION-M1 biosatellite for 30 days on orbit (BF) or housed in a replicate flight habitat on Earth (BG) as reference flight control. In this study, we investigated for the first time gene expression adaptation to 30 days of microgravity exposure in mouse soleus and EDL, highlighting potential new targets for improvement of countermeasures able to ameliorate or even prevent microgravity-induced atrophy in future spaceflights. Overall Design: C57BL/N6 mice were randomly divided in 3 groups: Bion Flown (BF), mice flown aboard the Bion M1 biosatellite in microgravity environment for 30 days; Bion Ground (BG), mice housed in the same habitat of flown animals but exposed to earth gravity; and Flight Control (FC), mice housed in a standard animal facility.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Mice were flown onboard STS-135 that lifted off at 11:29 am EDT on July 8, 2011 and landed at 5:57 am on July 21, 2011. The mission duration was 12 days, 18 hours, 28 minutes.\n\nFemale 9 to 11 week-old C57BL/6CR mice were assigned to one of two experimental groups: Flight (FLT) and Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) ground controls. The flight animals were housed in AEMs identical to the ground controls, and our analysis focuses on the comparison between these two conditions.\n\nThe AEM was located in the middeck locker of the Space Shuttle, and the temperature was set at 3 to 8C above the environmental middeck temperature. Lighting of 14 lux was set to a 12 hour day/12 hour night cycle for both FLT and AEM habitats.     The absorbed dose from ionizing radiation received by the flight specimens was estimated using TLD passive dosimeters located in the middeck of the space shuttle, where the payload was located. More specifically, we computed the average between three dosimeters (DLOC1, DLOC2, and DLOC3) for the mission and we divided it by the total duration of the mission to estimate the average absorbed dose rate in mGy/day. This dose rate did not include any shielding effects from the hardware where the specimens resided. The total absorbed dose in water was then computed by simply multiplying the average dose rate with the duration of the experiment. The duration of the experiment was defined as the time in space during which the specimen was 'living'. Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. A table with these detailed computations for all space shuttle datasets is available on GeneLab at https://www.nasa.gov/reference/osdr-environmental-data/.  The ground samples were not assessed for radiation exposure.     Both eyes from three animals for each group (n equals 3) were used in this study, one for gene expression analysis and the other for histology. After euthanasia at day one of landing, one eye of each mouse was enucleated and fixed for histologic examination. The contralateral eye was placed in RNA preservative (RNAlater) until further dissection, which was performed by making an incision by scalpel to separate the posterior eye cup, removing the lens and vitreous and carefully scraping the retina. The retina was then placed again in RNAlater and processed for gene expression profiling by microarray analysis.     Total RNA was then isolated from the retina using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Micro kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and analyzed for quality using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA).     Microarray gene expression analysis was performed at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston Molecular Genomics Core. Please contact UTMB for protocol details.     Microarray gene expression analysis was performed at the\nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston Molecular Genomics Core using Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) with\nAffymetrix Expression Console and Transcriptome Analysis Console for secondary analysis.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.5 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.5/Microarray/Affymetrix/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAffymetrix). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.4). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using oligo (version 1.58.0). Raw data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). The raw probe level intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the oligo (version 1.58.0) quantile method. Normalized probe level data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). Normalized probe level data was summarized to the probeset level using the oligo (version 1.58.0) RMA method. Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probeset using biomaRt (version 2.50.0), Ensembl database (ensembl.org, release 107). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probeset to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned for every probeset that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "MinION Library Preparation\nAliquots of DNA for mouse, E. coli, and lambda libraries were sheared individually using Covaris  g-TUBEs  (Covaris,  Boston,  MA)  by  centrifugation  at  4,800  x g  for  2  min  to  produce fragments  that  were  predominantly  8  kb.  Fragmentation  was  verified  using  a  2100  Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Sheared mouse, E. coli, and lambda DNA samples were quantified using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and combined in equal abundances, targeting 1.5 ug total (0.5 ug each). Mixed DNA samples then underwent  treatment  to  repair  residual  nicks,  gaps,  and  blocked  3'  ends  using  Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) DNA Repair Mix (New England Biolabs), with modifications to the manufacturer's protocol to include a 0.5X Agencourt AMPure XP system magnetic bead clean-up (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Brea, CA) to remove small fragments of DNA.\n\nThe repaired DNA was then prepared for sequencing according to Oxford Nanopore Technologies™ procedure for the SQK-MAP-006 Kit. Following library preparation, individual samples were mixed with a 102 ng aliquot of pre-sequencing library (150 ul) with 162.5 ul of 2X running buffer, 6.5 ul fuel mix (Oxford  Nanopore Technologies) and 156 ul molecular-grade sterile deionized water to a total  volume of 450 ul. This volume was loaded into a 1 ml syringe and the syringe was capped. A total of 18  samples  were  prepared: nine flight samples and nine ground  control  samples.  Capped syringes containing the samples were packaged with an identical 1 ml syringe for potential bubble removal  and  syringe  tips  were  placed  inside  of  a  large  plastic  tube  to  facilitate  transport. After syringe loading, the tubes were stored at -80 C.\n\nPacBio RSII Library Preparation\nSingle  Molecule,  Real-Time  (SMRT)  sequencing  libraries  were  prepared  using  the SMRTbell  Template  Prep  Kit  1.0  (Pacific  Biosciences)  and  20  kb  Template  Preparation  Using  BluePippin  Size-Selection  System  protocol  (Pacific  Biosciences).  5 ug  of  each  sample were used.  Library quality and quantity were determined using an Agilent 2200 TapeStation and Qubit dsDNA  BR  Assay  (Life  Technologies),  respectively.\n\nIllumina MiSeq Library Preparation\nSequencing libraries were prepared from 1 ng of sample using the NexteraXT kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's protocol.  Libraries were indexed with dual 8-nt barcodes on each end  of  the  sequencing  amplicon.  In total, 4 dual-indexed DNA sequencing libraries were constructed, corresponding to lambda bacteriophage, E. coli, mouse, and an equimolar mixture of DNA from the 3 organisms. Libraries were quantitated using the Agilent Bioanalyzer and Qubit spectrophotometer.\n     Samples analyzed in this study contained sequence libraries prepared from mixtures of female mouse BALB/C (Zyagen, San Diego, CA),\nEscherichia coli K-12 (Zyagen), and N6-methyladenine-free bacteriophage lambda (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) genomic DNA.\n     Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION (v6)\nSequencing was  initiated  using  MAP_Lambda_Burn_In_Run_SQK_MAP006.py  protocol  selected  from  the  MinKNOW  software.  Real-time  communications  with  the  ISS  allowed  the  ground  control  flow cells  and  samples  to  be  retrieved,  temperatures  equilibrated,  and  injected  for  priming  and  final  sample loading in a synchronous manner.\n\nPacBio RSII\nSequencing  was  conducted  using  P6-C4 chemistry and a v3 SMRT Cell (Pacific Biosciences) at Weill Cornell Medicine\n\nIllumina MiSeq\nSequenced  on  an  Illumina MiSeq  as  a  1  x  160  base  pair  (bp)  single-end sequencing run. The approximate percentage of the run allocated to each library as determined by the quantified  input  concentration was 3%  for  lambda  bacteriophage,  17%  for E.  coli, 30%  for mouse, and 50% for the equimolar mixture.     The  nine  flight  samples  were  removed  from  the  -80 C  freezer,  placed  on  dry  ice  in  a  Styrofoam cooler, and shipped overnight to the launch processing facility at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Once at KSC, the samples were maintained in a -80 C freezer until transfer to the powered freezer on the SpaceX Dragon Capsule. To more closely approximate the handling of the flight samples, the nine ground control samples were also removed from the freezer, placed on dry ice in a Styrofoam cooler and allowed to sit on the laboratory bench for the same amount the time that the flight samples were out of the freezer during transit. Samples  were  maintained  within  the  launch  processing  labs  at  KSC until 48 h before the launch, at which point they were loaded onto the vehicle.\nThe  DNA  samples  were launched  in  a  powered  freezer  in  which temperatures were maintained between -80 and -90 C. Upon docking with the ISS, the flow cells and DNA samples were transferred to refrigerator (+2 to+8 C) and freezer (-80 to -90 C) dewars within the Minus Eighty Degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI), respectively. All other items were stored at ambient ISS conditions.     MinION data\nThe SURPIrt pipeline is a real-time analysis pipeline for automated metagenomic pathogen detection and reference-based genomic assembly from nanopore sequencing data. We simulated a real-time SURPIrt analysis of the NASA runs using both ground and in-flight nanopore data downloaded from the ISS. For the simulation, the SURPIrt pipeline was run in automated mode to continually scan a download directory containing raw FAST5/HDF files from the MinION sequencer for batch analysis. We used Minimap v0.2-r124-dirty and Miniasm v0.2-r137-dirty as described in the github tutorial, using 8 threads (https://github.com/lh3/miniasm). Two assemblies were generated, using reads that mapped exclusively to Escherichia coli K12 MG1655 using GraphMap from the four runs on the ISS, and all reads from the ISS that did not map to host organisms (human and mouse, using genomes hg38 and mm10). We then polished these assemblies using nanopolish v0.5.0. We used Canu v1.73 (20) at default parameters using a specified target genome size of 4.8 MB to de novo assemble contigs directly from in-flight nanopore data corresponding to the metagenomic mixture of mouse, E. coli, and lambda genomes. Runs were performed using both a 64-core computational server with 512 gigabytes (Gb) memory and an 8-hyperthreaded core laptop with 64 Gb memory. Four sets of de novo assemblies were generated: (1) in-flight runs 1-3 (n=46,871), (2) in-flight runs 1-4 (n=84,502), (3) in-flight runs 1-4 after removal of host M. musculus reads (n=53,287), and (4) in-flight runs 1-4 from bacterial reads identified using the SURPIrt pipeline. Assembly metrics, including N50, were calculated by the abyss-stats.pl program in ABySS (21). E. coli were mapped to the consensus PacBio genome using Mauve version 2.4.0 (22). Genome-wide pairwise identities of de novoassemblies were estimated using JSpeciesWS (23) after specifying the use of MUMmer (24) for pairwise identity calculations.\n\nPacBio data\nWe performed a de novo assembly of the E. coli genome used in this study using the PacBio data. We used the Hierarchical Genome Assembly Process (HGAP, v2) for read-cleaning and adapter trimming (pre-assembly), de novo assembly with Celera Assembler, and assembly polishing with Quiver (18). Raw sequencing reads were filtered for length and quality such that the minimum polymerase read score was 0.8, the minimum subread length was 500 bp, and the minimum polymerase read score was greater than 100. The assembly was generated using CeleraAssembler v1 with the default parameters and was polished using the Quiver algorithm (18). Our assembly yielded a single contig of 4,734,145 base pairs at >99.7% accuracy and confirmed the E. coli sample as strain K-12.\n\nIllumina data\nWe next performed independent de novo and directed assemblies of the E. coli genome using single-end Illumina data. Raw Illumina reads were preprocessed for trimming of adapters and removal of low-complexity and low-quality sequences. E. coli reads were identified using Bowtie2 alignment against the E. coli reference genome in local alignment mode at default parameters. De novo assembly was performed using the SPAdes genome assembly v3.8.2 (19) with the careful parameter.",

Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at room temperature and at 15,000 RPM to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to purify DNA following the manufacturer's protocol. DNA concentration and purity were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).     DNA sequencing library construction was performed by UC Davis Genome Center. Aliquots of each DNA sample were bisulfite-converted with the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold kit (Zymo Research). Sequencing libraries was generated from the converted DNA sample with the EpiGnome Methyl-Seq kit (Epicentre). The resulting libraries were QC-ed by bioanalyzer and quantified by fluorometric Qubic measurements and RT-PCR.     The BS-sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 3000 at UC Davis Genome Center. Each library was sequenced on one HiSeq lane by itself with paired end 100bp reads.     Merged fastq files were generated by concatenating the forward and reverse raw reads data for each sample into one forward and one reverse fastq file per sample. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and reports were combined with MultiQC (version 1.22.1).     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7113 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/DEV_Methyl-Seq/Methyl-Seq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7113_Versions/GL-DPPD-7113.md). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.8). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus Bismark references were built using Bismark (version 0.24.2) and Bowtie2 (version 2.5.4), with the Ensembl release 112, genome version GRCm39 reference (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus Bismark reference using Bismark (version 0.24.2) and Bowtie2 (version 2.5.4), the aligned data were sorted with samtools (version 1.21), and alignment quality was assessed with QualiMap (version 2.3). Bismark (version 0.24.2) was used to deduplicate the aligned (unsorted) data, then methylation calls were extracted from the deduplicated aligned data, and bismark reports were generated for each sample with Bismark (version 0.24.2). Bismark reports for each sample were combined into a bismark summary report with Bismark (version 0.24.2). Alignment qualiMap reports and Bismark reports were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). A runsheet containing sample group information was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and imported into R (version 4.4.2), and methylation call data was imported into R using methylkit (version 1.32.0). Pair-wise differential methylation analysis was performed in R at both the base and tile level using methylkit (version 1.32.0). Gene annotations were assigned to the differential methylation results using genomation (version 1.38.0) and custom annotation tables generated using UCSC gtfToGenePred (version 469) and UCSC genePredToBed (version 469) from the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf (Ensembl release 112).     Histology on samples was performed by Triangulum Biopharma LLC (San Diego, CA) on archived tissues available from NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA). In brief, for each sample, one half was embedded in paraffin, while the second half was embedded in Optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT) for cryosectioning. Paraffin embedded samples were sectioned at 4 um and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H and E). OCT-embedded samples were cryosectioned at 5 um and lipids stained with Oil Red O (ORO). Whole slide imaging was performed in bright field using a Pannoramic Scan from 3D Histech (a Perkin Elmer Company). Raw files were converted to .tiff and .jpg files using QuPath (https://qupath.github.io/). There are multiple sections per slide, one section from each animal. The order of animal IDs in the file names corresponds to the sections from top to bottom of each slide image.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a Molecular Cellular Imaging data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures/qualities). This enables all histology results to be identically structured for efficient data mining. In the transformation of the data sheet, Triangulum Task and Triangulum ID columns were removed as these are particular to the company who performed the histology. The remaining columns were left to allow efficient sorting by sample groups, dissection context, NASA ID, H and E File ID, and Oil Red O positivity staining percent.     For protein homogenization the urea based protein lysis buffer consisted of 8M urea, with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, at pH 8.5 in DNase- and RNase-free H2O and was custom ordered from Teknova, Hollister, CA. This recipe was initially provided by Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS). Protease inhibitors, 1:100 volumes of 0.1 M phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride solution in ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) and 1:100 volumes of complete EDTA-free tablets (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), was added to the lysis buffer kept on ice. A piece of liver weighing between 20-30 mg was cut from each liver sample and immediately added to 650 uL protein lysis buffer. Each sample was homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4 C and at 14,000 X g to remove cell debris. A 30 uL sample of each supernatant was kept on ice for total protein concentration assay, and the rest of the supernatant was snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen in aliquots. The Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to measure the total protein concentration of each protein sample.     Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility using the following SUMS protocol: 50 ug were drawn from each samples defrosted on ice (samples   1-9) and for the pool sample (sample   10). The remaining sample was immediately placed back in -80 C. 25 uL of 50mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0 was added to each sample, followed by 1.5 uL of 500mM DTT, incubated at 50 C for 30 minutes and cooled to room temperature. 3 uL of 1 M propionamide was added to each sample and incubated at room temperature for 1hr. 75 uL of 50mM ammonium bicarbonate, 0.02% protease max was added to each sample followed by 1.5 ug of trypsin/lysC (Promega) and overnight incubation at 37 C. 10 uL of 10% formic acid, 90% water was added to each sample to quench the digest. The samples were incubated at 37 C for 10 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 5 minutes. Microspin C18 columns (NEST group, p/n SEM SS18V) were equilibrated with acetonitrile followed by 2 times wash with 0.1% formic acid/water and each sample was cleaned and concentrated independently per vendor protocol. The eluant peptides were dried in a speed vac to less than 2 uL volume and stored at 4 C prior to TMT isobaric labeling. Each peptide pool was reconstituted in 100 uL, 100mM HEPES, pH 8.0. The TMT isobaric labels were reconstituted in 40 uL absolute ethyl alcohol and 20 uL of each isobaric tag as described above was added to the corresponding sample. The samples incubated at room temperature for 1.5hr, followed by the addition of 5 uL hydroxylamine to quench the reaction. 50 uL of each isobaric tagged peptide pool was drawn and pooled to a final volume of 500 uL, 500 uL of 0.1 % formic acid water was added to a final volume of 1 mL. This fraction (~250 ug total peptide) was purified on a Water Oasis HLB 3cc C18 cartridge per vendor protocol and the final eluant dried to completion in a speed vac. SCX offline fractionation was performed using a Protea SCX column (p/n SP-155) and the provided buffers. In brief, the previously dried 10plex peptide pool was dissolved in 150 uL reconstitution solution and loaded onto the equilibrated SCX column (3 times) followed by 2 sequential washes. The elution solution provided in the kit was diluted in series to 50 mM, 100 mM, 150 mM, 200 mM, 300 mM and 400 mM (stock) concentrations. The peptides were then eluted starting with the 50 mM salt concentration and collected in a new tube for the entire series. 200 uL of 0.1 % formic acid water was added to each SCX eluted fraction and each was microspin C18 purified as previously described.     Each fraction was reconstituted in 20 uL 0.2 % formic acid, 2 % acetonitrile, 97.8 % water and injected for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis.     RNA of RR-1 CASIS samples were purified and provided by Rodent Research project. RNA was extracted from homogenized tissues using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA concentration and purity were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was measured using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     RNA library construction was performed by UC Davis Genome Center using the Illumina TruSeq strandard RNA library prep kit after mRNA enrichment (poly-A specific). The libraries were QC-ed by bioanalyzer and quantified by fluorometric Qubit measurements.     The RNA library sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform, three high output HiSeq lanes with 50 bp single end reads and index reads. 30 miliion reads per sample was requested. Performed by UC Davis Genome Center.     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the GeneLab Reference Annotations pipeline (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0). Processing scripts used can be found on GitHub here: https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/RNAseq/GLDS_Processing_Scripts/GLDS-47/GLDS_version_11     A cohort of eight-month-old female C57BL/6Tac mice (Taconic Biosciences) were flown to the ISS, housed in the Rodent Habitat and were subjected to microgravity for 21 -22 days. Mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls (GC) housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. Additionally, a group of mice from the same cohort was used as basal control (BC) which were euthanized the day after launch as baseline references. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     The flight group mice were euthanized by ISS crew with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation and liver collection on Launch +21 and +22 days. Left hindlimb and spleen were collected prior to liver collection. Each whole liver sample was placed in an 1.8 ml cryovial and frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer. Ground and Basal controls were processed following the same protocol.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "A cohort of 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Lab) were flown to the ISS, housed in the Rodent Habitat and were subject to microgravity for 37 days. Mice of simiar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in the identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. Additionally, mice from the same cohort were used as basal control and vivarium control. Basal control mice were euthanized the day after launch as baseline references. Vivarium mice were housed in the standard vivarium cages for the same amount of time as spaceflight and ground control animals. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).     The flight group mice were euthanized by ISS crew with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation. Liver was collected after spleen upon euthanasia for mice M21 and M22, and was frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C). For the rest of the spaceflight mice, the carcasses were frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C) and brought back to Earth where disscetion was held. Ground control mice M31 and M32 followed the same protocol of on-orbit dissected animals (M21 and M22) and the livers were collected immediately followed by euthanasia. Rest of the ground control animals and all the basal and vivarium animals in this dataset have been dissected postflight per the protocol in the following.  Postflight dissection protocol: Mouse carcasses were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes. Multiple tissues, including liver, were collected from each carcass. Total dissection time for each carcass was no longer than 30 minutes since collection of the first tissue.  Liver was preserved in RLT buffer or protein lysis buffer, homogenized and snap frozen with liquid nitrogen.

RNA was extracted usign the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 volumes beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 30 mg of tissue was isolated using a scalpel and immediately placed in 800 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at room temperature at 15,000 RPM to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was eluted twice per sample in 30 uL H2O per elution. Concentration and absorbance ratios for all RNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     RNA sequencing library construction was performed by UC Davis Genome Center using the Illumina TruSeq strandard RNA library prep kit after mRNA enrichment (poly-A specific). The libraries were QC-ed by bioanalyzer and quantified by fluorometric Qubit measurements.     The RNA library sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform, three high output HiSeq lanes with 50 bp single end reads and index reads. 30 million reads per sample was requested. Performed by UC Davis Genome Center.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0). Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8) and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 96, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the GeneLab Reference Annotations pipeline (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).

This recipe was initially provided by Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS). Protease inhibitors, 1:100 volumes of 0.1 M phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride solution in ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) and 1:100 volumes of cOmplete EDTA-free tablets (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), were added to the lysis buffer kept on ice. A piece of liver weighing between 20-30 mg was cut from each liver sample and immediately added to 650 uL protein lysis buffer. Each sample was homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4 C and at 14,000 X g to remove cell debris. A 30 uL sample of each supernatant was kept on ice for total protein concentration assay, and the rest of the supernatant was snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen in aliquots. The Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to measure the total protein concentration of each protein sample.     Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility in two batches, the first batch included spaceflight and ground control samples and the second batch included basal and vivarium control samples. In the first batch, the samples were divided into two TMT 10-plex labeling groups. Group B consisted of ground control (GC) samples 21, 22, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, a pool of all NASA GC samples, a pool of all NASA and CASIS (GLDS-47) GC samples, and a pool of all CASIS (GLDS-47) basal (BA) samples. Group C consisted of spaceflight (FLT) samples 2, 3, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, a pool of all NASA FLT samples, a pool of all NASA and CASIS (GLDS-47) FLT samples, and a pool of all CASIS (GLDS-47) basal (BA) samples. This labeling scheme enables comparison across NASA and CASIS specimen groups in the RR-1 study. CASIS FLT and GC samples were labeled separately as TMT 10-plex Group A (GLDS-47). In the second batch, the ten basal and vivarium control samples were processed in one TMT 11-plex labeling group along with one pool of all samples. TMT Isobaric label reagent lot number RE231321 (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/90110) SUMS protocol was followed: 50 ug were drawn from each samples defrosted on ice. The remaining sample was immediately placed back in -80C. 25uL of 50mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0 was added to each sample, followed by 1.5 uL of 500mM DTT, incubated at 50C for 30 minutes and cooled to room temperature. 3 uL of 1M propionamide was added to each sample and incubated at room temperature for 1hr. 75 uL of 50mM ammonium bicarbonate, 0.02% protease max was added to each sample followed by 1.5 ug of trypsin/lysC (Promega) and overnight incubation at 37C. 10 uL of 10% formic acid, 90% water was added to each sample to quench the digest. The samples were incubated at 37C for 10 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 10,000g for 5 minutes. Microspin C18 columns (NEST group, p/n SEM SS18V) were equilibrated with acetonitrile followed by 2 times wash with 0.1% formic acid/water and each sample was cleaned and concentrated independently per vendor protocol. The eluant peptides were dried in a speed vac to less than 2 uL volume and stored at 4C prior to TMT isobaric labeling. Each peptide pool was reconstituted in 100 uL, 100mM HEPES, pH 8.0. The TMT isobaric labels were reconstituted in 40 uL absolute ethyl alcohol and 20 uL of each isobaric tag as described above was added to the corresponding sample. The samples incubated at room temperature for 1.5hr, followed by the addition of 5 uL hydroxylamine to quench the reaction. 50 uL of each isobaric-tagged peptide pool was drawn and pooled to a final volume of 500 uL, 500 uL of 0.1% formic acid water was added to a final volume of 1mL. This fraction (~250 ug total peptide) was purified on a Water Oasis HLB 3cc C18 cartridge per vendor protocol and the final eluent dried to completion in a speed vac. SCX offline fractionation was performed using a Protea SCX column (p/n SP-155) and the provided buffers. In brief, the previously dried 10plex peptide pool was dissolved in 150 uL reconstitution solution and loaded onto the equilibrated SCX column (3 times) followed by 2 sequential washes. The elution solution provided in the kit was diluted in series to 50mM, 100mM, 150mM, 200mM, 300mM and 400mM (stock) concentrations. The peptides were then eluted starting with the 50mM salt concentration and collected in a new tube for the entire series. 200 uL of 0.1% formic acid water was added to each SCX eluted fraction and each was Microspin C18 purified as previously described. Each fraction was reconstituted in 20 uL 0.2% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile, 97.8% water and injected for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis.     Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility using the Thermo Orbitrap Fusion MS.     Proteome Discoverer/ Byonic Peptide Database: Uniprot mus musculus with isoforms. Raw files were converted into a .mzML file format using ProteoWizard 3.0.10875.     Histology on samples was performed by Triangulum Biopharma LLC (San Diego, CA) on archived tissues available from NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA). In brief, for each sample, one half was embedded in paraffin, while the second half was embedded in Optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT) for cryosectioning. Paraffin embedded samples were sectioned at 4 um and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H and E). OCT-embedded samples were cryosectioned at 5 um and lipids stained with Oil Red O (ORO). Whole slide imaging was performed in bright field using a Pannoramic Scan from 3D Histech (a Perkin Elmer Company). Raw files were converted to .tiff and .jpg files using QuPath (https://qupath.github.io/). There are multiple sections per slide, one section from each animal. The order of animal IDs in the file names corresponds to the sections from top to bottom of each slide image.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a Molecular Cellular Imaging data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures/qualities). This enables all histology results to be identically structured for efficient data mining. In the transformation of the data sheet, Triangulum Task and Triangulum ID columns were removed as these are particular to the company who performed the histology. The remaining columns were left to allow efficient sorting by sample groups, dissection context, NASA ID, H and E File ID, and Oil Red O positivity staining percent.     DNA was extracted usign the AllPrep DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, homogenization buffer for DNA purification was made by adding 1:100 volumes beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 30 mg of tissue was isolated using a scalpel and immediately placed in 800 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at room temperature at 15,000 RPM to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA following the manufacturer's protocol. Concentration and absorbance ratios for all DNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).     DNA sequencing library construction was performed by UC Davis Genome Center. Aliquots of each DNA sample was bisulfite-converted with the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold kit (Zymo Research). Sequencing libraries was generated from the converted DNA sample with the EpiGnome Methyl-Seq kit (Epicentre). The resulting libraries were QC-ed by bioanalyzer and quantified by fluorometric Qubic measurements and RT-PCR.     The BS-sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 3000 at UC Davis Genome Center. Each library was sequenced on one HiSeq lane by itself with paired end 100bp reads.     Merged fastq files were generated by concatenating the forward and reverse raw reads data for each sample into one forward and one reverse fastq file per sample. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and reports were combined with MultiQC (version 1.26).     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7113 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/DEV_Methyl-Seq/Methyl-Seq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7113_Versions/GL-DPPD-7113.md). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.8). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus Bismark references were built using Bismark (version 0.24.2) and Bowtie2 (version 2.5.4), with the Ensembl release 112, genome version GRCm39 reference (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus Bismark reference using Bismark (version 0.24.2) and Bowtie2 (version 2.5.4), the aligned data were sorted with samtools (version 1.21), and alignment quality was assessed with QualiMap (version 2.3). Bismark (version 0.24.2) was used to deduplicate the aligned (unsorted) data, then methylation calls were extracted from the deduplicated aligned data, and bismark reports were generated for each sample with Bismark (version 0.24.2). Bismark reports for each sample were combined into a bismark summary report with Bismark (version 0.24.2). Alignment qualiMap reports and Bismark reports were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). A runsheet containing sample group information was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and imported into R (version 4.4.2), and methylation call data was imported into R using methylkit (version 1.32.0). Pair-wise differential methylation analysis was performed in R at both the base and tile level using methylkit (version 1.32.0). Gene annotations were assigned to the differential methylation results using genomation (version 1.38.0) and custom annotation tables generated using UCSC gtfToGenePred (version 469) and UCSC genePredToBed (version 469) from the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf (Ensembl release 112).     RNA was extracted usign the AllPrep RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 volumes beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 30 mg of tissue was isolated using a scalpel and immediately placed in 800 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at room temperature at 15,000 RPM to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify  RNA following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was eluted twice per sample in 30 uL H2O per elution. Concentration and absorbance ratios for all RNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     RNA methylation analysis was performed by Epigentek. Sixty samples of Total mouse liver RNA was prepared by GeneLab and received by Epigentek. The samples were subjected to bisulfite conversion, cDNA reverse transcription, library preparation, Bioanalyzer QC, KAPA library quantification, multiplex NGS on an Illumina HiSeq2500 and advanced data analysis. Bisulfite Conversion: RNA samples were bisulfite treated with the Methylamp RNA Bisulfite Conversion Kit (Epigentek Cat.   P-9003). 200 ng for the samples N1, N2, N4 through N12, and N37 through N60. 100 ng for the samples N3 and N13 through N36. Library Preparation: -cDNA was synthesized from bisulfite treated RNA and ligated with adaptors by using random probing method. -Library amplification was performed using indexed primers and library cDNA was purified with magnetic beads -Purified library cDNA was eluted in 12 uL of water. Library QC: Library construction was verified on a Bioanalyzer and KAPA Library Quantification.     The BS-sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 3000 at UC Davis Genome Center. Each library was sequenced on one HiSeq lane by itself with paired end 100bp reads.",

We propose to use NASA GeneLab database to gain new knowledge on potential systemic responses to space. Unbiased systems biology analysis of transcriptomic data from seven different rodent datasets reveals for the first time the existence of potential 'master regulators' coordinating a systemic response to microgravity and/or space radiation with TGF-β1 being the most common regulator. We hypothesized the space environment leads to the release of biomolecules circulating inside the blood stream. Through datamining we identified 13 candidate microRNAs (miRNA) which are common in all studies and directly interact with TGF-β1 that can be potential circulating factors impacting space biology. This study exemplifies the utility of the GeneLab data repository to aid in the process of performing novel hypothesis-based research.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Data collected from placebo mice flown on STS-135 as part of the CBTM-3 payload sponsored by Amgen and BioServe Space Technologies. On July 8, 2011, age- and weight-matched female C57BL/6CR mice (n equals 15/group) were placed into three Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs, 2 groups of 5 per AEM separated by a wire mesh) and flown on the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) for 13 days. There were two sets of ground controls housed at the Space Life Science Laboratory (SLSL) at KSC. Due to the nature of the NASA BSP program, we did not receive tissues from all mice for all assays.Ground AEM control mice were placed into the same hardware used in flight and environmental parameters such as temperature and CO2 levels were matched as closely as possible based on 48-hour delayed telemetry data. Conditions were controlled for temperature, humidity, and a 12:12 hr light:dark cycle; food (food bars developed by NASA Ames) and water was provided ad libitum. Vivarium control mice were housed in standard shoebox cages and fed standard rodent chow. Vivarium mice were used to normalize cell counts, minimizing day-to-day variability.     Mice were euthanized and dissected within 3-5 hours of landing. As part of the primary science, all mice underwent dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) densitometry (Piximus, Inc., Fitchburg, WI) immediately prior to anesthesia and euthanization. Mice were anesthetized with 3-5% isoflurane and euthanized with 100% CO2 and exsanguination. These studies were approved by the NASA Ames and University of Colorado at Boulder Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs).\n\nTissue Handling: Tissues were harvested, weighed, and processed at the KSC. Each spleen was cut in half, placed into complete Roswell Park Memorial Institute-1640 (RPMI-1640) medium with 20% bovine calf serum and shipped on ice via overnight courier to LLU for further processing. Both adrenal and liver tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen at the time of dissection and stored at -80C until analysis.     The absorbed dose from ionizing radiation received by the flight specimens was estimated using TLD passive dosimeters located in the middeck of the space shuttle, where the payload was located. More specifically, we computed the average between three dosimeters (DLOC1, DLOC2, and DLOC3) for the mission and we divided it by the total duration of the mission to estimate the average absorbed dose rate in mGy/day. This dose rate did not include any shielding effects from the hardware where the specimens resided. The total absorbed dose in water was then computed by simply multiplying the average dose rate with the duration of the experiment. The duration of the experiment was defined as the time in space during which the specimen was 'living'. Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. A table with these detailed computations for all space shuttle datasets is available on GeneLab at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation. The ground samples were not assessed for radiation exposure.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.5 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.5/Microarray/Affymetrix/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAffymetrix). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.4). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using oligo (version 1.58.0). Raw data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). The raw probe level intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the oligo (version 1.58.0) quantile method. Normalized probe level data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). Normalized probe level data was summarized to the probeset level using the oligo (version 1.58.0) RMA method. Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probeset using biomaRt (version 2.50.0), Ensembl database (ensembl.org, release 107). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probeset to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned for every probeset that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).     RNA isolation was performed using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc. Valencia, CA) as per the manufacturer's instructions. A maximum of 30-mg frozen liver/mouse tissue was used.\n\nTarget Preparation/Processing for GeneChip Analysis: After isolation, RNA was frozen at -80C and shipped on dry ice to the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Genomics High-Throughput Facility (GHTF) for further analysis. The following protocol was provided by the UCI GHTF. Isolated total RNA samples were processed as recommended by Affymetrix, Inc. (Affymetrix GeneChip Whole Transcript Sense Target Labeling Assay Manual, Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). In brief, total RNA was initially isolated as described above and then put through an RNeasy spin column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) for further clean up. Eluted total RNAs were quantified by NanoDrop (ThermoScientific, Wilmington, DE) and the concentrations of sample aliquots were adjusted to 100 ng/ul. Total RNA samples were assessed for quality prior to performing target preparation/processing steps by loading approximately 25-250 ng of each sample onto a RNA 6000 Nano LabChip, which was evaluated on an Agilent Biolanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA).     The Ambion whole transcript (WT) expression kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) was used to prepare RNA samples for whole transcriptome microarray analysis. Briefly, random hexamers that were tagged with a T7 promoter were used in first strand synthesis of cDNA. Then, using the T7 promoter, second strand synthesis was performed and the double-stranded cDNA was subsequently used as a template in an in vitro transcription reaction to generate many copies of antisense cRNA. 10 ug of antisense cRNA was input into a second cycle cDNA reaction using reverse transcriptase and random hexamers to produce single- stranded DNA in the sense orientation. The single-stranded DNA was fragmented to an average length of 70 bases and then labeled using a recombinant terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and an Affymetrix proprietary DNA labeling reagent that was covalently linked to biotin.     Two ug of the labeled, fragmented single-stranded cDNA was hybridized at 45C with rotation for 17 hours (Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640) to probe sets present on an Affymetrix GeneChip 1.0ST array. The GeneChip arrays were washed and then stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin on an Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 (Fluidics protocol FS450_007).     Arrays were scanned using GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G and Command Console Software v. 3.2.3 to produce .CEL intensity files.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "RNA was prepared from individual S and G skin samples from the head and tail regions using RiboPure kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All RNA samples had a RNA quality indicator 7.6 as assessed by capillary electrophoresis (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).     biotin labeling     Complementary DNA was hybridized to Genechip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at the Genomic Platform of the GIGA (University of Liege, Belgium). Only transcripts having a signal level above 100U in at least one sample were considered as expressed.     measurement of labeling intensity by LASER scanning     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.5 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.5/Microarray/Affymetrix/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAffymetrix). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.4). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using oligo (version 1.58.0). Raw data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). The raw probe level intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the oligo (version 1.58.0) quantile method. Normalized probe level data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). Normalized probe level data was summarized to the probeset level using the oligo (version 1.58.0) RMA method. Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probeset using biomaRt (version 2.50.0), Ensembl database (ensembl.org, release 107). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probeset to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned for every probeset that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).     Six male C57Bl/J10 mice were housed for 91 days in the specially designed Mouse Drawer System in weightlessness aboard the International Space Station. Three wild-type mice (WT) and three  transgenic mice overexpressing the osteogneic factor PTN/OSF1 under the control of the human bone specific ostecalcin promoter (Tg) were used in the experiment. During the 3-month stay on the ISS, 3 mice unfortunately died leaving 2 Tg and 1 WT.\nThree WT and three Tg mice were individually housed in the Mouse Drawer System (MDS) (space group (S)) that was integrated in the middeck of the shuttle Discovery, flight STS-128, to reach the ISS on 28 August 2009 and transferred to the Express Rack 4 in the Japanese Experiment Model onboard of ISS until return to Earth by the shuttle Atlantis (STS-129) on 27 November 2009.\nOn total, mice spent 91 days in weightlessness which is the longest duration animal experimentation in space. Mice were provided with water ad libitum and 5g of dry food per day. Less than 3h after landing on Earth, the three remaining living mice were transported to the Life Support Facility at KSC where body weighing and collection of urine and blood were performed before sacrifice by carbon dioxide inhalation followed by dissection, collection, and processing of the different tissues and organs.\nA ground control experiment (ground group (G)) replicating food and water supplementation and environmental conditions was conducted in a MDS from 13 November 2009 to 11 February 2010 in the animal facility of the Advanced Biotechnology Center at the University of Genova. One Tg and two WT mice were sacrificed on the same experimental day as the corresponding space mouse death and placed at -20C.     After roughly shaving hair, skin specimens of ~1.5cm2 were collected in the head and tail regions on either dorso-lateral side of the body (four skin samples per mouse) and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen before storage at -80C and transportation in dry ice to our laboratory in Liege (Belgium). A transverse fragment in the middle of the body was fixed in formalin for 2h, transferred to 70% ethanol, transported at room temperature, and stored at 8C until processing for histological analysis.",

During the 3-month stay on the ISS, 3 mice unfortunately died leaving 2 Tg and 1 WT. MDS tissue sharing program allowed several teams to study various tissues from these mice. Our aim was to investigate the effect of such a long period of microgravity on skin physiology by morphological, biochemical and genomewide analyses by comparison to similar mice on ground. Gene expression in the skin of 3 space mice and of 3 ground mice was analyzed by microarray. As this unique experiment performed on 3 mice limits the power of statistical analyis, as the transgene PTN/OSF1 was not overexpressed in skin and as a pair wise Pearson's correlation rates between the individual levels of expressed transcripts in the WT and the Tg mice were not significantly different from each other in one experimental group (space or ground), data from the 3 mice were combined to compare results from the space an ground groups.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Male wild type C57BL/10J mice (8 weeks old at the beginning of experiment) were utilized (n equals 3). They were individually housed in mouse drawer system (MDS, 11.6 x 9.8 x 8.4 cm), which is a payload developed by Alenia-Space. Food and water were supplied ad libitum. These mice were launched by Space Shuttle Discovery (space transport system, STS-128) at August 28, 2009. They were housed in Japanese Experimental Module (Kibou) on the ISS until they returned to the Earth by Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-129) on November 27, 2009. Only one mouse returned to the Earth alive. Whole brain was sampled from the mouse killed by inhalation of carbon dioxide at the Life Sciences Support Facility of Kennedy Space Center within 3-4 hours after landing. After the spaceflight experiment, the on-ground experiment was also carried out at the Advanced Biotechnology Center in Genova, Italy. A mouse with the same species, sex, and age was housed in MDS for 3 months as the ground control (GC). Another mouse was housed in normal vivarium cage as the laboratory control (LC). Amount of food and water supplementation and environmental conditions were simulated as the flight group. After 3 months, brain was sampled from one mouse in group GC and LC, respectively.     Approximately 100mg of brain tissue from each of the snap-frozen mouse whole brain samples were collected, and total RNA was extracted by RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol provided in the kit (QIAGEN, cat#74903).     1 ug of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using T7-oligo-dT primer and produced cDNA was double-stranded by Amino Allyl MessageAmp II aRNA Amplification Kit (Ambion, cat#AM1753). From ds-cDNA, aRNA was amplified and labeled with amino allyl UTP, and then Cy5-coupling to amino allyl modified aRNA was carried out according to the instruction of the Amino Allyl MessageAmp II aRNA Amplification Kit.     5 ug of the purified Cy5-aRNA sample was dissolved in 100 ul of hybridization solution (CombiMatrix CustomArray 12K Hybridization and Imaging Protocol: PTL006), and hybridization reaction was carried out at 45 C for 16hours. 70 Negative control probes (derived from bacteria, plants, and bacteriophages) were spotted, and 326 factory QC probes were also spotted on the microarray. In addition, there were 148 empty (blank) spots available for background signal measurement.  Therefore, signal data from total of 544 control spots were included in 12,544-spot data on the custom-designed Mus musculus 12K oligo DNA microarray.     The raw data (Mm_B-GC_RawData_for_GEO.txt, Mm_B-LC_RawData_for_GEO.txt, and Mm_B-SF_RawData_for_GEO.txt) were obtained from the scanned images using MicroarrayImager ver.6.0.1 (CombiMatrix Corp.), and were background-subtracted and median-normalized by Microsoft Office Excel 2003 within each of the microarray. We employed simple fold-difference calculation using Microsoft Office Excel 2003 for each of the spot intensities between GC:LC, GC:SF, and LC:SF. Since sample number (n) was 1 for all of the condition groups, there was no application of statistical analysis for this data processing.     The microarrays went through post-hybridization washes according to CombiMatrix CustomArray 12K Hybridization and Imaging Protocol (PTL006), and they were scaned by Axon Instruments' GenePix 4000B scanner (5 um resolution, PMT gain at 500, Laser power at 100%).     ID_REF equals VALUE equals Background-subtracted and median-normalized signal intensity",

The expression levels of 60 genes significantly changed in response to SF compared with LC and/or GC. The 15 and 16 genes were up- (greater than 2 folds) and down-regulated (less than 0.5 folds), respectively, following SF vs. GC. The levels of 58 genes were significantly altered by housing in MDS in space and/or on the ground. Forty seven and 11 genes were significantly up- and down-regulated vs. LC. Twenty seven out of these genes responded to caging in MDS both in space and on the ground. Further, 31 genes were influenced by housing in MDS on the Earth. Responses of the characteristics of brain to long-term gravitational unloading were investigated in mice.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy MinElute columns (Qiagen,Valencia, CA). RNA concentration and purity were determined from measuring absorbance at 260 and 280 nm; 2 ug total RNA was run on a 1% denaturing gel and 100 ng were loaded on the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) to verify RNA integrity.     Briefly, accordingly to the recommendations of the manufacturer, 100 ng total RNA was used in the first-round synthesis of double-stranded cDNA. The RNA was reverse transcribed using a WT cDNA synthesis and amplification kit (Affymetrix). The resulting biotin-labeled cRNA was purified using an IVT clean-up kit (Affymetrix) and quantified using a UV spectrophotometer (A260/280; Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). An aliquot (15 ug) of cRNA was fragmented by heat and ion-mediated hydrolysis at 94C for 35 minutes.     Fragmented cRNA, run on the Bioanalyzer to verify the correct electropherogram, was hybridized in a hybridization oven (16 hours, 45C) to a Mouse Gene 1.0 ST array (Affymetrix) representing whole-transcript coverage. The washing and staining of the arrays with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was completed in Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix).     The arrays were subsequently scanned using a confocal laser GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G and GeneChip Command Console (Affymetrix).

Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probeset using biomaRt (version 2.50.0), Ensembl database (ensembl.org, release 107). Gene annotations were assigned for every probeset that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).     C57BL/J6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Calco, LC, Italy). Mice were bred and maintained at the animal facility of the Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro (Genova, Italy). The care and use of animals were in compliance with laws of the Italian Ministry of Health and the guidelines of the European Community. Six- to 8-week-old mice were sacrificed, by CO2 asphyxiation, and bone marrow cells were collected by flushing nucleate cells out of the femurs and tibiae with cold PBS. Cells were cultured (2 × 10^6 nucleated cells/10-cm Petri dish) in a growth medium [Coon's modified Ham's F12 medium (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (GIBCO, Italy), 1% glutamine, 1% penicillin–streptomycin]. No cytokines were added at any stage. Cultures were incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. After 3 days, non-adherent cells were removed. When 80% confluent, the adherent cells were trypsinized (0.05% trypsin/EDTA at 37°C for 10 min) and expanded (P1 stage).     Ten days before the Soyuz launch, 2 × 10^5 BMSC were transferred by capillarity onto a porous bioceramic Skelite disks (Φ 9 mm × T 1.2 mm, Millenium Biologix, Ontario, Canada) and incubated in normal growth medium, that is, alpha-modified minimum essential medium Eagle (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, UK). Seven days before launch, the cells/Skelite constructs were transported to the launch site at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan inside a Thermocase B5 (COMAT SA, Flourens, France) at 37°C. Five days before launch, half of the disks were transferred to osteogenic medium, that is, normal growth medium supplemented with 50 µg/ml ascorbic acid, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate and 10−8 M dexamethasone (Sigma, Italy). Two days before launch, disks were integrated individually into bioreactors, then into the KUBIK payload. Following launch, disks were exposed to microgravity for 200 h with three times of medium refreshment at an interval of 50–51 h, then conserved in RNAlater (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) by two consecutive flushing at an interval of 10 min. All bioreactors were stored at 12°C till landing. Two days post-landing they were brought to the laboratory for disassembling to extract disks for further processing. The GC disks were treated in the same manner as the flight disks (FE and FC). The LC disks were processed immediately after the addition of RNAlater solution.",

          "Study Description": "In March 2006, murine Bone Marrow Stromal Cells (BMSC) were flown in the Soyuz 12S to the International Space Station to investigate the effects of microgravity on their osteogenic potential in a three-dimensional environment. BMSC were grown in porous bioceramic Skelite disks (dia 9 mm x T 1.2 mm). The constructs were exposed to microgravity for ca. 8 days, then fixed for RNA extraction. While the flight experiment was performed in fully automated hardware inside the KUBIK incubator, one group of control samples were incubated inside manually operated hardwares (flight control), and the other control group was incubated under routine laboratory conditions (lab control). The altered gene expression profile was analyzed by Mouse Gene 1.0 ST array (Affymetrix) representing whole-transcript coverage. Each one of the 28853 genes is represented on the array by approximately 26 probes spread across the full length of the gene, providing a more complete and more accurate picture of gene expression than the 3' based expression array design. A few days of microgravity were sufficient to determinate, at least at the molecular level, an effect in the BMSC; this response expressed a stress condition able to determinate consequences on several compartments and cellular functions. In particular, it seems to promote a gene expression, known to be associated with neurogenic activity (e.g. axon guidance), perhaps promoting the BMSC capability to be committed in that direction. The osteo-induction, by dexamethasone-based medium, due to the short duration of stimulation, did not have the possibility to manifest itself at the phenotypic level but only partially at the molecular level.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Total RNA from thymus tissue was isolated using Qiagen Rneasy© reagents and protocols, including the tissue disruption and homogenization involving the use of a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen (LN2) and spinning with Qiagen QIAshredder© tubes. Quality and purity of RNA preparations were assessed by electrophoresis and via spectrophotometric determination of the ratio of absorbance at 260/280 nm using the ND-1000 spectrophometer (NanoDrop Tech.).     Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).     Standard manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix).     Arrays were set to standard manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix).     Arrays were normalized using RMA (Robust Multichip Average methodology) from the Oligo library from BioConductor. Analysis of variance was used to determine the statistical significance of the expression level changes between space and control conditions, using the affy and limma Bioconductor libraries.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.1 (GitHub link coming soon).  In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.2). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using oligo (version 1.58.0). Raw data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). The raw probe level intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the oligo (version 1.58.0) quantile method. Normalized probe level data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0).  Normalized probe level data was summarized to the probeset level using the oligo (version 1.58.0) RMA method. Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probeset using biomaRt (version 2.50.0), Ensembl database (ensembl.org, release 107). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probeset to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned for every probeset that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).     C57BL/6NTac female mice (n  equals 36; Taconic Farms, Inc., Germantown, NY) were shipped directly to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Space Life Sciences Laboratory (SLSL) at Kennedy Space Center at approximately 7 weeks of age. Animal enclosure modules (AEM) with food bars and water were used to house flight mice (FLT, n  equals12) and ground controls (AEM, n  equals 12). Mice at 8 weeks of age were acclimated to the enclosures for a period of 1 week prior to spaceflight.     The FLT mice were flown on board the Space Shuttle Endeavour (STS-118) for 13 days. Average FLT temperature for 13 days aboard the shuttle was 81.5°F (±0.47) and the average AEM ground control temperature was 82.4°F (±0.12).     The absorbed dose from ionizing radiation received by the flight specimens was estimated using TLD passive dosimeters located in the middeck of the space shuttle, where the payload was located. More specifically, we computed the average between three dosimeters (DLOC1, DLOC2, and DLOC3) for the mission and we divided it by the total duration of the mission to estimate the average absorbed dose rate in mGy/day. This dose rate did not include any shielding effects from the hardware where the specimens resided. The total absorbed dose in water was then computed by simply multiplying the average dose rate with the duration of the experiment. The duration of the experiment was defined as the time in space during which the specimen was 'living'. Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. A table with these detailed computations for all space shuttle datasets is available on GeneLab at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation. The ground samples were not assessed for radiation exposure.     Mice were euthanized with 100% CO2 within 3–5 h after landing. Organs, including spleen and thymus, were prepared at the SLSL and shipped frozen on dry ice to Loma Linda University (LLU) where a portion of the thymus lobes were then shipped frozen at −80°C to our lab at The University of Arizona.",

We used microarrays to detail the gene expression of space-flown thymic tissue and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process. We report here microarray gene expression analysis in young adult C57BL/6NTac mice at 8 weeks of age after exposure to spaceflight aboard the space shuttle (STS-118) for a period of 13 days. Upon conclusion of the mission, thymus lobes were extracted from space flown mice (FLT) as well as age- and sex-matched ground control mice similarly housed in animal enclosure modules (AEM). mRNA was extracted and an automated array analysis for gene expression was performed. Examination of the microarray data revealed 970 individual probes that had a 1.5 fold or greater change. When these data were averaged (n equals 4), we identified 12 genes that were significantly up- or down-regulated by at least 1.5 fold after spaceflight (p less than 0.05). Together, these data demonstrate that spaceflight induces significant changes in the thymic mRNA expression of genes that regulate stress, glucocorticoid receptor metabolism, and T cell signaling activity. These data explain, in part, the reported systemic compromise of the immune system after exposure to the microgravity of space.",

All animal procedures were approved by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Time-bred female Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) were assigned to either pregnant or lactating groups. For spaceflight studies female rats (n equals 4) were flown aboard the Shuttle Discovery, STS-70, beginning on pregnancy day 11 [flight (FLT)], within 1 h after shuttle landing on pregnancy day 20 (P20) mammary tissue was collected and submerged in liquid nitrogen. A FLT control group (n equals 4) was time-delayed 48 h [flight delayed synchronized (FDS)] to mimic conditions of the flight group. For HG studies rat dams on pregnancy day nine (P9) were assigned to either 2-G HG or 1-G control conditions. Other than 2-G exposure on a centrifuge from P9 to P20 or lactation day 1 (L1), HG and control animals were exposed to identical environmental conditions (light, sound, temperature, and humidity) as previously described. Animals were euthanized at the same time of day on P20 and L1 to account for diurnal variations. For the L1 group, real-time videography was used to identify the precise time of birth for each dam, and dams were retrieved within 18 to 36 h following birth.

          "Study Protocol Description": "Total RNA was prepared from tissue samples by Trizol extraction followed by purification using RNeasy columns (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Quality and purity of the RNA preparations were assessed by spectrophotometric determination of A260:A280 ratios and by quantification of 28S:18S ribosomal RNA ratios using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA).     Synthesis of double stranded cDNA, in vitro transcription of biotin-labeled cRNA targets and fragmentation of target cRNA were performed as outlined by Affymetrix protocols.     Fragmented cRNA samples were hybridized overnight at 45C in a GeneChip hybridization oven 640. Post hybridization washing and phycoerythrin-streptavidin staining were performed in an Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 using established Affymetrix protocols.     GeneChips were scanned with an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000, two passes     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.5 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.5/Microarray/Affymetrix/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAffymetrix). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.4). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using oligo (version 1.58.0). Raw data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). The raw probe level intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the oligo (version 1.58.0) quantile method. Normalized probe level data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). Normalized probe level data was summarized to the probeset level using the oligo (version 1.58.0) RMA method. Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probeset using biomaRt (version 2.50.0), Ensembl database (ensembl.org, release 107). Gene annotations were assigned for every probeset that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).     SF animals were flown on the middeck of the space shuttle Endeavour (STS-108/UF-1) for 11 days and 19 h beginning December 5, 2001. AEM animals were housed at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Hangar L orbital environmental simulator for 11 days and 19 h with conditions mimicking the shuttle's middeck temperature, humidity, and CO2 levels.\n\nFor the ground-based unloading/reloading studies, mice were divided into three groups (n = 5/group): control, suspension, and suspension plus reloading. The suspension animals were killed while suspended at the end of the 12 days. Suspended mice were unsuspended for 3.5 h at the end of the 12 days of suspension and allowed to engage in normal loading for this period to match the time between landing and death for the STS-108 mice.\n\nAnimals were maintained on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle with all animal care, treatment, and housing density within National Institutes of Health guidelines.     All animals were 77 days of age at the time of death. Tissues were dissected and then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.     The absorbed dose from ionizing radiation received by the flight specimens was estimated using TLD passive dosimeters located in the middeck of the space shuttle, where the payload was located. More specifically, we computed the average between three dosimeters (DLOC1, DLOC2, and DLOC3) for the mission and we divided it by the total duration of the mission to estimate the average absorbed dose rate in mGy/day. This dose rate did not include any shielding effects from the hardware where the specimens resided. The total absorbed dose in water was then computed by simply multiplying the average dose rate with the duration of the experiment. The duration of the experiment was defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”. Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. A table with these detailed computations for all space shuttle datasets is available on GeneLab at https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/environmental/radiation.  The ground samples were not assessed for radiation exposure.",

          "Study Description": "Spaceflight results in a number of adaptations to skeletal muscle, including atrophy and shifts towards faster muscle fiber types. To identify changes in gene expression that may underlie these adaptations, microarray expression analysis was performed on gastrocnemius from mice flown on the STS-108 shuttle flight (11 days, 19 hours) versus mice maintained on earth for the same period. Additionally, to identify changes that were due to unloading and reloading, microarray analyses were conducted on calf muscle from ground-based mice subjected to hindlimb suspension (12 days) and mice subjected to hindlimb suspension plus a brief period of reloading (3.5 hours) to simulate the time between landing and sacrifice of the spaceflight mice.",
