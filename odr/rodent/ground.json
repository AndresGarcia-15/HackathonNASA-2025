          "Study Protocol Description": "WAG male rats (n equals 69), a substrain of WAG/Rij, separated from the colony at Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO, Rijswijk, Netherlands), in about 1975, and maintained at Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), were shipped to the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Upton, NY. The hindlimb unloading )HU) procedure was initiated 5 days prior to sham-irradiation or irradiation as described below. On Day 1, the rats were randomly grouped to serve as either full weight-bearing on all four limbs, or to be HU via tail suspension with body weight borne on the two front limbs. The HU procedure was a modified version of the one previously published (Wiley et al., 2016). Briefly, rats were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane (2.5–3.0%; 100% oxygen flow rate). While anesthetized, the tail was cleaned using 70% isopropyl alcohol. Benzoin tincture was applied to the lateral surfaces of the tail prior to the placement of strips (1 cm wide by 30 cm long) of adhesive medical traction tape (3M, St. Paul, MN, United States). The tape was placed approximately 1 cm from base of the tail, spanning distally for approximately the next 3/4ths the length of the tail. The free end of the tape was looped through a catch that was part of a custom-build plastic ball bearing swivel. After passing through the swivel, the tape was symmetrically adhered to the other lateral side of the tail in a similar spatial manner. Three pieces of 1/2-in micropore surgical tape (3M, St. Paul, MN, United States) were secured perpendicularly along the traction tape. A 1.56-in stainless oval wire carabiner clip (Nite Ize, Boulder, CO, United States) was attached through a hole on the top portion of the plastic swivel, with the other end of the carabiner clip attached to a zipper hook that slides along a perlon cord (STAS group, BA, Eindhoven, Netherlands). The cord was attached to a clothesline support separator spreader pulley (Blue Hawk, Gilbert, AZ, United States) that slides along a 5/16-in diameter round, solid steel rod (Hillman, Cincinnati, OH, United States). Once the attachment was complete, the zipper lock was adjusted along the perlon cord to lift the hind limbs fully off the substrate with a pitch angle of the thorax and abdomen 30\u000edegree relative to the horizontal substrate plane. Rats quickly recovered from anesthesia and were monitored closely for the next 24 h. Rats maintained under standard gravitational conditions (non-HU) received isoflurane, but were not tail suspended. All HU and non-HU rats were further subgrouped as to receive one of the two radiation doses (0.75 Gy or 1.5 Gy) or sham-irradiation (0 Gy), and all animals were singly housed. Monitoring over the next 5 days was carefully performed to ensure the HU rats had access to food and water and could move smoothly across the cage, despite the hind limbs not touching the substrate. Wet rodent chow and gel packs were provided to ensure hydration. Corrugated cardboard bedding was supplied to permit burrowing for all rats. On Day 5, animals were transferred from HU or non-HU housing to a new plexiglass box (holder) drilled with air holes for radiation or sham-radiation exposure. HU animals remained suspended through the transferring process by removing the plastic ball bearing from the carabiner and relocating the animal to a plastic plexiglass holder (9.5' x 4' x 7.5') where plastic bead chains were attached to the swivel. The new holders were placed into a rigid foam frame allowing six rats (in six holders) to be placed into the beamline simultaneously. The frame accommodated lengths of plastic bead-chains hanging from a top cross bar. One bead chain was looped through the hole in the plastic swivel, and the free end of the bead chain was affixed to itself using a plastic zip tie. The bead chain was then adjusted at the cross bar to ensure a 30 degree of the body of the relative to the plexiglass floor of the holder, with the hind limbs remaining off the floor. Each holder lid contained a cutout section to permit closure with the tail extending upward toward the cross bar. This process was repeated five more times, such that a total six rats were HU and stacked (3 high; with two rats on the bottom, middle, and top levels) within the foam frame. Rats that did not receive HU were placed into similar plexiglass boxes drilled with airholes and stacked into rigid foam frames, but remained full weight-bearing. Their holders were smaller (8' x 4' x 4'), and were aligned in a matrix of three horizontal capsules and four vertical one for irradiation on the beam line (or sham-irradiation). Rats were then transported to the NSRL facility on each irradiation day for sham-irradiation or radiation exposure. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.     After 2 weeks of acclimatization, and at 9 months of age, they were sham-irradiated or irradiated with a standardized, simplified 5-ion exposure prescribed by NASA and referred to as simGCRsim (consisting of rapid, sequential exposure to protons (1000 MeV/n, LET equals 0.2 keV/mm, 35%), 28Si ions (600 MeV/n, LET equals 50.4 keV/mm, 1%), 4He ions (250 MeV/n, LET equals 1.6 keV/mm, 18%), 16O ions (350 MeV/n, LET equals 16.9 keV/mm, 6%), 56Fe ions (600 MeV/n, LET equals 173.8 keV/mm, 1%), and protons (250 MeV/n, LET equals 0.4 keV/mm, 39%). Rats were exposed to 0 or 1.5 Gy) at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at BNL on May 7 or May 8, 2019. The 1.5 Gy cohort included experimental groups of simulated weightlessness using HU alone and HU in combination with radiation. NSRL GCR and SPE simulations are designed to approximate the chronic mixed field exposures in space by means of sequential acute exposures to a variety of ion/energy combinations.  The exposure protocols are on the NSRL website: https://www.bnl.gov/nsrl/userguide/simgcrsim.php (SimGCRSim).  The dose can be administered either in a single series of exposures lasting approximately an hour or in daily fractions over several weeks.  The GCR simulations are described in detail here: Simonsen LC, Slaba TC, Guida P, Rusek A (2020) NASA’s first ground-based Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: Enabling a new era in space radiobiology research. PLoS Biol 18(5): e3000669. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000669     Nine months following sham-irradiation or irradiation and 6 months after the behavioral and cognitive testing, in February 2020, sham-irradiated rats and rats irradiated at 1.5 Gy, in the absence and presence of HU, were quickly killed using a guillotine without anesthesia. The blood was collected in EDTA-containing tubes, centrifugated at 2,000 g for 10 min and the plasma supernatant collected and stored at -80C.     Metabolites were extracted from 100 uL of plasma using cold methanol:water (8:2, v/v). Samples were homogenized and processed for untargeted metabolomics.     Liquid chromatography (LC) was performed using a Shimadzu Nexera system with an Inertsil Phenyl-3 column (4.6 x 150 mm, 100 angstroms, 5 mm; GL Sciences, Rolling Hills Estates, CA, United States) coupled to a quadrupole time-offlight mass spectrometer (Q-TOF) (AB SCIEX, Triple TOF 5600) operated in information-dependent MS/MS acquisition mode. Samples were ordered randomly and multiple quality control samples were included. QC samples were generated by pooling 10 mL aliquots from plasma samples extracts and analyzed along with the samples. Samples were run in the positive and negative ion mode. In case metabolites were present in both ion modes, the mode with the higher peak value was selected for further analysis. The column temperature was held at 50\u000eC and the samples were kept at 10\u000eC. Three types of quality control samples are included in the study: blank controls, pooled sample extracts, and NIST metabolomics standards (SRM 1950 human plasma).",

          "Study Description": "A limitation of simulated space radiation studies is that radiation exposure is not the only environmental challenge astronauts face during missions. Therefore, we characterized behavioral and cognitive performance of male WAG/Rij rats 3 months after sham-irradiation or total body irradiation with a simplified 5-ion mixed beam exposure in the absence or presence of simulated weightlessness using hindlimb unloading (HU) alone. Six months following behavioral and cognitive testing or 9 months following sham-irradiation or total body irradiation, plasma and brain tissues (hippocampus and cortex) were processed to determine whether the behavioral and cognitive effects were associated with long-term alterations in metabolic pathways in plasma and brain. Sham HU, but not irradiated HU, rats were impaired in spatial habituation learning. Rats irradiated with 1.5 Gy showed increased depressive-like behaviors. This was seen in the absence but not presence of HU. Thus, HU has differential effects in sham-irradiated and irradiated animals and specific behavioral measures are associated with plasma levels of distinct metabolites 6 months later. The combined effects of HU and radiation on metabolic pathways in plasma and brain illustrate the complex interaction of environmental stressors and highlights the importance of assessing these interactions. This study contains plasma metabolomics data. The hippocampus metabolomics data are deposited in OSD-833, the cortex metabolomics data in OSD-834, and the behavioral assay data in OSD-835.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "WAG male rats (n equals 69), a substrain of WAG/Rij, separated from the colony at Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO, Rijswijk, Netherlands), in about 1975, and maintained at Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), were shipped to the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Upton, NY. The hindlimb unloading )HU) procedure was initiated 5 days prior to sham-irradiation or irradiation as described below. On Day 1, the rats were randomly grouped to serve as either full weight-bearing on all four limbs, or to be HU via tail suspension with body weight borne on the two front limbs. The HU procedure was a modified version of the one previously published (Wiley et al., 2016). Briefly, rats were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane (2.5–3.0%; 100% oxygen flow rate). While anesthetized, the tail was cleaned using 70% isopropyl alcohol. Benzoin tincture was applied to the lateral surfaces of the tail prior to the placement of strips (1 cm wide by 30 cm long) of adhesive medical traction tape (3M, St. Paul, MN, United States). The tape was placed approximately 1 cm from base of the tail, spanning distally for approximately the next 3/4ths the length of the tail. The free end of the tape was looped through a catch that was part of a custom-build plastic ball bearing swivel. After passing through the swivel, the tape was symmetrically adhered to the other lateral side of the tail in a similar spatial manner. Three pieces of 1/2-in micropore surgical tape (3M, St. Paul, MN, United States) were secured perpendicularly along the traction tape. A 1.56-in stainless oval wire carabiner clip (Nite Ize, Boulder, CO, United States) was attached through a hole on the top portion of the plastic swivel, with the other end of the carabiner clip attached to a zipper hook that slides along a perlon cord (STAS group, BA, Eindhoven, Netherlands). The cord was attached to a clothesline support separator spreader pulley (Blue Hawk, Gilbert, AZ, United States) that slides along a 5/16-in diameter round, solid steel rod (Hillman, Cincinnati, OH, United States). Once the attachment was complete, the zipper lock was adjusted along the perlon cord to lift the hind limbs fully off the substrate with a pitch angle of the thorax and abdomen 30\u000edegree relative to the horizontal substrate plane. Rats quickly recovered from anesthesia and were monitored closely for the next 24 h. Rats maintained under standard gravitational conditions (non-HU) received isoflurane, but were not tail suspended. All HU and non-HU rats were further subgrouped as to receive one of the two radiation doses (0.75 Gy or 1.5 Gy) or sham-irradiation (0 Gy), and all animals were singly housed. Monitoring over the next 5 days was carefully performed to ensure the HU rats had access to food and water and could move smoothly across the cage, despite the hind limbs not touching the substrate. Wet rodent chow and gel packs were provided to ensure hydration. Corrugated cardboard bedding was supplied to permit burrowing for all rats. On Day 5, animals were transferred from HU or non-HU housing to a new plexiglass box (holder) drilled with air holes for radiation or sham-radiation exposure. HU animals remained suspended through the transferring process by removing the plastic ball bearing from the carabiner and relocating the animal to a plastic plexiglass holder (9.5' x 4' x 7.5') where plastic bead chains were attached to the swivel. The new holders were placed into a rigid foam frame allowing six rats (in six holders) to be placed into the beamline simultaneously. The frame accommodated lengths of plastic bead-chains hanging from a top cross bar. One bead chain was looped through the hole in the plastic swivel, and the free end of the bead chain was affixed to itself using a plastic zip tie. The bead chain was then adjusted at the cross bar to ensure a 30 degree of the body of the relative to the plexiglass floor of the holder, with the hind limbs remaining off the floor. Each holder lid contained a cutout section to permit closure with the tail extending upward toward the cross bar. This process was repeated five more times, such that a total six rats were HU and stacked (3 high; with two rats on the bottom, middle, and top levels) within the foam frame. Rats that did not receive HU were placed into similar plexiglass boxes drilled with airholes and stacked into rigid foam frames, but remained full weight-bearing. Their holders were smaller (8' x 4' x 4'), and were aligned in a matrix of three horizontal capsules and four vertical one for irradiation on the beam line (or sham-irradiation). Rats were then transported to the NSRL facility on each irradiation day for sham-irradiation or radiation exposure. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.     After 2 weeks of acclimatization, and at 9 months of age, they were sham-irradiated or irradiated with a standardized, simplified 5-ion exposure prescribed by NASA and referred to as simGCRsim (consisting of rapid, sequential exposure to protons (1000 MeV/n, LET equals 0.2 keV/mm, 35%), 28Si ions (600 MeV/n, LET equals 50.4 keV/mm, 1%), 4He ions (250 MeV/n, LET equals 1.6 keV/mm, 18%), 16O ions (350 MeV/n, LET equals 16.9 keV/mm, 6%), 56Fe ions (600 MeV/n, LET equals 173.8 keV/mm, 1%), and protons (250 MeV/n, LET equals 0.4 keV/mm, 39%). Rats were exposed to 0 or 1.5 Gy) at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at BNL on May 7 or May 8, 2019. The 1.5 Gy cohort included experimental groups of simulated weightlessness using HU alone and HU in combination with radiation. NSRL GCR and SPE simulations are designed to approximate the chronic mixed field exposures in space by means of sequential acute exposures to a variety of ion/energy combinations. The exposure protocols are on the NSRL website: https://www.bnl.gov/nsrl/userguide/simgcrsim.php (SimGCRSim). The dose can be administered either in a single series of exposures lasting approximately an hour or in daily fractions over several weeks. The GCR simulations are described in detail here: Simonsen LC, Slaba TC, Guida P, Rusek A (2020) NASA’s first ground-based Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: Enabling a new era in space radiobiology research. PLoS Biol 18(5): e3000669. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000669     Nine months following sham-irradiation or irradiation and 6 months after the behavioral and cognitive testing, in February 2020, sham-irradiated rats and rats irradiated at 1.5 Gy, in the absence and presence of HU, were quickly killed using a guillotine without anesthesia. The brain was cut along the midline on ice in PBS and the whole hippocampus and whole cortex were dissected as described\n(Raber et al., 2002) and stored at -80 C.     The tissues were homogenized in 300 mL (per 30 mg of tissues) of cold methanol:water (8:2, v/v). From 100 ml of hippocampal homogenates, metabolites were extracted.     Liquid chromatography (LC) was performed using a Shimadzu Nexera system with an Inertsil Phenyl-3 column (4.6 x 150 mm, 100 angstroms, 5 mm; GL Sciences, Rolling Hills Estates, CA, United States) coupled to a quadrupole time-offlight mass spectrometer (Q-TOF) (AB SCIEX, Triple TOF 5600) operated in information-dependent MS/MS acquisition mode. Samples were ordered randomly and multiple quality control samples were included. QC samples were generated by pooling 10 mL aliquots from plasma samples extracts and analyzed along with the samples. Samples were run in the positive and negative ion mode. In case metabolites were present in both ion modes, the mode with the higher peak value was selected for further analysis. The column temperature was held at 50\u000eC and the samples were kept at 10\u000eC. Multiple types of quality control samples are included in the study: : blank controls; QC1, consisting of 10 µL from each hippocampus sample; QC2, consisting of 10 µL from each cortex sample; QC3, a pooled mix of equal volumes of QC1 and QC2; and NIST metabolomics standards (SRM 1950 human plasma).",

          "Study Description": "A limitation of simulated space radiation studies is that radiation exposure is not the only environmental challenge astronauts face during missions. Therefore, we characterized behavioral and cognitive performance of male WAG/Rij rats 3 months after sham-irradiation or total body irradiation with a simplified 5-ion mixed beam exposure in the absence or presence of simulated weightlessness using hindlimb unloading (HU) alone. Six months following behavioral and cognitive testing or 9 months following sham-irradiation or total body irradiation, plasma and brain tissues (hippocampus and cortex) were processed to determine whether the behavioral and cognitive effects were associated with long-term alterations in metabolic pathways in plasma and brain. Sham HU, but not irradiated HU, rats were impaired in spatial habituation learning. Rats irradiated with 1.5 Gy showed increased depressive-like behaviors. This was seen in the absence but not presence of HU. Thus, HU has differential effects in sham-irradiated and irradiated animals and specific behavioral measures are associated with plasma levels of distinct metabolites 6 months later. The combined effects of HU and radiation on metabolic pathways in plasma and brain illustrate the complex interaction of environmental stressors and highlights the importance of assessing these interactions. This study contains hippocampus metabolomics data. The plasma metabolomics data are deposited in OSD-832, the cortex metabolomics data in OSD-834, and the behavioral assay data in OSD-835.",

Sixty 3-month-old C57Bl/6J mice (30 males and 30 females) were used. We exposed 3-month-old male and female age-matched mice to 100 cGy, 0.662 MeV of 137Cs-gamma-IR (20 animals, male/female: 10/10) and 50 cGy 500 MeV/nucleon simGCRsim-IR (20 animals, male/female: 10/10), whereas control mice (20 animals, male/female: 10/10) were not irradiated. Animals were monitored at least once a day for any physical or behavioral changes that might indicate distress, discomfort, pain, or injury. Only mice showing general signs of poor health and distress (e.g., rapid heart/respiratory rate, oral/nasal discharge, wound dehiscence, marked swelling, ulcerating neoplasms greater than 2 cm or ulcerating, inability to eat/drink, or weight loss greater than15%) were immediately euthanized using 100% CO2 at 20% air replacement per minute rate, followed by cervical dislocation.

At 9 months of age, they were sham-irradiated or irradiated with photons (3, 8, or 10 Gy). Experimental groups of simulated weightlessness using HU alone and HU in combination with photon irradiation were included as part of the paradigm. The HU procedure was performed 5 days prior to sham irradiation or irradiation. The rats remained under the HU condition, 25 days after sham irradiation or irradiation. One week after the HU period, the animals were shipped to the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW). The animals were maintained on a Teklad 8904 diet (Indianapolis, IN) and fed ad libitum during this study. The animals were housed in a reverse-light cycle room with lights off from 07.30 to 19.30. All behavioral and cognitive testing was performed during the dark period, starting 2 months after irradiation or sham irradiation and over 1 month after the HU procedure. All animal procedures were consistent with ARRIVE guidelines and reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine and MCW. All analyses were performed blinded to treatment. On day 1, the rats were randomly grouped to serve as either full weight-bearing (non-HU) or to be HU via tail suspension. Briefly, the rats were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane (2.5%–3.0%; 5% oxygen flow rate). Benzoin tincture was applied to the cleaned, lateral surfaces of the tail before placing a free end of the adhesive medical traction tape (1-cm width, 30-cm length, 3M, St. Paul, MN, United States) at approximately 1 cm from the base of the tail and then adhered to 3/4th of the length of the tail. The free end of the tape was looped through a catch on a custom plastic ball-bearing swivel and symmetrically adhered to the other lateral side of the tail. Half-inch micropore tape (3M, St. Paul, MN, United States) strips were then secured perpendicularly over the traction tape. A 1.56-inch carabiner clip (Nite Ize, Boulder, CO, United States) was attached to both the swivel and a zipper hook that could be adjusted vertically along an attached perlon cord (STAS Group, BA, Eindhoven, Netherlands). The cord was attached to a pulley (Blue Hawk, Gilbert, AZ, United States) that permitted the entire setup to slide securely over a 5/16-inch-diameter round, solid steel rod (Hillman, Cincinnati, OH, United States). The adjustment of the zipper lock along the Perlon cord lifted the hind limbs fully off the substrate, with the abdomen and thorax at a 30-degree horizontal form. Sham HU rats received isoflurane but were not tail-suspended. All rats were singly housed, assigned to receive one of the three radiation doses (3, 8, or 10 Gy) or sham irradiation (0 Gy). Wet chow was provided to ensure hydration.     The animals were placed on the treatment couch of an Elekta 6-MV photon linear accelerator (Elekta Synergy, Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden).  Doses were delivered in two fractions, using laterally opposed beams at 0.5 Gy/min. For both HU and sham HU groups, 4 cm of homogenous brass shielding was placed between the hind limbs from the beam to permit the repopulation of hematopoietic stem cells; dosimetry was performed with shielding in place. Following irradiation procedures, the rats were immediately returned to normal housing conditions (HU or full weight-bearing).     Exploratory behavior, measures of anxiety, and hippocampus-dependent spatial habituation learning were assessed in a black open field for 2 subsequent days. On day 3, the rats were tested in the open field containing objects. In the week following open-field and object recognition testing, anhedonia of the rats was tested for 3 days. Elevated Plus Maze was performed during week 3.     All behavioral and cognitive testing was performed during the dark period, starting 2 months after irradiation or sham irradiation and over 1 month after the HU procedure. For open-field testing, each experimental group had 10 rats/ group, with the exception of the non-HU 8-Gy and HU 8-Gy groups, which had 9 rats/group, for a total of 78 rats. The animal cage was brought into the testing room. The rat was picked up by gently placing our thumb and forefinger behind the forelegs and wrapping the hand around the stomach. The researcher held the animal against the stomach while transporting the animal to or from the enclosure. The researcher left the testing room during beavioral testing. Following testing of each rat, the enclosure was cleaned with a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution. The light intensity during open-field and object recognition testing was 50 lux. A white noise generator (setting II) and overhead lights were used during the testing.     Exploratory behavior, measures of anxiety, and hippocampus dependent spatial habituation learning were assessed in a black open field (90.49 cm × 90.49 cm × 45.72 cm), with center zone (45.25 × 45.25 cm).     The animal was placed in the middle of the open field for 5 min per day. The researcher left the testing room during behavioral testing.     The outcome measures analyzed using video tracking (ANY-maze software, Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL, United States) were the total distance moved, the time spent freezing, and the percentage of time spent in the more anxiety-provoking center zone (45.25 × 45.25 cm). Freezing is defined as the lack of movement besides respiration.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining. The transformed column headers and the submitted term from which they derive are defined in the study data dictionary file.     Exploratory behavior, measures of anxiety, and hippocampus-dependent spatial habituation learning were assessed in a black open field for 2 subsequent days. On day 3, the rats were tested in the open field containing objects. In the week following open-field and object recognition testing, anhedonia of the rats was tested for 3 days. Elevated Plus Maze was performed during week 3.     All behavioral and cognitive testing was performed during the dark period. The rats were tested in the open field containing 3D-printed objects. The light intensity during open-field and object recognition testing was 50 lux. A white noise generator (setting II) and overhead lights were used during the testing. The animal cage was brought into the testing room. The rat was picked up by gently placing our thumb and forefinger behind the forelegs and wrapping the hand around the stomach. The researcher held the animal against the stomach while transporting the animal to or from the enclosure.  The researcher left the testing room during behavioral testing. Following testing of each rat, the enclosure was cleaned with a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution.     The animals were first habituated to an open field one orange object and one cover of a 50 ml conical tube for 5 min. The objects were placed 45.72 cm from the top side of the enclosure and 30.48 cm from the left and right sides of the enclosure. The distance between the two objects was also 30.48 cm. Five minutes following the habituation trial (H), the rats were placed back in the enclosure containing two identical red cylinders (3.8 cm diameter, 3.5 cm height, untextured) or blue squares (3.5 cm base length, 3.5 cm height, textured) for an acquisition trial. The objects were counterbalanced for this task. Half of the rats started with the blue squares and the other half started with the red cylinders.     The animal was placed in the middle of the open field for 5 min per day. 60 min following the acquisition trial (A), the rats were placed back in the enclosure with one of the familiar objects replaced with a novel red or blue object for a test trial (T).     The outcome measures analyzed using video tracking were the total distance moved and percentage of time spent in the center zone (45.25 × 45.25 cm) containing the objects. In addition, the discrimination index, defined as the time spent exploring the novel object minus the time spent with the familiar object divided by the time spent exploring both objects, was analyzed by manual scoring of the digital videos.     Exploratory behavior, measures of anxiety, and hippocampus-dependent spatial habituation learning were assessed in a black open field for 2 subsequent days. On day 3, the rats were tested in the open field containing objects. In the week following open-field and object recognition testing, anhedonia of the rats was tested for 3 days. Elevated Plus Maze was performed during week 3.     All behavioral and cognitive testing was performed during the dark period, starting 2 months after irradiation or sham irradiation and over 1 month after the HU procedure. Following testing of each rat, the enclosure was cleaned with a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution.     Measures of anxiety-like behavior were assessed in the elevated plus maze. The arms were 50 cm long, 10 cm wide, and 40 cm high. The maze was positioned 50 cm above the floor.     The duration of the test on the plus maze was 5 minutes.     The following distinct outcomes were measured using ANY-maze video tracking software: 1) ratios of the time spent in the open areas (defined as time spent in the open arms divided by time spent in the open + closed arms); 2) ratios of the entries in the open arms (entries into the open areas divided by entries into the open + closed arms); 3) distance moved in the open and closed arms; 4) time spent mobile; 5) time spent freezing; and 6) time spent in the intersection.     Exploratory behavior, measures of anxiety, and hippocampus-dependent spatial habituation learning were assessed in a black open field for 2 subsequent days. On day 3, the rats were tested in the open field containing objects. In the week following open-field and object recognition testing, anhedonia of the rats was tested for 3 days. Elevated Plus Maze was performed during week 3. All behavioral and cognitive testing was performed during the dark period, starting 2 months after irradiation or sham irradiation and over 1 month after the HU procedure.     In our study, we provided 10 g of chocolate candy for 1 h at a time every 3 days, and there were maybe one or two incidents where we provided an additional 2 g. On day 1, each rat received 2 candies (multi-colored button-shaped chocolates, Mars Inc., McLean, VA, United States) in the home cage. For anhedonia testing, all experimental groups had 12 rats/group, with the exception of the non-HU 3-Gy group and the HU 0 (11 rats)- and 3-Gy groups (13 rats), for a total of 97 rats. Consumption was assessed after 10 min by weighing the remaining chocolates. On days 2–4, the rats were moved into a testing room, separate from the housing room. Each rat was placed in a clean cage without bedding (no available food or water) and allowed to habituate for 1 h. A pre-weighed weighing boat containing 10 g of chocolates was placed in the center of the cage. The weighing boat was attached to the bottom of the cage using a tape. The chocolate-filled weighing boat was left in the cage for up to 1 h. If the weighing boat was empty before the end of the hour, a new weighing boat with chocolates was placed in the cage. After 1 h, the animal was placed back in its home cage. The weighing boat was removed from the testing cage. Any chocolate crumbs were removed from the cage and placed in the weighing boat if they were not soiled by rat feces. The weighing boat containing chocolates was weighed again to calculate chocolate consumption for that day. The average consumption of chocolates over the 3 days of testing and the percentage of chocolates consumed on days 2 and 3 compared to day 1 were calculated.",

          "Study Description": "The space environment astronauts experience during space missions consists of multiple environmental challenges, including microgravity. In this study, we assessed the behavioral and cognitive performances of male Fisher rats 2 months after sham irradiation or total body irradiation with photons in the absence or presence of simulated microgravity. We analyzed the plasma collected 9 months after sham irradiation or total body irradiation for distinct alterations in metabolic pathways and to determine whether changes to metabolic measures were associated with specific behavioral and cognitive measures. A total of 344 male Fischer rats were irradiated with photons (6 MeV; 3, 8, or 10 Gy) in the absence or presence of simulated weightlessness achieved using hindlimb unloading (HU). To identify potential plasma biomarkers of photon radiation exposure or the HU condition for behavioral or cognitive performance, we performed regression analyses. The behavioral effects of HU on activity levels in an open field, measures of anxiety in an elevated plus maze, and anhedonia in the MandM consumption test were more pronounced than those of photon irradiation. Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan metabolism, and phenylalanine metabolism and biosynthesis showed very strong pathway changes, following photon irradiation and HU in animals irradiated with 3 Gy. Here, 29 out of 101 plasma metabolites were associated with 1 out of 13 behavioral measures. In the absence of HU, 22 metabolites were related to behavioral and cognitive measures. In HU animals that were sham-irradiated or irradiated with 8 Gy, one metabolite was related to behavioral and cognitive measures. In HU animals irradiated with 3 Gy, six metabolites were related to behavioral and cognitive measures. These data suggest that it will be possible to develop stable plasma biomarkers of behavioral and cognitive performance, following environmental challenges like HU and radiation exposure. This study derives results from the Open Field, Novel Object Recognition and Anhedonia, and Elevated Plus Maze behavior assays.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "The HU procedure was performed 5 days prior to sham-irradiation or irradiation. The rats remained in the HU condition for 25 days following sham-irradiation or irradiation. At the end of one week following the HU period, the animals were shipped to the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW). The animals were then maintained on a Teklad 8904 diet (Indianapolis, IN, United States) and fed ad libitum during the study. The animals were housed in a reverse light cycle room with lights off from 07.30–19.30. All behavioral and cognitive tests were performed during the dark period starting 2 months after irradiation or sham-irradiation. All animal procedures were consistent with ARRIVE guidelines and were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at BNL and MCW. All analyses were performed blinded to the treatment. On day 1, the rats were randomly grouped into full weightbearing (non-HU), HU via tail suspension, or no HU (sham). In brief, the rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (2.5%–3.0% at 5% oxygen flow rate). Then, a tincture of benzoin was applied to the lateral surface of the tail before placing one of the free ends of an adhesive medical traction tape (3M, St. Paul, MN, United States) starting approximately 1 cm from the base of the tail and adhering up to 3/4th of the tail length. The free end was then looped through a catch on a plastic ball-bearing swivel and adhered to the opposite lateral side of the tail. Strips of micropore tape (3M) were adhered perpendicularly over the traction tape. A 1.56-inch carabiner clip (Nite Ize, Boulder, CO, United States) was connected to the swivel and a zipper hook to permit vertical adjustment along an attached Perlon cord (STAS group, BA, Eindhoven, the Netherlands). The cord was then connected to a pulley (Blue Hawk, Gilbert, AZ, United States) that permitted the setup to slide securely over a 5/16-inch-diameter steel rod (Hillman, Cincinnati, OH, United States). Adjustment of the zipper lock lifted the hind limbs off the substrate, with the abdomen and thorax suspended at 30° from the horizontal plane. The sham HU rats received isoflurane but were not tail suspended. For placement along the beamline for both the irradiation and sham procedures, the swivel was disconnected from the carabiner clip, and a plastic bead chain cord (Luanxu, Guangzhou City, China) was looped through the swivel at the point of the carabiner attachment. The rats were then transferred to specialized rat boxes in 60 cm × 60 cm aluminum frames, and the bead chain lengths were adjusted to ensure that the hind limbs remained suspended at the same angle as in the HU cages. The bead chain was then placed in a slot at the top of the frame to ensure suspension of the rodent hind limbs, and the swivel permitted rotation in the boxes.     Male 7–8 months old Fischer 344 rats (RRID:RGD_734478) (n of 132) were shipped to the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Upton, NY, United States. After 2 weeks of acclimatization and at 9 months of age, they were sham-irradiated or irradiated with a standardized simplified 5-ion 6-beam prescribed by NASA referred to as simGCRsim, which consists of sequential and rapidly switched exposures to protons (1000 MeV/n), 28Si ions (250 MeV/n), 4He ions (350 MeV/n), 16O ions (600 MeV/n), 56Fe ions (250 MeV/n), and protons (250 MeV/n) (0, 0.75, or 1.5 Gy) in the absence or presence of simulated weightlessness achieved by HU or a control HU condition. NSRL GCR and SPE simulations are designed to approximate the chronic mixed field exposures in space by means of sequential acute exposures to a variety of ion/energy combinations.  The exposure protocols are on the NSRL website:  https://www.bnl.gov/nsrl/userguide/simgcrsim.php (SimGCRSim).  The dose can be administered either in a single series of exposures lasting approximately an hour or in daily fractions over several weeks.  The GCR simulations are described in detail here: Simonsen LC, Slaba TC, Guida P, Rusek A (2020) NASA’s first ground-based Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: Enabling a new era in space radiobiology research. PLoS Biol 18(5): e3000669. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000669. The control HU condition was identical to the HU condition with the exception that the animals could use all four paws for movement.     Exploratory behaviors, measures of anxiety, and hippocampus dependent spatial habituation learning were assessed in a black open field  during three consecutive days.     All behavioral and cognitive tests were performed during the dark period. The animal cages were brought into the testing room; then, the rats were picked up gently by placing the thumb and forefinger behind the forelegs and wrapping the palm around the stomach. The researchers supported the animals by their stomachs during transportation to and from the enclosure.  Following the testing of each rat, the enclosure was cleaned with a solution of 70% isopropyl alcohol.  The light intensity during the open field and object recognition tests was 50 lux. A white noise generator (setting II) and overhead lights were used during testing.     Animals were assessed in a black open field (90.49 cm × 90.49 cm × 45.72 cm) with an anxiety provoking center zone (45.25 cm × 45.25 cm).     The animals were placed in the middle of the open field for 5 min each day. The researchers vacated the testing room during behavioral testing.     The outcome measures analyzed using video tracking (AnyMaze software, Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL, United States) were the total distance moved, time spent freezing, and percentage of time spent in the more anxiety provoking center zone (45.25 cm × 45.25 cm).

The objects were placed 45.72 cm from the top side of the enclosure and 30.48 cm from the left and right sides of the enclosure. The distance between the two objects was also 30.48 cm. Five minutes following the habituation trial (H), the rats were placed back in the enclosure containing two identical blue squares (3.5 cm base length, 3.5 cm height, textured) or two identical red cylinders (3.8 cm diameter, 3.5 cm height, untextured) for an acquisition trial. The objects were counterbalanced for this task. Half of the rats started with the blue squares and the other half started with the red cylinders.

          "Study Description": "Effects and interactions between different spaceflight stressors are expected to be experienced by crew on missions when exposed to microgravity and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). One of the limitations of previous studies on simulated weightlessness using hindlimb unloading (HU) is that a control HU condition was not included. We characterized the behavioral performance of male Fischer rats 2 months after sham or total body irradiation with a simplified 5-ion 6-mixed-beam exposure representative of GCRs in the absence or presence of HU. Six months later, the plasma, hippocampus, and cortex were processed to determine whether the behavioral effects were associated with long-term alterations in the metabolic pathways. In the open field without and with objects, interactions were observed for radiation × HU. In the plasma of animals that were not under the HU or control HU condition, the riboflavin metabolic pathway was affected most for sham irradiation vs. 0.75 Gy exposure. Analysis of the effects of control HU on plasma in the sham-irradiated animals showed that the alanine, aspartate, glutamate, riboflavin, and glutamine metabolisms as well as arginine biosynthesis were affected. The effects of control HU on the hippocampus in the sham-irradiated animals showed that the phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan pathway was affected the most. Analysis of effects of 0.75 Gy irradiation on the cortex of control HU animals showed that the glutamine and glutamate metabolic pathway was affected similar to the hippocampus, while the riboflavin pathway was affected in animals that were not under the control HU condition. The effects of control HU on the cortex in sham-irradiated animals showed that the riboflavin metabolic pathway was affected. Animals receiving 0.75 Gy of irradiation showed impaired glutamine and glutamate metabolic pathway, whereas animals receiving 1.5 Gy of irradiation showed impaired riboflavin metabolic pathways. A total of 21 plasma metabolites were correlated with the behavioral measures, indicating that plasma and brain biomarkers associated with behavioral performance are dependent on the environmental conditions experienced. This study derives results from the Open Field and Novel Object Recognition behavior assays.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "On Day 1, WAG male rats (n equals 69), a substrain of WAG/Rij separated from the colony at Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO, Rijswijk, Netherlands) in about 1975 and maintained at Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), were randomly grouped to serve as either full weight-bearing on all four limbs, or to be hindlimb unloaded (HU) via tail suspension with body weight borne on the two front limbs. Briefly, rats were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane (2.5–3.0 %; 100 % oxygen flow rate). While anesthetized, the tail was cleaned using 70 % isopropyl alcohol. Benzoin tincture was applied to the lateral surfaces of the tail prior to the placement of strips (1 cm wide by 30 cm long) of adhesive medical traction tape (3M, St. Paul, MN, United States). The tape was placed approximately 1 cm from base of the tail, spanning distally for approximately the next 3/4ths the length of the tail. The free end of the tape was looped through a catch that was part of a custom-build plastic ball bearing swivel. After passing through the swivel, the tape was symmetrically adhered to the other lateral side of the tail in a similar spatial manner. Three pieces of 1/2-in micropore surgical tape (3M, St. Paul, MN, United States) were secured perpendicularly along the traction tape. A 1.56-in stainless oval wire carabiner clip (Nite Ize, Boulder, CO, United States) was attached through a hole on the top portion of the plastic swivel, with the other end of the carabiner clip attached to a zipper hook that slides along a perlon cord (STAS group, BA, Eindhoven, Netherlands). The cord was attached to a clothesline support separator spreader pulley (Blue Hawk, Gilbert, AZ, United States) that slides along a 5/16-in diameter round, solid steel rod (Hillman, Cincinnati, OH, United States). Once the attachment was complete, the zipper lock was adjusted along the perlon cord to lift the hind limbs fully off the substrate with a pitch angle of the thorax and abdomen 30 degrees relative to the horizontal substrate plane. Rats quickly recovered from anesthesia and were monitored closely for the next 24 h. Rats maintained under standard gravitational conditions (non- HU) received isoflurane, but were not tail suspended. All HU and non-HU rats were further subgrouped as to receive one of the two radiation doses (0.75 Gy or 1.5 Gy) or sham-irradiation (0 Gy), and all animals were singly housed. Monitoring over the next 5 days was carefully performed to ensure the HU rats had access to food and water and could move smoothly across the cage, despite the hind limbs not touching the substrate. Wet rodent chow and gel packs were provided to ensure hydration. Corrugated cardboard bedding was supplied to permit burrowing for all rats. On Day 5, animals were transferred from HU or non- HU housing to a new plexiglass box (holder) drilled with air holes for radiation or sham-radiation exposure. HU animals remained suspended through the transferring process by removing the plastic ball bearing from the carabiner and relocating the animal to a plastic plexiglass holder (9.5 x 4 x 7.5 inches) where plastic bead chains were attached to the swivel. The new holders were placed into a rigid foam frame allowing six rats (in six holders) to be placed into the beamline simultaneously. The frame accommodated lengths of plastic bead-chains hanging from a top cross bar. One bead chain was looped through the hole in the plastic swivel, and the free end of the bead chain was affixed to itself using a plastic zip tie. The bead chain was then adjusted at the cross bar to ensure that the body was at a 30 degree angle relative to the plexiglass floor of the holder, with the hind limbs remaining off the floor. Each holder lid contained a cutout section to permit closure with the tail extending upward toward the cross bar. This process was repeated five more times, such that a total six rats were HU and stacked (3 high; with two rats on the bottom, middle, and top levels) within the foam frame. Rats that did not receive HU were placed into similar plexiglass boxes drilled with airholes and stacked into rigid foam frames, but remained full weight-bearing. Their holders were smaller (8 x 4 x 4 inches), and were aligned in a matrix of three horizontal capsules and four vertical one for irradiation on the beam line (or sham-irradiation). Rats were then transported to the NSRL facility on each irradiation day for sham-irradiation or radiation exposure. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.     Rats were shipped to the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Upton, NY. After 2 weeks of acclimatization, and at 9 months of age, they were sham-irradiated or irradiated with a standardized, simplified 5-ion exposure prescribed by NASA and referred to as simGCRsim (consisting of rapid, sequential exposure to protons (1000 MeV/n, LET equals 0.2 keV/mm, 35%), 28Si ions (600 MeV/n, LET equals 50.4 keV/mm, 1%), 4He ions (250 MeV/n, LET equals 1.6 keV/mm, 18%), 16O ions (350 MeV/n, LET equals 16.9 keV/mm, 6%), 56Fe ions (600 MeV/n, LET equals 173.8 keV/mm, 1%), and protons (250 MeV/n, LET equals 0.4 keV/mm, 39%). Rats were exposed to 0, 0.75 Gy or 1.5 Gy) at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at BNL on May 7 or May 8, 2019. NSRL GCR and SPE simulations are designed to approximate the chronic mixed field exposures in space by means of sequential acute exposures to a variety of ion/energy combinations.  The exposure protocols are on the NSRL website:  https://www.bnl.gov/nsrl/userguide/simgcrsim.php (simGCRSim).  The dose can be administered either in a single series of exposures lasting approximately an hour or in daily fractions over several weeks.  The GCR simulations are described in detail here: Simonsen LC, Slaba TC, Guida P, Rusek A (2020) NASA’s first ground-based Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: Enabling a new era in space radiobiology research. PLoS Biol 18(5): e3000669. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000669. The 1.5 Gy cohort included experimental groups of simulated weightlessness using HU alone and HU in combination with radiation.     Behavioral studies were initiated 3 months following radiation or sham-irradiation, in August 2019.     All behavioral and cognitive testing was performed during the dark period. The animal cage was brought into the testing room. The rat was picked up gently placing thumb and forefinger behind the fore legs and wrapping the hand around the stomach. The researcher held the animal against the stomach while transporting the animal to or from the enclosure. Following testing of a rat, the enclosure was cleaned with a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution. The light intensity during open field and object recognition testing was 50 lux. A white noise generator (setting II) and overhead lights were used during the testing.     Starting 3 months post-irradiation or sham-irradiation, exploratory behavior, measures of anxiety, and hippocampus-dependent spatial habituation learning were assessed in a black open field (90.49 cm x 90.49 cm x 45.72 cm) with a center zone (45.25 x 45.25 cm) during two consecutive days.     The rats were placed in the open field for 5 min per day.     Outcome measures analyzed using video tracking (Noldus Ethovision XT13, Wageningen, Netherlands) were the total distance moved and the percent time spent in the more anxiety-provoking center zone (45.25 x 45.25 cm).     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining. The transformed column headers and the submitted term from which they derive are defined in the study data dictionary file.     Following 2 days of Open Field testing, on day 3, the rats were tested in the open field containing 3D printed objects.     All behavioral and cognitive testing was performed during the dark period. The rat was picked up gently placing thumb and fore finger behind the fore legs and wrapping the hand around the stomach. The researcher held the animal against the stomach while transporting the animal to or from the enclosure. The animal was placed in the middle of the open field. The researcher left the testing room during behavioral testing. Following testing of a rat, the enclosure was cleaned with a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution. The light intensity during open field and object recognition testing was 50 lux. A white noise generator (setting II) and overhead lights were used during the testing.     The animals were first habituated to an open field one orange object and one cover of a 50 ml conical tube for 5 min. The objects were placed 45.72 cm from the top side of the enclosure and 30.48 cm from the left and right sides of the enclosure. The distance between the two objects was also 30.48 cm. Five minutes following the habituation trial (H), the rats were placed back in the enclosure containing two identical red cylinders (3.8 cm diameter, 3.5 cm height, untextured) or blue squares (3.5 cm base length, 3.5 cm height, textured) for an acquisition trial. The objects were counterbalanced for this task. Half of the rats started with the blue squares and the other half started with the red cylinders.     Sixty minutes following the acquisition trial (A), the rats were placed back in the enclosure with one of the familiar objects replaced with a novel red or blue object for a test trial (T).     Outcome measures analyzed using video tracking were the total distance moved and percent time spent in the center zone (45.25 x 45.25 cm) containing the objects. In addition, the percent time the animals explored the novel and familiar objects in the test trial was analyzed by manual scoring of the digital videos and the discrimination index was calculated. The “discrimination index” was defined as [the time spent exploring the novel object (s)] – [time spent exploring the familiar object (s)]/(total time spent exploring both objects).     Following open field and object recognition testing, depressive like behaviors of the rats were tested in the forced swim test. All behavioral and cognitive testing was performed during the dark period.     A white noise generator (setting II) and overhead lights were used during the test.     Rats were placed inside transparent round cylinders (91.44 cm high, diameter: 20.38 cm) filled 2/3 with water (28 degrees C) to a designated level (60.69 cm) that allowed the tail, but not hind paws, to touch the bottom of the cylinder. A white noise generator (setting II) and overhead lights were used during the test. The rats were tested two at a time with an opaque separator placed between the two set ups. After 2–3 animals, the water was removed, and the cylinder was refilled with clean water. The light intensity during the forced swim testing was 120 lux.     Rats were placed inside transparent round cylinders  filled 2/3 with water to a designated level that allowed the tail, but not hind paws, to touch the bottom of the cylinder. The rats were place in the cylinder for 6 min. Following removal from the water, they were dried off with paper towels, and monitored for 5 min in a warmed cage before being returned to their home cage.     The outcome measure was the percentage of time the rats were immobile during the period of the test, as analyzed by manual scoring of the digital videos.",

          "Study Description": "A limitation of simulated space radiation studies is that radiation exposure is not the only environmental challenge astronauts face during missions. Therefore, we characterized behavioral and cognitive performance of male WAG/Rij rats 3 months after sham-irradiation or total body irradiation with a simplified 5-ion mixed beam exposure in the absence or presence of simulated weightlessness using hindlimb unloading (HU) alone. Six months following behavioral and cognitive testing or 9 months following sham-irradiation or total body irradiation, plasma and brain tissues (hippocampus and cortex) were processed to determine whether the behavioral and cognitive effects were associated with long-term alterations in metabolic pathways in plasma and brain. Sham HU, but not irradiated HU, rats were impaired in spatial habituation learning. Rats irradiated with 1.5 Gy showed increased depressive-like behaviors. This was seen in the absence but not presence of HU. Thus, HU has differential effects in sham-irradiated and irradiated animals and specific behavioral measures are associated with plasma levels of distinct metabolites 6 months later. The combined effects of HU and radiation on metabolic pathways in plasma and brain illustrate the complex interaction of environmental stressors and highlights the importance of assessing these interactions. This study derives results from the Open Field, Novel Object Recognition and Forced Swim Test behavior assays.",

The mice (4 weeks) were housed (three mice/cage) in a controlled (22 C, 45±10% humidity, 12 h light/dark cycle) environment. All animal-related experiments were conducted as per the guidelines and regulations of the care and use of laboratory animals and received approval from the animal center of Zaozhuang University (Shandong, China).     The control group (n equals 3) was not exposed to any irradiation. The irradiated group (n equals 3) received X-ray irradiation at 25 C with a dose of 6 Gy (800 cGy/min, radiation distance 40 cm).     Following a 24-hour period，all mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of sodium pentobarbital with the dose of 50 mg/kg and their thymus tissues were collected, and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen.     The tissues were processed for RNA isolation using the TRIzol method.     The library was constructed using the NEBNext Multiplex Prep kit Illumina and the UltraTM RNA Library Prep Kit (NEB, USA).     These RNA samples were transported on dry ice to an external company (Genechem Experimental Department) for sequencing.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of Mus-musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 13-May-2024.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Colorado State University (CSU). Eight-week-old C57BL/6 mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were group-housed and received ad libitum standard diet (Teklad 2018) and water. Mice were harem mated at 9–15 weeks of age and the presence of a vaginal plug the morning after mating was defined as embryonic day (E) 0.5. After confirming copulatory plugs, 80 pregnant mice were randomly allocated to control or radiation groups for the duration of pregnancy (E0.5-E18.5) at NASA’s CSU Neutron Radiation Facility.     Radiation groups were exposed to near-continuous neutron irradiation (21 hours/day) using Californium-252 at a dose-rate of 1 mGy/day as determined by dosimeters located in the mouse cages. Californium-252 emits 2.34 × 10^12 neutrons per second per gram by spontaneous fission; this species has been utilized as a terrestrial GCR analog for the simulation of high linear energy transfer (LET) exposures expected during spaceflight. For the dose from neutrons as a function of LET, the dose-averaged value was calculated to be 68 keV/µm. The mixed fluence is a combination of neutrons and photons directly from the source and spallation. This approach resulted in an average daily dose to each animal of 1mGy per day. Control groups were maintained in a vivarium approximately 100  yards away on the same campus and were exposed only to the background radiation rate of 0.005 mGy/day which is typical for the elevation at CSU. Food and water consumption could not be strictly determined due to time limitations of staff operating within the radiation facility; however, pregnancy weight trajectories were monitored. All animals were maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle with light hours from 0700-1900 daily.     On gestational day 18.5 (E18.5; full term, with anticipated pregnancy duration of ~19.5 days), the remaining radiation exposure group (21 dams) and control group (20 dams) were euthanized in an identical fashion for tissue collection including maternal serum and uteri. One dam in the radiation group was excluded due to the delivery of her pups just prior to euthanasia leaving 20 for analysis. Following hysterectomy, rates of early or late resorption were recorded via gross inspection. Fetuses were removed and placed in iced phosphate buffered saline (PBS) before body weight and length were recorded and pups were evaluated for anomalies. Late resorptions were defined by fetal remains with no discernable anatomy. Placentas were removed, the amnion was removed, and placentas were weighed, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 C until subsequent analyses, including placental cell signaling and gene expression studies.     RNA sequencing was performed on one randomly selected placenta from each of 15 irradiated E18.5 litters and 15 control litters. The RNA from each of the 30 individual placentas was isolated using a Qiagen RNeasy mini kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. Next, a reverse transcriptase reaction was performed using the Qiagen Quantitect RT kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The resulting cDNA was then subjected to quantitative PCR. RNA purity, quantity and integrity was determined with NanoDrop (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and TapeStation 4200 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) analysis prior to RNA-seq library preparation.     The Universal Plus mRNA-Seq library preparation kit with NuQuant was used (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) with an input of 200 ng of total RNA to generate RNA-Seq libraries.     Paired-end sequencing reads of 150 bp were generated on NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) sequencer and de-multiplexed using bcl2fastq.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of Mus-musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 13-May-2024.",

We determined the impact of near-continuous low-dose-rate Californium-252 neutron irradiation (1 mGy/day) as a space-relevant analog on litter size and number of resorptions at embryonic day (E) 12.5 (n  equals 19 radiated dams, n  equals  20 controls) and litter size, number of resorptions, fetal growth, and placental signaling and transcriptome (RNA sequencing) at E18.5 (n  equals  21 radiated dams, n  equals  20 controls) in pregnant mice. A significantly increased early resorption rate and decreased placental weight were observed in irradiated mice. There were no statistically significant differences in litter size, fetal weight, length, or malformation rate between the groups. Near-continuous radiation had no significant effects on the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), endoplasmic reticulum stress or inflammatory signaling, rate of double-stranded DNA breaks, and had minimal effects on gene expression in the placenta. These data suggest that near-continuous, low-level galactic cosmic radiation has a limited impact on pregnancy outcomes.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Subjects were Sprague–Dawley (S–D, Taconic Farms) rats weighing 201–225g at the start of the experiment and housed in animal facilities accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Five days following irradiation the rats were shipped to the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) for training and testing. The facilities at UMBC are supervised by the Veterinary Services Department of the University of Maryland, Baltimore Medical School. At both facilities subjects were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle in a temperature and humidity controlled room. Experiments were completed during the light phase of the cycle. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of both BNL and UMBC.     Rats were radiated with 56Fe particles (1000 MeV/n) at a nominal dose rate of 100 cGy/min at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at BNL. For irradiation, rats were placed in well-ventilated clear plastic restraining tubes. Exposure was done from the side of the rat using a non-collimated 20 cm diameter beam. The tubes were positioned so that the head of the rat was located in the center of the beam as determined by an X-ray of the setup. The body of the rat was shielded by tungsten blocks, limiting exposure to the head and neck. Rats were not anesthetized during irradiation, which may have produced restraint stress. However, it is unlikely that stress affected the results of the experiments because behavioral testing did not begin until 2–3 months following exposure. Dosimetry was performed by the staff of the NSRL. Control rats were taken to the NSRL but not irradiated. For the first experiment, rats were exposed to different doses of 56Fe particles: 0cGy (control non-irradiated [n equals 8]), 50cGy (n equals 8), 80cGy (n equals 9), 100cGy (n equals 8), 150 cGy (n equals 8) and 200 cGy (n equals 9).For the second experiment 112 experimentally naive male S–D rats weighing 250–275 g at time of radiation were exposed to 150 cGy of 56Fe particles. The sample sizes were 10 rats in each diet group and eight rats in each diet control group. GeneLab calculated exposure duration based on absorbed radiation dose and dose rate.     Experiments were completed during the light phase of the cycle. Subjects were tested in an open field composed of black Plexiglas (93 cm  93 cm). The open field and the objects were cleaned with dilute alcohol after each subject. During the experiment the arena was dimly illuminated by a 25 watt bulb.     Subjects were tested in an open field composed of black Plexiglas (93 cm  93 cm). The two stimulus objects were ceramic figurines that varied in shape, color, and size. They were no smaller than a rat and no larger than two and a half times the size of a rat. Velcro was used to secure the objects in position. On the test day (24 h later) the familiar object and a novel object were placed into the arena. The location of the two objects was randomly counter-balanced across trials to prevent responding on the basis of location. Exploration was scored as above.     The subjects were first habituated by placing them in the apparatus for two consecutive days for 5 min on each day in the absence of the stimulus objects. A single trial was run on both conditioning and test days. On the conditioning day, identical stimulus objects were placed in symmetrical locations in the open field. The rat was placed in the center of the arena (about 30 cm from the front wall and 45 cm from the side walls) with its nose facing the objects. The rat was allowed to explore the stimuli until it accumulated 30 s total object exploration (i.e., exploration of either object) or until 20 min had passed. Object exploration time was scored only when the rat’s nose was within 1 cm of the object (but not touching it) and the vibrissae moving.     The rat was allowed to explore the stimuli until it accumulated 30 s total object exploration (i.e., exploration of either object) or until 20 min had passed. Object exploration time was scored only when the rat’s nose was within 1 cm of the object (but not touching it) and the vibrissae moving.     The original submitted data was processed by the LBL/UCB Predictive Modeling Project funded by NASA (Senior investigators: Andy Wyrobek, Ana Mora and Ben Brown). Multiple emails were exchanged with Dr. Rabin (original study PI) to clarify any inconsistencies in dates, animal identifiers, and a few behavioral outcome values that were out of range or had been calculated incorrectly. Data sets were formatted so that they could be merged. These files also contain categories that are specific to the predictive modeling parameters used by the LBL/UCB team. For questions regarding the original study data and methods/assays, please contact the original study investigator and publication author Dr. Bernard Rabin (rabin@umbc.edu). For questions about the predictive modeling data files or how they were generated, please contact Dr. Mora (animora@berkeley.edu).     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with an assay data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining. For the original submitted files, animals are separated into two different years based on the year in which they were irradiated at NSRL, but the current study uses subjects from both years.",

          "Study Description": "On long-duration missions to other planets astronauts will be exposed to types and doses of radiation that are not experienced in low earth orbit. Previous research using a ground-based model for exposure to cosmic rays has shown that exposure to heavy particles, such as 56Fe, disrupts spatial learning and memory measured using the Morris water maze. Maintaining rats on diets containing antioxidant phytochemicals for 2 weeks prior to irradiation ameliorated this deficit. The present experiments were designed to determine: (1) the generality of the particle-induced disruption of memory by examining the effects of exposure to 56Fe particles on object recognition memory; and (2) whether maintaining rats on these antioxidant diets for 2 weeks prior to irradiation would also ameliorate any potential deficit. The results showed that exposure to low doses of 56Fe particles does disrupt recognition memory and that maintaining rats on antioxidant diets containing blueberry and strawberry extract for only 2 weeks was effective in ameliorating the disruptive effects of irradiation. The results are discussed in terms of the mechanisms by which exposure to these particles may produce effects on neurocognitive performance. This study derives behavior results from the novel object recognition assay. The original data derived from this study by Rabin et al. was transformed and used as part of a predictive modeling study by Dr. Mora, Dr. Wyrobek, Dr. Ben Brown et al.

To facilitate direct comparison of DIP-Seq data with gene expression data for the 2-week time point, RNA-Seq was used to profile transcription from the same animals used for the DIP-Seq experiments.     Antibodies against 5mC and 5hmC were used to immunoprecipitate sonicated DNA preparations for methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation (meDIP-- anti-5mC mouse mAb, EMD-Millipore NA8; catalog number 162 33 D3) and hydroxymethyl-DNA immunoprecipitation (hmeDIP; anti-5hmC rabbit polyclonal ; catalog number 39769; 2 ul, Active Motif)), respectively, and Dynal anti-mouse IgG beads from pools of tissues. Beads were rinsed 7 times with IP buffer, eluted with 1% SDS at room temperature and the eluted DNA purified. RNAse-treated DNA was sonicated using a Cole Parmer CPX-132 sonicator (75% amplitude, 3 × 10′) and polished using the DNA terminator end repair kit (Lucigen). DNA fragments were A- tailed using Klenow exo- (Epicenter), ligated to un-methylated HT TrueSeq indexed adapters, subjected to limited amplification (~15 cycles), and purified using SPRI beads (Sera-Mag SpeedBeads).     Libraries were sequenced on the HiSeq 2000 platform at the OHSU Massively Parallel Sequencing Shared Resource or the Oregon State University Center for Genome Research.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.     mRNA was isolated using the NEBnext poly A selection kit (New England Biolabs).

Six-month-old C57BL/6J male mice (n equals 84 mice in total) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor Maine. The biological age of the mice was selected to be relevant to the biological age of astronauts during space missions. The mice were shipped from Jackson Laboratories to Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Upton, New York, and allowed to accommodate to the housing facility there for one week. Subsequently, the mice were irradiated with 0.3, 0.6, or 0.9 Gy of 600 MeV 28Si ion or sham-irradiated (n equals 42 mice/radiation dose). For irradiation, mice were individually loaded into 8 x 3 x 3 cm plastic square enclosures with air holes and placed in a foam fixture in the beam line of the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL).  They were exposed to a rectangular beam of approximately 20 x 20 cm. The focused beam of high-energy was generated by the Booster accelerator at BNL and transferred to the experimental beam line at the NSRL facility. Dose calibration was performed so that the desired dose could be delivered.  Sham-irradiated mice were placed into the plastic enclosures for the same time as the irradiated mice. Mice were randomly assigned to the experimental groups. The week after the irradiation or sham-irradiation, the mice were shipped to Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) and cognitive testing started two weeks following irradiation. Following cognitive testing, the mice were killed by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation. The hippocampus of one hemibrain was dissected for DNA methylation and RNAseq analyses. The other hemibrain was processed for Arc mRNA and TET2 immunohistochemical analyses. All protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of OHSU and BNL and were in compliance with all Federal regulations. This study includes data from only four sham-irradiated animals, five animals irradiated with 0.3 Gray Si-28, and four animals irradiated with 0.6 Gray Si-28.  Data from 12 animals were used for bulk RNA-seq, 12 animals for 5hmC DIP-seq, and 10 animals for 5mC DIP-seq.     The hippocampus of one hemibrain was dissected for DNA methylation and RNAseq analyses. The other hemibrain was processed for Arc mRNA and TET2 immunohistochemical analyses. All protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of OHSU and BNL and were in compliance with all Federal regulations. Each RNA-Seq and DIP-Seq library was constructed from a pool of two mouse hippocampi per radiation condition and 3-4 libraries were generated per condition for a total of 12 RNA-Seq libraries, 10 meDIP-Seq libraries, 12 hmcDIP-Seq libraries.",

We assessed the response of the  brain to 28Si ion irradiation (600 MeV/n), a heavy ion present in the  space environment, on cognitive performance and whether the response is  associated with altered DNA methylation in the hippocampus, a brain  area important for cognitive performance. At 0.3 Gy, but not at 0.6 Gy  or 0.9 Gy, 28Si ion irradiation impaired cognition that correlated with  altered gene expression and 5hmC profiles that mapped to specific gene  ontology pathways. Comparing hippocampal DNA hydroxymethylation  following proton, 56Fe ion, and 28Si ion irradiation revealed a general  space radiation synaptic signature with 45 genes that are associated  with profound phenotypes. The most significant categories were  glutamatergic synapse and postsynaptic density. Thus, the brain’s  response to space irradiation involves novel excitatory synapse and  postsynaptic remodeling.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "mHypoE-N38 cells (Cedarlane Lab, Burlington, Canada) were seeded at a density of 1 × 10^5 cells in T25 flasks and cultured in Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, high glucose; Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10 % (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) and 1 % (v/v) of penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) in a humidified 5 % CO2 atmosphere 37 C. The medium was changed routinely every other day. Cells were divided into four groups: a ground condition group (GC; the control group), a proton irradiated group (the space radiation group), a simulated uG group, and a proton irradiated × simulated uG group (the combination group). For each group, cells were prepared in triplicate for each experiment (three T25 flasks per group for each experiment).     T25 flasks (at a density of 1 × 10^5 cells) were irradiated with 1 Gy (Gy) of protons using a 100 MeV proton accelerator (TR102; Korea Multi-Purpose Accelerator Complex, Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, Gyeongju-si, Republic of Korea). Since the effects of exposure were not immediately apparent, cells were subsequently cultured for 3 days, then cell pellets were obtained.     For uG simulation, a gravity controller, Gravite (Space Bio-Laboratories Co., Ltd., Hiroshima, Japan), was used. This patented machine [patent no.: 623009 (JP) and US9494949B2 (US)] creates conditions similar to outer space (10^−3 G) by rotating samples in 3D around two axes (inner and outer shaft), integrating the gravity vector with the temporal axis. That is, uG is simulated at the center of the device when gravity vectors in a spherical space are added up. The machine offers preset rotation speeds with constant speed according to four modes (A to D). In this study, the recommended mode for cell culture (mode C) was used. Note that, real-time simulated uG values are displayed on the machine controller, allowing us to monitor the uG levels generated by the machine. T25 flasks seeded with a cell density of 1 × 10^5 were securely fitted in the center of the machine, exposed to simulated uG for 3 days, and then cell pellets were collected.\n\nTo mimic the combined stress experienced by astronauts during spaceflight, we exposed mHypoE-N38 cells in T25 flasks (cell density 1 × 10^5) to a proton beam first, then, subjecting them to simulated uG for 3 days. This sequence enabled us to investigate how radiation damage and uG interact as the uG effect may diminish during post-irradiation incubation if uG exposure precedes radiation exposure. Same as other conditions, cell pellets were obtained after finishing the exposure to simulated space environment.     Cell pellets were obtained and used to extract RNA for all control and treatment groups.     Total RNA was extracted from cells in 25T flasks, and RNA integrity was confirmed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). DNA contaminants were removed using DNase, and the RNA was then treated with a Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) to isolate the RNA for sequencing.     Isolated and fragmented RNA were used to generate cDNA fragments by reverse transcription. For high-throughput sequencing, libraries were constructed using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Kit with Ribo-Zero Human/Mouse/Rat (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Library qualities and quantities were confirmed using the NovaSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).     Paired-end sequencing was performed using the Illumina platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of Mus-musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 13-May-2024.",

          "Study Description": "Purpose: Space exploration poses unique challenges to astronauts, especially the effects of space radiation and microgravity (uG). Understanding molecular responses to these factors is crucial for ensuring astronaut health, and this study aimed to identify transcriptomic changes in mouse hypothalamic cell line N38 (mHypoE-N38) caused by simulated space environments. Method: Four experimental groups were established, namely, a ground condition group (GC; the control group), a proton irradiated group (the space radiation group), a simulated uG group, and a proton irradiated × simulated uG group (the combination group). RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed to investigate key altered genes and to validate them. Results: Three hundred and fifty-five differentially expressed genes were identified. Notably, the expressions of UCN2 and UGT1A5 genes were upregulated in all three experimental groups, suggesting a shared regulatory mechanism with potential consequences for brain function during space missions. Moreover, the study revealed significant alterations in genes belonging to the USP17 and ZSCAN4 families, indicating active response to DNA damage and telomere maintenance. PCR results validated that UGT1A5, USP17 family, and ZSCAN4 families (ZSCAN4C, ZSCAN4D, and ZSCAN4F) were significantly upregulated at the mRNA level in the combination group, while UCN2, ZSCAN4A, and ZSCAN4B were not reproduced. Conclusion: The present study on mHypoE-N38 cells exposed to space environments revealed a complex molecular narrative with disease-oriented implications. The knowledge gained might serve as a cornerstone for developing strategies to mitigate potential health risks associated with extended exposure to space-related stressors.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "For all subjects, food and water were available ad libitum. Daily health checks and animal husbandry (i.e., cage changing, watering, and feeding) were performed by laboratory personnel. All animals received an ophthalmic examination prior to serving as subjects. Animals with optic defects were excluded from the study. The animals were housed in two conditions, either hind limb suspension or standard vivarium caging. The animals for this study existed in 1 of 4 cohorts. Cohort 1 was composed of young male rats that were 3 months of age. Cohort 2 was composed of young female rats that were 3 months of age. Cohort 3 was composed of male rats that were 9 months of age. Cohort 4 was composed of old male rats that were 9 months of age, and were also exposed to mildly hypercapnic conditions (1% CO2) during the 90 day hindlimb unloading period. During the 90-day recovery period, all of the older male rats were exposed to standard lab air. To expose animals to a hypercapnic environment, cages were placed in a temperature-controlled chamber. Compressed CO2 was added to the input and flow rates adjusted to give a partial pressure of 7.6 torr (1.0% CO2 in air). CO2 level was continuously monitored using a CO2 Meter K-33 ELG Datalogger (CO2Meter, Ormond Beach, FL). For all other cohorts (1-3), the duration of hindlimb unloading exposure was: 0 days (baseline), 7 days, 14 days, 28 days, or 90 days. Reloading (hindlimb unloading + recovery) groups were first exposed to 90 days of hindlimb unloading, and then allowed to recover for 7, 14, 28, or 90 days. Age matched controls were kept in standard laboratory cages with either 1% CO2 or standard lab air. The unloading apparatus consists of two sets of bearings connected by a metal rod and a fifth bearing that rolls along the metal rod; a fish-line swivel is connected to the fifth bearing. The unloading device, located at the top of the cage, rides along two parallel sides of the cage. The pulley system and swivel allow the animal to move easily using its front paws. The body of the rat makes about a 30° angle from the cage floor. The angle and height of the rats are checked, and adjusted if necessary, on a daily basis. The rat is allowed to move freely on an x-y axis and rotate 360° so that it has access to all areas of the cage. Using minimal restraint, the tail is cleaned with alcohol, removing all the dead or dirty skin, then allowed to dry. The tail is then sprayed with a generous amount of adhesive spray and allowed to dry. When the spray is tacky, a strip of traction tape, cut to length and pre-attached to a plastic suspension tab, is attached to the tail beginning at the base of the tail just below the hair line. The traction tape is gently pressed to the tail so that it sticks along the tail's surface. The traction tape is secured to the tail with strips of filament tape (∼0.25 in. wide × 1.5 in. long). One strip is placed around the base of the tail over the ends of the traction tape, and a second strip is added about halfway up the tape. Gauze bandage may be wrapped around the area covered with traction tape tail to protect the traction tape and to deter the rat from peeling off the tape. A line is drawn with a marking pen at the bottom of the traction tape to monitor movement of the tape. The rat is then suspended and the tail suspension tab attached to a fish-line swivel that hangs from the unloading device on top of the hindlimb unloading cage. In addition, a Biospecimen Sharing Program was conducted. Selected tissues were provided to successful applicants to the BSP. Remaining tissues were archived at NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection.     Data was acquired using a biotelemetry system with an implantable transmitter (Data Sciences). The transmitter allowed continuous collection of intracranial pressure (ICP). ICP was measured using a pressure catheter. Core Body Temperature (Tb) was derived from a thermistor in the body of the transmitter. The transmitter was placed subcutaneously between the scapulae via a small midline incision and the EEG and pressure leads routed subcutaneously to the head. Following surgery all incisions were closed and animals were allowed to recover for two weeks prior to serving as subjects. The implants had a magnetic switch which allowed them to be turned off to extend the battery life of the implant.     The transmitter was placed subcutaneously between the scapulae via a small midline incision and the EEG and pressure leads routed subcutaneously to the head. Following surgery all incisions were closed and animals were allowed to recover for two weeks prior to serving as subjects. To accomplish the 6 month recording period, data was collected for 5-6 days at baseline, and every subsequent 30 days during the experiment timeline.     Data was collected using the manufacturer's software.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with an assay data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.     Data was collected using the manufacturer's software.",

          "Study Description": "This ground-based program was intended to address the etiology of visual system structural and functional changes observed in astronauts during both inflight and postflight periods. Using the well-documented rat hindlimb suspension (HLS) model, functionally equivalent to human head-down bedrest, we examined the relationship between cephalic fluid shifts resulting from long-duration G-unloading and the regulation of intracranial and intraocular pressures, as well as the effects these same cephalic fluid shifts have on visual system structure and function. Animals were chronically instrumented with biotelemetry to continuously measure intracranial pressure. Additionally, regular intraocular pressure measurements were made by tonometry during long-term exposure to cephalic fluid shifts induced by suspension. MRI images visualizing the visual system morphology were collected from HLS and control animals at regular intervals. Retinal morphology and ultrastructure were examined at specified intervals both during HLS and post-HLS recovery by ophthalmic examinations. This program utilized both male and female subjects in order to examine possible sex differences in these responses. We also examined the possible contributory factors of aging and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) on these responses of the visual system. Further, in addition to mimicking the effects of long duration exposure to microgravity through the use of the HLS model, we examined the responses of our measured outcomes during long-term recovery in the post-HLS period. Collectively, these data will help  us to develop a model to both understand and predict the etiology of changes in visual structure and function in astronauts exposed to the microgravity of spaceflight and during postflight recovery. This study investigated the development of a translational mammalian model within the context of hindlimb unloading, sex, and aging by which the data generated using this model can facilitate the development of countermeasures to alleviate any visual system decrements arising from exposure to the microgravity spaceflight environment. This study derives results from Biotelemetry (body temperature and intraocular pressure) assay using implants in the subcutaneous tissue and subdural space.

Animals in this study were examined in vivo using MR imaging at the Center for Molecular and Genomic Imaging (CMGI) at UC Davis. The lens, retina and optic nerve of the animals were visualized using the longitudinal magnetic relaxation time (T1) of water, i.e. T1 weighted imaging (T1WI) using a similar sequence protocol to that described in Sun et al. (2011). The imaging sessions took place on the 7T Bruker BioSpec MRI. This MRI is a horizontal bore system is equipped for in vivo small-animal imaging and spectroscopy. Because of the anatomy of the rat’s eye, globe diameters were measured at a 45° angle.The images for this study were acquired using a 72mm volume resonator for transmitting a uniform RF field for proton excitation, and a 4-channel phased array surface coil for superior signal-to-noise in the final image.     These studies utilized both male and female subjects in order to examine possible sex differences in these responses. We also examined the possible contributory factors of aging and atmospheric carbon dioxide (1% CO2) to these responses of the visual system. Further, in addition to mimicking the effects of long-duration exposure to microgravity through the use of the HLS model, we examined the responses of our measured outcomes during long-term recovery in the post-HLS period.     The system utilizes Bruker’s Paravision imaging software, which incorporates all standard, as well as recently developed imaging protocols, that allows sophisticated image processing. Images were analyzed to allow specific visualization/measurement of a variety of optic parameters, including: optic nerve diameter, optic nerve head swelling, optic globe distances between the cornea, lens, and posterior globe, etc.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with an assay data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group.

          "Study Protocol Description": "For all subjects, food and water were available ad libitum. Daily health checks and animal husbandry (i.e., cage changing, watering, and feeding) were performed by laboratory personnel. All animals received an ophthalmic examination prior to serving as subjects. Animals with optic defects were excluded from the study. The animals were housed in two conditions, either hind limb suspension or standard vivarium caging. The animals for this study existed in 1 of 4 cohorts. Cohort 1 was composed of young male rats that were 3 months of age. Cohort 2 was composed of young female rats that were 3 months of age. Cohort 3 was composed of male rats that were 9 months of age. Cohort 4 was composed of old male rats that were 9 months of age, and were also exposed to mildly hypercapnic conditions (1% CO2) during the 90 day hindlimb unloading period. During the 90-day recovery period, all of the older male rats were exposed to standard lab air. To expose animals to a hypercapnic environment, cages were placed in a temperature-controlled chamber. Compressed CO2 was added to the input and flow rates adjusted to give a partial pressure of 7.6 torr (1.0% CO2 in air). CO2 level was continuously monitored using a CO2 Meter K-33 ELG Datalogger (CO2Meter, Ormond Beach, FL). For all other cohorts (1-3), the duration of hindlimb unloading exposure was: 0 days (baseline), 7 days, 14 days, 28 days, or 90 days. Reloading (hindlimb unloading + recovery) groups were first exposed to 90 days of hindlimb unloading, and then allowed to recover for 7, 14, 28, or 90 days. Age matched controls were kept in standard laboratory cages with either 1% CO2 or standard lab air.\n\nThe unloading apparatus consists of two sets of bearings connected by a metal rod and a fifth bearing that rolls along the metal rod; a fish-line swivel is connected to the fifth bearing. The unloading device, located at the top of the cage, rides along two parallel sides of the cage. The pulley system and swivel allow the animal to move easily using its front paws. The body of the rat makes about a 30° angle from the cage floor. The angle and height of the rats are checked, and adjusted if necessary, on a daily basis. The rat is allowed to move freely on an x-y axis and rotate 360° so that it has access to all areas of the cage. Using minimal restraint, the tail is cleaned with alcohol, removing all the dead or dirty skin, then allowed to dry. The tail is then sprayed with a generous amount of adhesive spray and allowed to dry. When the spray is tacky, a strip of traction tape, cut to length and pre-attached to a plastic suspension tab, is attached to the tail beginning at the base of the tail just below the hair line. The traction tape is gently pressed to the tail so that it sticks along the tail's surface. The traction tape is secured to the tail with strips of filament tape (∼0.25 in. wide × 1.5 in. long). One strip is placed around the base of the tail over the ends of the traction tape, and a second strip is added about halfway up the tape. Gauze bandage may be wrapped around the area covered with traction tape tail to protect the traction tape and to deter the rat from peeling off the tape. A line is drawn with a marking pen at the bottom of the traction tape to monitor movement of the tape. The rat is then suspended and the tail suspension tab attached to a fish-line swivel that hangs from the unloading device on top of the hindlimb unloading cage. In addition, a Biospecimen Sharing Program was conducted. Selected tissues were provided to successful applicants to the BSP. Remaining tissues were archived at NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection.     Intraocular pressure was measured using tonometry. A Tonolab was applied to the cornea of each eye. The average of 6 consecutive readings was utilized as the IOP for each data sample.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with an assay data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.     All animals received complete ophthalmic examinations prior to inclusion in the study and in conjunction with other ophthalmic measures made. Prior to examination, the eyes were dilated using 1% tropicamide. After dilation was achieved, eyes were examined with a Sonomed device to measure the axial length of the globe by A-scan ultrasonography.     Sonomed device software was used to capture and analyze data.     All animals received complete ophthalmic examinations prior to inclusion in the study and in conjunction with other ophthalmic measures made. Prior to examination, the rats were dilated using 1% tropicamide. After dilation was achieved, OCT of the optic nerve and fundus were done using the Bioptigen spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT). Measurements of retinal and choroid thickness were measured nasal, temporal, and linear of the optic nerve.     Animals in this study were examined in vivo using MR imaging at the Center for Molecular and Genomic Imaging (CMGI) at UC Davis. The lens, retina and optic nerve of the animals were visualized using the longitudinal magnetic relaxation time (T1) of water, i.e. T1 weighted imaging (T1WI) using a similar sequence protocol to that described in Sun et al. (2011). The imaging sessions took place on the 7T Bruker BioSpec MRI. This MRI is a horizontal bore system is equipped for in vivo small-animal imaging and spectroscopy. Because of the anatomy of the rat’s eye, globe diameters were measured at a 45° angle.The images for this study were acquired using a 72mm volume resonator for transmitting a uniform RF field for proton excitation, and a 4-channel phased array surface coil for superior signal-to-noise in the final image.     These studies utilized both male and female subjects in order to examine possible sex differences in these responses. We also examined the possible contributory factors of aging and atmospheric carbon dioxide (1% CO2) to these responses of the visual system. Further, in addition to mimicking the effects of long-duration exposure to microgravity through the use of the HLS model, we examined the responses of our measured outcomes during long-term recovery in the post-HLS period.     The system utilizes Bruker’s Paravision imaging software, which incorporates all standard, as well as recently developed imaging protocols, that allows sophisticated image processing. Images were analyzed to allow specific visualization/measurement of a variety of optic parameters, including: optic nerve diameter, optic nerve head swelling, optic globe distances between the cornea, lens, and posterior globe, etc.",

          "Study Description": "This ground-based program was intended to address the etiology of visual system structural and functional changes observed in astronauts during both inflight and postflight periods. Using the well-documented rat hindlimb suspension (HLS) model, functionally equivalent to human head-down bedrest, we examined the relationship between cephalic fluid shifts resulting from long-duration G-unloading and the regulation of intracranial and intraocular pressures, as well as the effects these same cephalic fluid shifts have on visual system structure and function. Animals were chronically instrumented with biotelemetry to continuously measure intracranial pressure. Additionally, regular intraocular pressure measurements were made by tonometry during long-term exposure to cephalic fluid shifts induced by suspension. MRI images visualizing the visual system morphology were collected from HLS and control animals at regular intervals. Retinal morphology and ultrastructure were examined at specified intervals both during HLS and post-HLS recovery by ophthalmic examinations. This program utilized both male and female subjects in order to examine possible sex differences in these responses. We also examined the possible contributory factors of aging and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) on these responses of the visual system. Further, in addition to mimicking the effects of long duration exposure to microgravity through the use of the HLS model, we examined the responses of our measured outcomes during long-term recovery in the post-HLS period. Collectively, these data will help  us to develop a model to both understand and predict the etiology of changes in visual structure and function in astronauts exposed to the microgravity of spaceflight and during postflight recovery. This study investigated the development of a translational mammalian model within the context of hindlimb unloading, sex, and aging by which the data generated using this model can facilitate the development of countermeasures to alleviate any visual system decrements arising from exposure to the microgravity spaceflight environment. This study derives results from Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Optical Coherence Tomography, Tonometry, and A-scan Ultrasonography assays using eye tissues. This study is related to results found in OSD-680 (optic nerve) and OSD-681(subcutaneous tissue and subdural space).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Male and female C57Bl6/J wild-type 24-week-old mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and the National Institute on Aging and directly delivered to BNL. Animals underwent simplified five-ion GCRsim exposure at the NSRL. Following GCRsim exposure, animals were transported to UCSF for behavioral and cellular analysis. At UCSF, animals were housed on a reverse light cycle and environmentally controlled conditions (12:12-hour light:dark cycle at 21 +/- 1 degrees C; 50% humidity) all had access to food and water ad libitum. When aggressors were identified, they were individually housed with extra enrichment. Chlorhexidine Flush 0.2% Solution (Ceva, Lenexa, KS) was used to treat any wounding that occurred. Mice in which wounding persisted were excluded from analysis. Limited alterations in health states were measured across multiple cohorts and groups with no significant differences due to sex, diet, or GCRsim exposure. Male and female mice were housed in the same room in groups of one, two, three, or four. Estrous cycles were not monitored. Seven days after GCRsim exposure (days 8 to 23 after exposure), mice were switched to PLX5622–1200 ppm (PLX) or normal chow (control diet) for 15 days. The PLX diet was composed of a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1-R) inhibitor that depleted microglia within 3 days (~90%) and sustained the depleted state throughout the duration of the 15-day treatment. Upon returning to a normal diet, microglia repopulation occurs within 7 days.     Following 1 week of acclimation at BNL, mice were then irradiated at the NSRL using the NASA-approved simplified GCRsim protocol. Five charged particle species delivered in rapid succession to simulate the space radiation spectrum expected inside a deep space vehicle with self-shielding by the human body. These particles were, in order of delivery, 1000 MeV/n protons [linear energy transfer (LET) 0.20 keV/mm], 600 MeV/n silicon ions (LET 50.4 keV/mm), 250 MeV/n helium ions (LET 1.60 keV/mm), 350 MeV/n oxygen ions (LET 20.9 keV/mm), and 250 MeV/n protons (LET 0.40 keV/mm), in dose proportions of 35% protons (1000 MeV):1% silicon:18% helium, 6% oxygen, 1% iron, and 39% protons (250 MeV). Total doses of 50 cGy were delivered as part of campaigns NSRL 18B, NSRL 19A, and NSRL 19C. At BNL, animals were housed in groups of four on a normal 12:12 light cycle and transported to the NSRL many hours before GCRsim exposure. Several hours after irradiation, animals were returned to the animal care facility. During each exposure, mice were loaded into 7.3 cm by 4.0 cm by 4.0 cm polystyrene restraint boxes with air holes and mounted on the beam line in cutouts in a standard foam holder. The irradiation time was during the light phase of the circadian cycle. The beam spot size was either 20 cm by 20 cm or 60 cm by 60 cm, and animals were placed in the center of the field to assure best uniformity. Over the three NSRL campaigns, the measured doses for the eight 50 cGy exposures were 50.039 +/- 0.023 cGy delivered over 15.87 min for 20 cm by 20 cm beams or 46.12 min for the 60 cm by 60 cm beams, yielding dose rates of 3.17 cGy/min or 1.09 cGy/min, respectively. The measured proportions of individual ions were as described above, and the maximum deviation from the desired dose contribution was 3% (i.e., 1.03% delivered dose versus 1.00% requested dose) in the case of iron ions. After irradiation, the animals were returned to their home cages and returned to the animal care facility for shipment to UCSF by World Courier within 5 days. NSRL GCR and SPE simulations are designed to approximate the chronic mixed field exposures in space by means of sequential acute exposures to a variety of ion/energy combinations. The exposure protocols are on the NSRL website: https://www.bnl.gov/nsrl/userguide/simgcrsim.php (SimGCRSim). The dose can be administered either in a single series of exposures lasting approximately an hour or in daily fractions over several weeks. The GCR simulations are described in detail here: Simonsen LC, Slaba TC, Guida P, Rusek A (2020) NASA’s first ground-based Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: Enabling a new era in space radiobiology research. PLoS Biol 18(5): e3000669. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000669     Seven days after GCRsim exposure, upon arrival at UCSF, blood was collected via the tail vein puncture in awake animals. Using a restrainer, a small nick was made in the tail vein using a scalpel\nand ~50 microliter of blood was removed using a pipette and placed in a tube containing EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich). Blood was used to measure acute changes in peripheral blood biomarkers. After the completion of behavior assays at 12 months, animals were lethally overdosed using a mixture of ketamine (10 mg/ml) and xylazine (1 mg/ml). Once animals were completely anesthetized, the chest cavity was opened and blood was collected via cardiac puncture. Mice were perfused with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) (Gibco) until the liver was clear (∼1 to 2 min).     A LSR II BD Biosciences Flow Cytometer used RBC Lysis BD Biosciences flow solution to perform the flow cytometry assay.     Conjugated antibodies were used to identify CD45, Ly6G, CD8, CD4,  and CD11b monocytes.     To assess circulating leukocyte populations, blood was aliquoted into tubes and stained with surface antibodies for 30 to 60 min at room temperature (18). Surface antibodies included anti-CD45 [fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–conjugated; BD Biosciences], Ly6G [phycoerythrin (PE)–conjugated; BD Biosciences], CD8 (PE-Cy7–conjugated; BD Biosciences), CD4 [allophycocyanin (APC)–conjugated; BD Biosciences], and CD11b (APC-Cy7–conjugated; BD Biosciences). Leukocyte subpopulations were identified as follows: forward and side scatter was used to exclude debris and\ndoublet populations. Specific T cell populations were identified as follows: CD4 T cell subsets were CD4+, CD45+, Ly6G−, CD8−, CD11b−. CD8 T cell subsets were CD8+, CD45+, Ly6G−, CD4−,\nCD11b−. Monocytes were CD11b+, CD45+, Ly6G−, CD4−, CD8−. After surface antibody staining, red blood cells were lysed with RBC lysis (BD Biosciences). Data were collected on LSRII (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo software (v10, Tree Star Inc.).     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with an assay data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures).

Exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) is a major obstacle for deep space travel. Using multivariate principal components analysis, we found sex dimorphic responses in mice exposed to accelerated charged particles to simulate GCR (GCRsim); males displayed impaired spatial learning, whereas females did not. Mechanistically, these GCRsim induced learning impairments corresponded with chronic microglia activation and synaptic alterations in the hippocampus. Temporary microglia depletion shortly after GCRsim exposure mitigated GCRsim induced deficits measured months after the radiation exposure. Furthermore, blood monocyte levels measured early after GCRsim exposure were predictive of the late learning deficits and microglia activation measured in the male mice. Our findings (i) advance our understanding of charged particle induced cognitive challenges, (ii) provide evidence for early peripheral biomarkers for identifying late cognitive deficits, and (iii) offer potential therapeutic strategies for mitigating GCR induced cognitive loss. This study derives results from the Flow Cytometry assay using blood. These data are related to OSD-479 (behavior assays), OSD-777 (Microglia), and OSD-778 (Synapse).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Male and female C57Bl6/J wild-type 24-week-old mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and the National Institute on Aging and directly delivered to BNL. Animals underwent simplified five-ion GCRsim exposure at the NSRL. Following GCRsim exposure, animals were transported to UCSF for behavioral and cellular analysis. At UCSF, animals were housed on a reverse light cycle and environmentally controlled conditions (12:12-hour light:dark cycle at 21 +/- 1 degrees C; 50% humidity) all had access to food and water ad libitum. When aggressors were identified, they were individually housed with extra enrichment. Chlorhexidine Flush 0.2% Solution (Ceva, Lenexa, KS) was used to treat any wounding that occurred. Mice in which wounding persisted were excluded from analysis. Limited alterations in health states were measured across multiple cohorts and groups with no significant differences due to sex, diet, or GCRsim exposure. Male and female mice were housed in the same room in groups of one, two, three, or four. Estrous cycles were not monitored. Seven days after GCRsim exposure (days 8 to 23 after exposure), mice were switched to PLX5622–1200 ppm (PLX) or normal chow (control diet) for 15 days. The PLX diet was composed of a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1-R) inhibitor that depleted microglia within 3 days (~90%) and sustained the depleted state throughout the duration of the 15-day treatment. Upon returning to a normal diet, microglia repopulation occurs within 7 days.     Following 1 week of acclimation at BNL, mice were then irradiated at the NSRL using the NASA-approved simplified GCRsim protocol. Five charged particle species delivered in rapid succession to simulate the space radiation spectrum expected inside a deep space vehicle with self-shielding by the human body. These particles were, in order of delivery, 1000 MeV/n protons [linear energy transfer (LET) 0.20 keV/mm], 600 MeV/n silicon ions (LET 50.4 keV/mm), 250 MeV/n helium ions (LET 1.60 keV/mm), 350 MeV/n oxygen ions (LET 20.9 keV/mm), and 250 MeV/n protons (LET 0.40 keV/mm), in dose proportions of 35% protons (1000 MeV):1% silicon:18% helium, 6% oxygen, 1% iron, and 39% protons (250 MeV). Total doses of 50 cGy were delivered as part of campaigns NSRL 18B, NSRL 19A, and NSRL 19C. At BNL, animals were housed in groups of four on a normal 12:12 light cycle and transported to the NSRL many hours before GCRsim exposure. Several hours after irradiation, animals were returned to the animal care facility. During each exposure, mice were loaded into 7.3 cm by 4.0 cm by 4.0 cm polystyrene restraint boxes with air holes and mounted on the beam line in cutouts in a standard foam holder. The irradiation time was during the light phase of the circadian cycle. The beam spot size was either 20 cm by 20 cm or 60 cm by 60 cm, and animals were placed in the center of the field to assure best uniformity. Over the three NSRL campaigns, the measured doses for the eight 50 cGy exposures were 50.039 +/- 0.023 cGy delivered over 15.87 min for 20 cm by 20 cm beams or 46.12 min for the 60 cm by 60 cm beams, yielding dose rates of 3.17 cGy/min or 1.09 cGy/min, respectively. The measured proportions of individual ions were as described above, and the maximum deviation from the desired dose contribution was 3% (i.e., 1.03% delivered dose versus 1.00% requested dose) in the case of iron ions. After irradiation, the animals were returned to their home cages and returned to the animal care facility for shipment to UCSF by World Courier within 5 days. NSRL GCR and SPE simulations are designed to approximate the chronic mixed field exposures in space by means of sequential acute exposures to a variety of ion/energy combinations. The exposure protocols are on the NSRL website: https://www.bnl.gov/nsrl/userguide/simgcrsim.php (SimGCRSim). The dose can be administered either in a single series of exposures lasting approximately an hour or in daily fractions over several weeks. The GCR simulations are described in detail here: Simonsen LC, Slaba TC, Guida P, Rusek A (2020) NASA’s first ground-based Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: Enabling a new era in space radiobiology research. PLoS Biol 18(5): e3000669. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000669     Animals were lethally overdosed using a mixture of ketamine (10 mg/ml) and xylazine (1 mg/ml). Once animals were completely anesthetized, the chest cavity was opened. Mice were perfused with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) (Gibco) until the liver was clear (∼1 to 2 min). Following PBS perfusion, the whole brain was quickly removed, and one hemisphere was immediately processed for microglia counts by flow cytometry.     An Aria III BD Biosciences Flow Cytometer, with ACS Buffer of 1x Dulbecco's PBS with 0.5% bovine serum albumin fraction V flow solution, was used to perform the flow cytometry assay.     Cells were with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies on ice (CD11b-AF700, 1:100 and CD45-FITC, 1:50, 557690 and 553080, BD Pharmingen; C5aR-PE, 1:100, 130-106-174, Miltenyi Biotec). For intracellular staining, cells were stained with intracellular markers  (CD107a-PE, 1:200, 130-102-219, Miltenyi Biotec; CD206-PE, 1:50, 141706, BioLegend).     Cells were stained for 30 min with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies on ice (CD11b-AF700, 1:100 and CD45-FITC, 1:50, 557690 and 553080, BD Pharmingen; C5aR-PE, 1:100, 130-106-174, Miltenyi Biotec). For intracellular staining, cells prestained with extracellular markers were fixed in 500 microliters of fixation/ permeabilization solution (554714, BD Biosciences) on ice for 15 min, washed twice with 1 × perm/wash buffer (554714, BD Biosciences), and stained with intracellular markers on ice for 30 min (CD107a-PE,1:200, 130-102-219, Miltenyi Biotec; CD206-PE, 1:50, 141706, BioLegend). Stained cells were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer before analyses. Data were collected using an Aria III sorter (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo software (v10, Tree Star Inc.).     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with an assay data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Male and female C57Bl6/J wild-type 24-week-old mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and the National Institute on Aging and directly delivered to BNL. Animals underwent simplified five-ion GCRsim exposure at the NSRL. Following GCRsim exposure, animals were transported to UCSF for behavioral and cellular analysis. At UCSF, animals were housed on a reverse light cycle and environmentally controlled conditions (12:12-hour light:dark cycle at 21 +/- 1 degrees C;  50% humidity) all had access to food and water ad libitum. When aggressors were identified, they were individually housed with extra enrichment. Chlorhexidine Flush 0.2% Solution (Ceva, Lenexa, KS) was used to treat any wounding that occurred. Mice in which wounding persisted were excluded from analysis. Limited alterations in health states were measured across multiple cohorts and groups with no significant differences due to sex, diet, or GCRsim exposure. Male and female mice were housed in the same room in groups of one, two, three, or four. Estrous cycles were not monitored. Seven days after GCRsim exposure (days 8 to 23 after exposure), mice were switched to PLX5622–1200 ppm (PLX) or normal chow (control diet) for 15 days. The PLX diet was composed of a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1-R) inhibitor that depleted microglia within 3 days (~90%) and sustained the depleted state throughout the duration of the 15-day treatment. Upon returning to a normal diet, microglia repopulation occurs within 7 days.     Following 1 week of acclimation at BNL, mice were then irradiated at the NSRL using the NASA-approved simplified GCRsim protocol. Five charged particle species delivered in rapid succession to simulate the space radiation spectrum expected inside a deep space vehicle with self-shielding by the human body. These particles were, in order of delivery, 1000 MeV/n protons [linear energy transfer (LET) 0.20 keV/mm], 600 MeV/n silicon ions (LET 50.4 keV/mm), 250 MeV/n helium ions (LET 1.60 keV/mm), 350 MeV/n oxygen ions (LET 20.9 keV/mm), and 250 MeV/n protons (LET 0.40 keV/mm), in dose proportions of 35% protons (1000 MeV):1% silicon:18% helium, 6% oxygen, 1% iron, and 39% protons (250 MeV). Total doses of 25 cGy were delivered as part of experimental campaign NSRL 19A, 50 cGy were delivered as part of campaigns NSRL 18B, NSRL 19A, and NSRL 19C, 75 cGy doses were delivered as part of campaign NSRL 19A, and 100 cGy doses were delivered as part of campaign NSRL 19A. At BNL, animals were housed in groups of four on a normal 12:12 light cycle and transported to the NSRL many hours before GCRsim exposure. Several hours after irradiation, animals were returned to the animal care facility. During each exposure, mice were loaded into 7.3 cm by 4.0 cm by 4.0 cm polystyrene restraint boxes with air holes and mounted on the beam line in cutouts in a standard foam holder. The irradiation time was during the light phase of the circadian cycle. The beam spot size was either 20 cm by 20 cm or 60 cm by 60 cm, and animals were placed in the center of the field to assure best uniformity. Over the three NSRL campaigns, the measured doses for the eight 50 cGy exposures were 50.039 +/- 0.023 cGy delivered over 15.87 min for 20 cm by 20 cm beams or 46.12 min for the 60 cm by 60 cm beams, yielding dose rates of 3.17 cGy/min or 1.09 cGy/min, respectively. For the two 100 cGy exposures, the measured doses were 100.003 +/- 0.002 cGy delivered over an average of 133.2 min for a dose rate of 0.75 cGy/min. The measured proportions of individual ions were as described above, and the maximum deviation from the desired dose contribution was 3% (i.e., 1.03% delivered dose versus 1.00% requested dose) in the case of iron ions. After irradiation, the animals were returned to their home cages and returned to the animal care facility for shipment to UCSF by World Courier within 5 days.\n\nNSRL GCR and SPE simulations are designed to approximate the chronic mixed field exposures in space by means of sequential acute exposures to a variety of ion/energy combinations. The exposure protocols are on the NSRL website: https://www.bnl.gov/nsrl/userguide/simgcrsim.php (SimGCRSim). The dose can be administered either in a single series of exposures lasting approximately an hour or in daily fractions over several weeks. The GCR simulations are described in detail here: Simonsen LC, Slaba TC, Guida P, Rusek A (2020) NASA’s first ground-based Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: Enabling a new era in space radiobiology research. PLoS Biol 18(5): e3000669. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000669     Following GCRsim exposure, animals were transported to UCSF for behavioral and cellular analysis.     At both 1.5 and 6 months after GCRsim exposure, the EPM was used to evaluate anxiety-like behavior.     At UCSF, animals were housed on a reverse light cycle and environmentally controlled conditions (12:12-hour light:dark cycle at 21 +/- 1 degree C; 50% humidity). Animals were handled to habituate to investigators and room settings for 1 week before testing. Behavioral assays were performed in dark rooms under red lighting during the animals' wake cycle. All behavioral equipment was cleaned with 70% ethanol cleaning solution between each animal. Bright white lights were used to illuminate the open arms of the EPM.     The EPM apparatus contains two exposed open arms (35 cm) opposite each other and two enclosed arms (30.5 cm) also across from one another. Bright white lights were used to illuminate the open arms. The arms were attached at a center platform (4.5 cm2) creating the plus shape. The entire apparatus was elevated 40 cm off the floor.     Individual mice were placed onto the center of the maze and allowed to explore the maze for 5 min while their activity was recorded.     All behavioral assays were recorded using an overhead camera connected to a video tracking and analysis system (EthoVision XT 12.0, Noldus Information Technology). A combination of EthoVision software analysis and scoring manually by two investigators blinded to GCRsim and treatment was used for analysis. A subset of videos was scored by EthoVision and manually scored for cross-validation to ensure reliability between computer analysis and manual scoring. All behavioral analysis was performed by one male and four female investigators blinded to the irradiation group. Animals were randomized by sex and group over the testing period. No differences between investigators, time of day, or testing window were observed. Significant group outliers, software issues, animals that did not perform the task, and animals that died or no longer had whiskers were excluded from analysis. For the EPM, the time in the open arm + center was measured (in seconds).     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with an assay data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.     The NOR assay was used at both ~3 to 4 months and 6 months after exposure to measure hippocampal-dependent memory function.     At UCSF, animals were housed on a reverse light cycle and environmentally controlled conditions (12:12-hour light:dark cycle at 21 +/- 1 degree C; 50% humidity). Animals were handled to habituate to investigators and room settings for 1 week before testing. Behavioral assays were performed in dark rooms under red lighting during the animals' wake cycle. All behavioral equipment was cleaned with 70% ethanol cleaning solution between each animal.     A 30 cm by 30 cm by 30 cm arena was used under red lighting for all phases of NOR testing. On day 3, two identical objects (Duplo red blocks) were secured to the bottom of the arena with magnets in opposite corners (training phase). On day 4, one of the identical objects was replaced by a novel object (Duplo orange flower) of similar size and texture (testing phase).     On the first 2 days of the NOR, animals freely explored the arena for 10 min per day (habituation phase). On day 3, two identical objects (Duplo red blocks) were secured to the bottom of the arena with magnets in opposite corners (training phase). Mice were given 5 min to freely explore the objects. On day 4, one of the identical objects was replaced by a novel object (Duplo orange flower) of similar size and texture (testing phase). Mice were given 5 min to freely explore the objects.     For Novel Object Recognition, trials were recorded, and exploratory behavior was defined as time the animals spent directing its nose toward an object. Data are expressed as percent of time mice spent exploring each object. Mice that had less than 5 s of exploration time during either training or testing were excluded from analysis. Calculated readouts for NOR included (for the first 3 and 5 min of testing) (i) interaction time with novel object (%) equals ((time of nose interaction with novel object)/(total time of nose interaction with novel object + familiar object)) times 100, (ii) interaction time with familiar object (%) equals ((time of nose interaction with familiar object)/(total time of nose interaction with novel object + familiar object)) times 100, and (iii) discrimination index equals (time of nose interaction with novel object minus time of nose interaction with familiar object)/(total time of nose interaction with novel object + familiar object).     Anxiety-like behavior was later measured by the open-field test at ~3 and 6 months after GCRsim exposure.     At UCSF, animals were housed on a reverse light cycle and environmentally controlled conditions (12:12-hour light:dark cycle at 21 +/- 1 degree C; 50% humidity). Animals were handled to habituate to investigators and room settings for 1 week before testing. Behavioral assays were performed in dark rooms under red lighting during the animals' wake cycle. All behavioral equipment was cleaned with 70% ethanol cleaning solution between each animal.     The open field arena was 30 cm by 30 cm lit under red lighting.     For this task, animals were allowed to freely explore an open-field arena (30 cm by 30 cm) for 10 min under red lighting.     For the open field, anxiety-like behavior was calculated by alterations in time spent (in seconds) in the center (17 cm by 17 cm) of the arena.     The RAWM was used ~5 to 5.5 and 6 to 6.5 months after GCRsim to test spatial learning.     At UCSF, animals were housed on a reverse light cycle and environmentally controlled conditions (12:12-hour light:dark cycle at 21 +/- 1 degree C; 50% humidity). Animals were handled to habituate to investigators and room settings for 1 week before testing. Behavioral assays were performed in dark rooms under red lighting during the animals' wake cycle. All behavioral equipment was cleaned with 70% ethanol cleaning solution between each animal.     The maze was a circular pool with a diameter of 118.5 cm and eight arms of 41 cm each in length. The pool was filled with water, and nontoxic white paint (54-2128-053, Crayola) was added to make the water opaque. An escape platform was placed at the end of one of the arms just below the surface of the water and hidden from view throughout the entire assay. Visual cues were placed around the room.     Animals ran three consecutive 60-s trials with a 10-min intertrial interval. Animals were placed in an arm, not containing the escape platform, during each trial. The starting arm was changed each trial. If the animal successfully located the escape platform, they remained for 10 s and were then returned to the holding cage. If the animal was unable to locate the platform, the experimenter guided the animal to the escape platform, where they remained for 10 s before returning to the holding cage.     On the Radial Arm Water Maze, the number of errors (entry into an arm without the escape platform) was determined using EthoVision software. The number of errors in trials 1 to 3 was averaged to calculate the day average.     The three-chamber social approach task was used to test sociability and social memory ~2 to 3 months after GCRsim exposure.     At UCSF, animals were housed on a reverse light cycle and environmentally controlled conditions (12:12-hour light:dark cycle at 21 +/- 1 degree C; 50% humidity). Animals were handled to habituate to investigators and room settings for 1 week before testing. Behavioral assays were performed in dark rooms under red lighting during the animals' wake cycle. All behavioral equipment was cleaned with 70% ethanol cleaning solution between each animal.     Individual animals were placed into a three-chamber arena (72 cm by 50 cm; each chamber is 24 cm by 50 cm) in a dark room under red light. During the habituation phase, no cages or conspecifics were present in the arena. In the sociability phase, an empty cage (10 cm in diameter) was placed into one chamber of the arena, and on the opposite side, a stranger age- and sex-matched mouse (conspecific) was placed into a cage. Cages were approximately 30 cm apart. During the social memory phase, a novel (sex- and age-matched) mouse was placed in the previously empty cage from the sociability phase set up.     Behavior was recorded through three consecutive stages: habituation, sociability, and social memory. The habituation phase consisted of 10 min of free exploration. In the sociability phase, animals were allowed to freely explore the arena for 10 min. Placement of a stranger mouse into the right or left chamber was alternated for each trial. The social memory phase was conducted immediately following the sociability phase and the experimental mouse interaction was measured for 5 min. Stranger/novel mice consisted of two cages (four mice per cage) of nonaggressive, sex- and age-matched non- littermate mice. Investigators took extreme caution during testing to avoid odor mixing during testing (cleaning, changing gloves, etc.). All four mice were used in all groups, and no aversions were noted.     On the three-chamber social interaction task, the experimental animal's sociability was measured by their preference for interaction with the mouse rather than the empty cage during the sociability phase. Interaction was determined as the nose point of the mouse in close proximity (less than 5 mm) from the respective cage. Social memory was measured by the subject's preference for the novel mouse over the familiar mouse encountered during the sociability phase. Calculated readouts for sociability included (for the first 3 and 5 min of testing) (i) interaction time with mouse (seconds), (ii) interaction time with mouse (%) equals ((time of nose interaction with mouse)/(total time of nose interaction with mouse + empty cage)) times 100, (iii) interaction time with empty cage equals ((time of nose interaction with empty cage)/(total time of nose interaction with mouse + empty cage)) times 100, and (iv) sociability ratio equals (interaction time with mouse (%))/(interaction time with empty cage (%)). Significant group outliers, software issues, and animals that died or no longer had whiskers were excluded from analysis. Calculated readouts for social memory included (for the first 3 and 5 min of testing) (i) interaction time with mouse (seconds), (ii) interaction time with mouse (%) equals ((time of nose interaction with novel mouse)/(total time of nose interaction with novel mouse + familiar mouse)) times 100, (iii) interaction time with familiar mouse equals ((time of nose interaction with familiar mouse)/(total time of nose interaction with novel mouse + familiar mouse)) times 100, and (iv) social memory ratio equals (interaction time with novel mouse (%))/(inter- action time with familiar mouse (%)).",

          "Study Description": "In the coming decade, astronauts will travel back to the moon in preparation for future Mars missions. Exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) is a major obstacle for deep space travel. Using multivariate principal components analysis, we found sex dimorphic responses in mice exposed to accelerated charged particles to simulate GCR (GCRsim); males displayed impaired spatial learning, whereas females did not. Mechanistically, these GCRsim induced learning impairments corresponded with chronic microglia activation and synaptic alterations in the hippocampus. Temporary microglia depletion shortly after GCRsim exposure mitigated GCRsim induced deficits measured months after the radiation exposure. Furthermore, blood monocyte levels measured early after GCRsim exposure were predictive of the late learning deficits and microglia activation measured in the male mice. Our findings (i) advance our understanding of charged particle induced cognitive challenges, (ii) provide evidence for early peripheral biomarkers for identifying late cognitive deficits, and (iii) offer potential therapeutic strategies for mitigating GCR induced cognitive loss. This study derives results from the behavior assays Elevated Plus Maze, Novel Object Recognition, Open Field, Radial Arm Water Maze, and Three Chamber Social Isolation/Interaction. These data are related to the Flow Cytometry data in OSD-776 (blood), OSD-777 (Microglia), and OSD-778 (Synapse).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Generation of a muscle-specific Zfp697 knockout mouse model: Floxed mice for the conditional deletion of the Zfp697 gene were generated on a C57bl6/N background by Biocytogen (USA), using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologydirected repair. Briefly, loxP sites were inserted in the intronic region upstream of exon 3 and within the 3´UTR region of exon 3. To minimize the possibility of disrupting Zfp697 expression, both loxP sites were inserted into regions of the gene with low sequence conservation between species. Genomic DNA was extracted from F1 pups and southern blot was used to screen out animals with random insertions. Muscle-specific Zfp697 knockouts (Zfp697-mKO) were generated by crossing Zfp697 floxed mice with animals expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the 1.5-kb Myog promoter and the 1-kb Mef2c enhancer (Myo-Cre; a generous gift from R. Bassel-Duby and E.N. Olson, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, USA). The resulting Zfp697-mKO mice are therefore on a C57bl6/NJ background. Primers for genotyping Zfp697 floxed allele were the following: 5´loxP forward, 5´-TCTGGGACCTGATGAGTCCTACTGG-3´; 5´loxP reverse, 5´-ACGGAGGATAGCCCTTTCTTCCTCA. Hindlimb unloading and reloading: 8-week-old female Zfp697-mKO mice and flox littermates were assigned to three main groups: control, hindlimb unloading or hindlimb reloading. For the hindlimb unloading phase, mice were slightly suspended by tail for the specified number of days, up to 10 days. Briefly, mice were placed inside a restrainer and, using hypoallergenic medical tape, a nylon line was attached in a helical pattern around the base of the tail. The line was connected to a small swivel keychain with metal rings that were attached to a rod running the length of the cage (GR900, Tecniplast). To prevent their hind legs from carrying any weight, the hindlimbs were kept just off the ground with the mouse’s body at an approximately 30-degree angle. Mice were able to move freely on the y-axis, rotate 360-degree using their forelegs, and had access to one side of the cage with food and water ad libitum. Mice were housed in pairs during the unloading phase. The reloading phase consisted of 10 days of hindlimb unloading, after which the animals were returned to normal ambulation in conventional cages for the specified number of days. Control mice were kept in conventional cages throughout the entire protocol with food and water ad libitum. All experiments were approved by the regional animal ethics committee of Northern Stockholm, Sweden.     All tissues were collected, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 C until analysis. All experiments were approved by the regional animal ethics committee of Northern Stockholm, Sweden.     Total RNA was extracted from gastrocnemius muscles of mice using TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) as per the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was purified and treated with DNase using NucleoSpin RNA II columns (Machery Nagel) to remove any remaining DNA contaminants. RNA integrity was verified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer, with all samples showing RNA integrity number (RIN) greater than 8.     Stranded mRNA Library Preparation Kit was used with a polyA-enrichment strategy to prepare the sequencing libraries.     RNA-sequencing was performed by the University of Chicago Genomics Facility (Chicago, USA) using the Illumina NovaSeq, generating 100-bp paired-end reads.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of Mus-musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 09-May-2025.",

          "Study Description": "Muscle atrophy is a morbidity and mortality risk factor that happens with disuse, chronic disease, and ageing. Recovery from atrophy involves changes in protein synthesis and different cell types such as muscle fibers, and satellite and immune cells. Here we show that the previously uncharacterized gene and protein Zfp697 is a damage-induced regulator of muscle regeneration. Zfp697/ZNF697 expression is transiently elevated during recovery from muscle atrophy or injury in mice and humans. Sustained Zfp697 expression in mouse muscle leads to a gene expression signature of chemokine secretion, immune cell recruitment, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Myofiber-specific Zfp697 ablation hinders the inflammatory and regenerative response to muscle injury, compromising functional recovery. We uncover Zfp697 as an essential mediator of the interferon gamma response in muscle cells that functions primarily as an ncRNA-binding protein, most notably the pro-regenerative miR-206. This work identifies Zfp697 as an integrator of cell-cell communication necessary for tissue regeneration.

Sixty C57Bl/6J mice (30 males, 30 females) from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were used in this study. We exposed 3-month-old male and female age-matched C57Bl/6J wild-type (WT) mice to 100 cGy, 0.662 MeV of 137Cs-gamma-IR ((20 animals, male/female: 10/10), 50 cGy 500 MeV/nucleon simGCRsim-IR (20 animals, male/female: 10/10), whereas control mice (20 animals, male/female: 10/10) were not irradiated. The radiation doses were recommended by the Space Radiation Element (SRE) of NASA’s Human Research Program (HRP) based on the SRE programmatic requirements. Animals were housed in groups of 4–5 per microisolator cage, with water and food ad libitum. Both control non-irradiated (Sham) and irradiated mice were fed commercial mouse chow, referred to as Normal Diet (ND). The animal room was kept at a 12:12 h light-dark cycle at 20–22 °C with 30–70% relative humidity. Animals were monitored at least once a day for any physical or behavioral changes that might indicate distress, discomfort, pain, or injury. Only mice showing general signs of poor health and distress (e.g., rapid heart/respiratory rate, oral/nasal discharge, wound dehiscence, marked swelling, ulcerating neoplasms greater than 2 cm or ulcerating, inability to eat/drink, or weight loss greater than 15%) were immediately euthanized using 100% CO2 at 20% air replacement per minute rate, followed by cervical dislocation. Animals found spontaneously dead in their cages were grossly examined, and their carcasses were frozen.  NSRL GCR and SPE simulations are designed to approximate the chronic mixed field exposures in space by means of sequential acute exposures to a variety of ion/energy combinations.  The exposure protocols are on the NSRL website: https://www.bnl.gov/nsrl/userguide/simgcrsim.php (SimGCRSim).  The dose can be administered either in a single series of exposures lasting approximately an hour or in daily fractions over several weeks.  The GCR simulations are described in detail here: Simonsen LC, Slaba TC, Guida P, Rusek A (2020) NASA’s first ground-based Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: Enabling a new era in space radiobiology research. PLoS Biol 18(5): e3000669. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000669. Cesium-137 produces gamma rays with an energy of 0.662 MeV and has a half-life of 30.1 years. Ionizing radiation energy values were added by GeneLab.     In this study, mice were euthanized via exsanguination at 440/440, and 660/550 (male/female) days after irradiation. Fresh snap-frozen LV tissues from male and female mice were collected at 440 and 660/550 days from control, 100 cGy gamma and simGCRsim 50 cGy (5/group, respectively), and stored at -80 °C until further use. All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines.     Total RNA was extracted from LV tissues using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and stored at -80°C until further use. The samples from the sham-irradiated animals are shared in OSD-825.     A poly-A selected mRNA library was prepared using the NEBNextUltra™II RNA Library Prep Kit.     The sequencing was performed on the Illumina NovaSeq-6000 platform to collect an average of 48 million 2 × 150 bp paired-end reads per sample.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1.

We reported heart failure with preserved ejection fraction like cardiac phenotype 660-days following exposure to a single-dose of a simplified galactic cosmic ray simulation (simGCRsim) only in males with functional and structural impairment in left ventricular (LV) function. This sex-based dichotomy prompted us to investigate sex-specific changes in the LV transcriptome in three-month-old male and female mice exposed to 137Cs-gamma- or simGCRsim-IR. Non-IR male and female (10 each) mice served as controls. LVs were collected at 440/660- and 440/550-days post-IR, male and female, respectively. RNA sequencing, differential gene expression, and functional annotation were performed on tissues from 5 mice/group. Sex and post-IR time points had the greatest influence on gene expression, surpassing the IR-type effects. SimGCRsim-IR showed more persistent transcriptome changes than gamma-IR. We suggest that the single IR effects can persist up to 550–660 days, with overwhelmingly sex-biased responses at individual gene expression level.",

For RNA sequencing studies, the WD-fed group (n equals 20, male/female:10/10, randomly selected) was fed a custom Teklad diet containing 42% fat (TD.88137, https://insights.envigo.com/hubfs/resources/data-sheets/88137.pdf) (Envigo, Madison, WI) for 125 days from ages 300 to 425 days (mice were 90 days old when purchased from Jackson Labs and arrived to our vivarium). Our selection was based on a life phase equivalence of 300–420 days for mice, corresponding to 38–47 years for humans. Likewise, for RNA sequencing, the Normal diet (ND)-fed (n equals 20, male/female:10/10, randomly selected) mice served as negative controls and were fed a standard chow diet ad libitum. Please note that experiment was started with a larger number of mice for both sexes and diets, but 10 mice per sex/treatment group were used for longitudinal echocardiography studies, and a different set of 5 mice per sex/treatment group was used for RNA sequencing studies at each timepoint.

          "Study Protocol Description": "All animal experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) protocol number 516. All experiments were performed by trained personnel in AAALAC accredited animal facilities at BNL, while conforming to the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. This study is reported in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines. 24-week-old C57Bl/6J male and female mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (CA, USA) and shipped to Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) 14-days prior to irradiation (IR-14). At arrival to BNL, mice were quarantined and acclimated to a 12h light : 12h dark cycle at standard temperature (23±2°C) and humidity (approximately 50%). Food and water were given ad libitum, and bedding was changed weekly. At IR-4, mice were socially isolated, and, at IR+0, mice irradiated with the 5-ion galactic cosmic ray radiation (GCRsim) at 0, 15, and 50 cGy doses. On day IR-1, mice were transferred to the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) on BNL’s campus by animal care staff. On day IR+0, mice received whole-body irradiation using the simplified 5-ion GCRsim irradiation scheme (protons at 250 and 1000 MeV, 28Si at 600 MeV/n, 4He at 250 MeV/n, 16O at 350 MeV/n, and 56Fe at 600 MeV/n) with 15 and 50 cGy, while 0 cGy sham controls were also performed in similar housing condition, in the absence of irradiation. GCRsim ions, energies, and doses were determined by a NASA consensus formula as previously described. Beam time exposures ranged from ~15 minutes (15 cGy) to 35-45 minutes (50 cGy) per n equals 12 batched cohorts. NSRL GCR and SPE simulations are designed to approximate the chronic mixed field exposures in space by means of sequential acute exposures to a variety of ion/energy combinations.  The exposure protocols are on the NSRL website: https://www.bnl.gov/nsrl/userguide/simgcrsim.php (SimGCRSim).  The dose can be administered either in a single series of exposures lasting approximately an hour or in daily fractions over several weeks.  The GCR simulations are described in detail here: Simonsen LC, Slaba TC, Guida P, Rusek A (2020) NASA’s first ground-based Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: Enabling a new era in space radiobiology research. PLoS Biol 18(5): e3000669. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000669. There are only 0cGy and 50 cGy samples in this dataset.     At IR+14 mice were euthanized by CO2 overdose. Mice were weighed at euthanasia. Blood was collected through the abdominal aorta (11:00–16:00 h).     Total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Thermo Fisher) and purified using Quick-RNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research).     RNA-sequencing libraries were performed using Illumina’s total RNA kit per manufacturer’s instructions. RNA integrity was determined using an Agilent TapeStation with eRIN values  greater than  7. 500 ng of total RNA was used as input. rRNA was depleted, cDNA (first and second strands) were synthesized, and adaptor index ligation and strand selection was performed (Illumina Stranded total RNA Prep with Ribo-Zero Plus). For multiplexing, barcodes with unique indices out of 96, were used per sample (IDT for Illumina). Libraries were amplified by PCR on a Mastercycler Pro (Eppendorf) and purified with RNAClean XP Agencourt beads (Beckman Coulter).     Libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq1000 (Illumina) to generate 30 M, 75-bp paired end reads per sample.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of Mus-musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.4/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

In astronauts, longitudinal monitoring of physiological systems and interactions between these systems are important to consider for mitigation strategies. In addition, assessments of sex-specific biological responses in the unique environment of spaceflight are vital to support future exploration missions that include both females and males. Here we assessed sex-specific, multi-system immune and endocrine responses to simulated cosmic radiation. For this, 24-week-old, male and female C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to simplified five-ion, space-relevant galactic cosmic ray (GCRsim) radiation at 15 and 50 cGy, to simulate predicted radiation exposures that would be experienced during lunar and Martian missions, respectively. Blood and adrenal tissues were collected at 3- and 14-days post-exposure for analysis of immune and endocrine biosignatures and pathways. Sexually dimorphic adrenal gland weights and morphology, differential total RNA expression, and unique immune phenotypes were altered by GCRsim. In brief, this study offers new insights into sexually dimorphic immune and endocrine kinetics following simulated cosmic radiation exposure and highlights the necessity for personalized translational approaches for astronauts during exploration missions.

          "Study Protocol Description": "All animal experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) protocol number 516. All experiments were performed by trained personnel in AAALAC accredited animal facilities at BNL, while conforming to the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. This study is reported in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines. 24-week-old C57Bl/6J male and female mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (CA, USA) and shipped to Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) 14-days prior to irradiation (IR-14). At arrival to BNL, mice were quarantined and acclimated to a 12h light : 12h dark cycle at standard temperature (23±2°C) and humidity (approximately 50%). Food and water were given ad libitum, and bedding was changed weekly. At IR-4, mice were socially isolated, and, at IR+0, mice irradiated with the 5-ion galactic cosmic ray radiation (GCRsim) at 0, 15, and 50 cGy doses. On day IR-1, mice were transferred to the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) on BNL’s campus by animal care staff. On day IR+0, mice received whole-body irradiation using the simplified 5-ion GCRsim irradiation scheme (protons at 250 and 1000 MeV, 28Si at 600 MeV/n, 4He at 250 MeV/n, 16O at 350 MeV/n, and 56Fe at 600 MeV/n) with 15 and 50 cGy, while 0 cGy sham controls were also performed in similar housing condition, in the absence of irradiation. GCRsim ions, energies, and doses were determined by a NASA consensus formula as previously described. Beam time exposures ranged from ~15 minutes (15 cGy) to 35-45 minutes (50 cGy) per n equals 12 batched cohorts. NSRL GCR and SPE simulations are designed to approximate the chronic mixed field exposures in space by means of sequential acute exposures to a variety of ion/energy combinations.  The exposure protocols are on the NSRL website: https://www.bnl.gov/nsrl/userguide/simgcrsim.php (SimGCRSim).  The dose can be administered either in a single series of exposures lasting approximately an hour or in daily fractions over several weeks.  The GCR simulations are described in detail here: Simonsen LC, Slaba TC, Guida P, Rusek A (2020) NASA’s first ground-based Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: Enabling a new era in space radiobiology research. PLoS Biol 18(5): e3000669. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000669. There are only 0cGy and 50 cGy samples in this dataset.     At IR+14 mice were euthanized by CO2 overdose. Mice were weighed at euthanasia. Adrenals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen with subsequent storage at -80ºC. Blood was collected through the abdominal aorta (11:00–16:00 h).     Total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Thermo Fisher) and purified using Quick-RNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research).     RNA-sequencing libraries were performed using Illumina’s total RNA kit per manufacturer’s instructions. RNA integrity was determined using an Agilent TapeStation with eRIN values  greater than  7. 500 ng of total RNA was used as input. rRNA was depleted, cDNA (first and second strands) were synthesized, and adaptor index ligation and strand selection was performed (Illumina Stranded total RNA Prep with Ribo-Zero Plus). For multiplexing, barcodes with unique indices out of 96, were used per sample (IDT for Illumina). Libraries were amplified by PCR on a Mastercycler Pro (Eppendorf) and purified with RNAClean XP Agencourt beads (Beckman Coulter).     Libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq1000 (Illumina) to generate 30 M, 75-bp paired end reads per sample.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of Mus-musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.4/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F).

          "Study Protocol Description": "One hundred twenty (60 males, 60 females) Fischer rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratory (Wilmington, MA; stock no. 002). At 11 weeks of age, animals underwent castration (CAST) or ovariectomy (OVX) (for males and females, respectively) or sham (SHAM) surgeries at Charles River Laboratory. Surgeries and postoperative care were approved by Charles River Laboratory’s IACUC. Animals were allowed to recover for 1 week and then shipped to BIDMC. Rats arrived at BIDMC at 12 weeks of age. After 48 h of acclimation to BIDMC animal facilities, estrous cycle monitoring of females was initiated. At 14 weeks of age, rats underwent baseline testing for longitudinal variables (described below). Animals were then divided into three different loading groups: 0% partial weight bearing (hindlimb unloading, 0 g), 40% partial weight bearing (simulating Martian gravity, 0.4 g), and 100% partial weight bearing (fully weight bearing controls, 1 g; further described below) and underwent interventions for 28 days. Approximately 48 h before baseline measurements, animals were acclimated to specialized cages suitable for unloading. During inventions all animals were singly housed in a temperature controlled (23 degrees Celsius ) facility with a 12:12-h light-dark cycle. Animals were fed standard LabDiet Formulab Diet rodent chow (catalog no. 5008, irradiated). This product contains a caloric breakdown of 26.6% protein, 16.5% fat, and 56.8% carbohydrate. Food intake was recorded daily. Daily checks were performed to ensure that animals remained in partial-gravity apparatuses and to monitor rodent health. Additionally, animals were weighed weekly. If an animal exhibited significant signs of distress or health problems (greater than 20% body weight loss, anorexia, nongrooming behaviors, etc.) it was removed from the study and euthanized. One animal (M-CAST-0.4g) was removed from the study because of excessive body weight loss. Body weights for rats can be found in OSD-652. All experiments were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC,  081-2020).     Measurements were taken 40 mm distally from the tibial plateau with the following acquisition parameters: voxel size: 0.10 mm, Ct speed: 10 mm/s. Images were then analyzed for density by parsing out different tissues (muscle, fat, bone) through different density thresholds and filters as provided by the manufacturer.     Images were then analyzed for density by parsing out different tissues (muscle, fat, bone) through different density thresholds and filters as provided by the manufacturer. Scanned slices were analyzed using Stratec software (Stratec XCT Analysis System, v6.0, Norland Corp., Fort Atkinson, WI), using a standardized analysis to determine cortical (contour mode 1, peel mode 2, outer and inner threshold of 0.650 g/cm3 ) and trabecular (contour mode 3, peel mode 4, outer threshold of 0.450 g/cm3 , inner threshold of 0.800 g/cm3) vBMD.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining. Specifically, rat identifications and accompanying stats were realigned in the process and dots in blank rows of the file were removed. The resulting file was saved as a .csv file. The raw fat, muscle, bone data files are available in the submitted original files, but the transformed reusable data is only for the summarized data that is supplied.",

          "Study Description": "Gonadal hormones, such as testosterone and estradiol, modulate muscle size and strength in males and females. However, the influence of sex hormones on muscle strength in micro- and partial-gravity environments (e.g., the Moon or Mars) is not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of gonadectomy (castration/ovariectomy) on progression of muscle atrophy in both micro- and partial-gravity environments in male and female rats. Male and female Fischer rats (n equals 120) underwent castration/ovariectomy (CAST/OVX) or sham surgery (SHAM) at 11 weeks of age. After 2 weeks of recovery, rats were exposed to hindlimb unloading (0g), partial weight bearing at 40% of normal loading (0.4g, Martian gravity), or normal loading (1.0g) for 28 days. In males, CAST did not exacerbate body weight loss or other metrics of musculoskeletal health. In females, OVX animals tended to have greater body weight loss and greater gastrocnemius loss. Within 7 days of exposure to either microgravity or partial gravity, females had detectable changes to estrous cycle, with greater time spent in low-estradiol phases diestrus and metestrus (∼47% in 1g vs. 58% in 0g and 72% in 0.4g animals, P equals 0.005). We conclude that in males testosterone deficiency at the initiation of unloading has little effect on the trajectory of muscle loss. In females, initial low estradiol status may result in greater musculoskeletal losses. This study derives results from pQCT (Peripheral quantitative computed tomography).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "One hundred twenty (60 males, 60 females) Fischer rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratory (Wilmington, MA; stock no. 002). At 11 wk of age, animals underwent castration (CAST) or ovariectomy (OVX) (for males and females, respectively) or sham (SHAM) surgeries at Charles River Laboratory. Surgeries and postoperative care were approved by Charles River Laboratory’s IACUC. Animals were allowed to recover for ~1 wk and then shipped to BIDMC. Rats arrived at BIDMC at ~12 wk of age. After 48 h of acclimation to BIDMC animal facilities, estrous cyclemonitoring of females was initiated (described below). At ~14 wk of age, rats underwent baseline testing for longitudinal variables (described below). Animals were then divided into three different loading groups: 0% partial weight bearing (hindlimb unloading, 0 g), 40% partial weight bearing (simulating Martian gravity, 0.4 g), and 100% partial weight bearing (fully weight bearing controls, 1 g; further described below) and underwent interventions for 28 days. Approximately 48 h before baseline measurements, animals were acclimated to specialized cages suitable for unloading, as described previously.  During inventions all animals were singly housed in a temperature controlled (23 degrees Celsius ) facility with a 12:12-h light-dark cycle. Animals were fed standard LabDiet Formulab Diet rodent chow (catalog no. 5008, irradiated). This product contains a caloric breakdown of 26.6% protein, 16.5% fat, and 56.8% carbohydrate. Food intake was recorded daily. Daily checks were performed to ensure that animals remained in partial-gravity apparatuses and to monitor rodent health. Additionally, animals were weighed weekly. If an animal exhibited significant signs of distress or health problems (greater than 20% body weight loss, anorexia, nongrooming behaviors, etc.) it was removed from the study and euthanized. One animal (M-CAST-0.4g) was removed from the study because of excessive body weight loss. All experiments were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC,  081-2020).\n\nIn the submitted original data file, treatment uses C for castration and N for None/Intact. The sample table, under the 'treatment' column uses OVX for females with ovariectomy, and Intact for those with SHAM surgeries.     All sample collections were completed by trained research staff between 8:00 and 10:00 AM. All visualization of vaginal staining was completed by the same researcher (M.E.R.-C.).     The estrous cycle was monitored for ~2 weeks before the start of interventions to establish a baseline for female rats. Estrous cycle monitoring was performed as we and others have previously described. Briefly, a small amount of sterile dH2O (~100 lL) was inserted at the vaginal canal into the vagina with a standard pipette and pipette tip. The vagina was flushed two or three times with the dH2O to collect cells from the vaginal wall. The dH2O containing the vaginal cells was then pipetted onto a microscope slide and allowed to dry (~2–3 h minimum). Microscope slides were then stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution in dH2O (Sigma Aldrich, catalog no. C0775-025G).     After staining, vaginal cells were visualized with a standard white light microscope using a x40 objective. Based on the relative numbers of nucleated epithelial cells, cornified epithelial cells, and leukocytes, estrous cycle phase was determined to be proestrus, estrus, metestrus, or diestrus per previous protocols. All sample collections were completed by trained research staff between 8:00 and 10:00 AM. All visualization of vaginal staining was completed by the same researcher (M.E.R.-C.).     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining. Specifically, in the process of creating the transformed file only the third tab, labeled 'Stats set up for 7 day',of the submitted original .xlsx file was converted to a csv file. The 'Food' column from the same tab was taken from the same tab to supply the sample table with daily recorded food intake. Rat identifications were realigned in the process, and dots in blank rows of the file were removed. This transformed file lists rat identifications vs estrous monitoring data proceeding columns. Values in the transformed reusable file represent percentages of time for each subject in the specific stage of estrous cycle and which phase of the experiment. For the purposes of alignment, the translations of shortened terms are as follows: pre-HU equals before hindlimb unloading, during HU equals during hindlimb unloading, P equals proestrus, E equals estrus, M  equals metestrus, and D equals diestrus. As an additional important note:  the original submitted data file has all level of data collected and scored about estrous cycle staging, but the transformed data file primarily has the percentage data as shown in Figure 6 of Rosa-Caldwell et al., 2023.",

However, the influence of sex hormones on muscle strength in micro- and partial-gravity environments (e.g., the Moon or Mars) is not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of gonadectomy (castration/ovariectomy) on progression of muscle atrophy in both micro- and partial-gravity environments in male and female rats. Male and female Fischer rats (n equals 120) underwent castration/ovariectomy (CAST/OVX) or sham surgery (SHAM) at 11 weeks of age. After 2 weeks of recovery, rats were exposed to hindlimb unloading (0g), partial weight bearing at 40% of normal loading (0.4g, Martian gravity), or normal loading (1.0g) for 28 days. In males, CAST did not exacerbate body weight loss or other metrics of musculoskeletal health. In females, OVX animals tended to have greater body weight loss and greater gastrocnemius loss. Within 7 days of exposure to either microgravity or partial gravity, females had detectable changes to estrous cycle, with greater time spent in low-estradiol phases diestrus and metestrus (∼47% in 1g vs. 58% in 0g and 72% in 0.4g animals, P equals 0.005). We conclude that in males testosterone deficiency at the initiation of unloading has little effect on the trajectory of muscle loss. In females, initial low estradiol status may result in greater musculoskeletal losses. This study derives results from Estrous Cycle Monitoring (Cytology).",

The sample table, under the 'treatment' column uses CAST for castrated males, OVX for females with ovariectomy, and Intact for those with SHAM surgeries.     Rats were gently held and restrained by a trained researcher. Then, rodents’ rear paws were placed on a grip bar attached to a 50-N-capacity force transducer (Chatillon, Agawam, MA).     Animals were gently pulled from the bar until they voluntarily released their grip. The corresponding force was recorded. After a brief (~30–60 s) recovery, the measurement was repeated twice. The maximal force across the three trials was used for analysis. Grip strength was measured before and after interventions.

          "Study Protocol Description": "The rodents’ left foot was taped to the foot plate with medical-grade tape (3M Transpore Surgical Tape, catalog no. 1527). To ensure consistency of data collection, the foot plate position was adjusted to 90 of dorsiflexion. The left peroneal and tibial nerves were stimulated to produce dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, respectively.     Rats were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and a standard vaporizing system. Under anesthesia, animals were placed on a foot plate system (Dual Mode Muscle Lever System; Aurora Scientific) as previously reported. To ensure appropriate needle placement, a small (10 Hz) twitch was applied and recorded. Once needle placement was finalized, nerves were stimulated at 200 Hz for 200 ms to achieve a maximal tetanus. Visual inspection of the contraction was performed to ensure that tetanus was reached. Animals were anesthetized for 5 min for this procedure; therefore, we do not anticipate that animals had significant drop in force production due to temperature loss. The experiment was performed twice in total, once right before unloading (T0) and once 28 days after unloading (T28).     One hundred twenty (60 males, 60 females) Fischer rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratory (Wilmington, MA; stock no. 002).

Within 7 days of exposure to either microgravity or partial gravity, females had detectable changes to estrous cycle, with greater time spent in low-estradiol phases diestrus and metestrus (∼47% in 1g vs. 58% in 0g and 72% in 0.4g animals, P equals 0.005). We conclude that in males testosterone deficiency at the initiation of unloading has little effect on the trajectory of muscle loss. In females, initial low estradiol status may result in greater musculoskeletal losses. This study derives results from Force Plate.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "For the hindlimb suspension (HLS) experiments, the hindlimbs of male GSK3mKD and GSK3flox (4–6 month old) mice were suspended using a taping method where the tails of mice were taped to a copper ring attached to a steel bar that was mounted on top of a modified mouse cage. For these experiments, mice were pair-housed in the cages and had as libitum access to food and water.     HLS mice were subjected to anesthesia under isoflurane for in vivo DXA scanning.     A small animal DXA scanner (OsteoSys InSIGHT, Scintica) was used to scan the individual femur bones collected from the RR9 mission. Overall coefficient of variation of our analysis was 1.7% for BMD and 3.2% for BMC. In addition, we also performed region-specific BMD analysis for the tibia, femur, and lumbar spine from mobile and HLS GSK3mKD and GSK3flox mice.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.",

          "Study Description": "We examined the effects of ~30 days of spaceflight on glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) content and inhibitory serine phosphorylation in murine muscle and bone samples from four separate missions (BION-M1, Rodent Research RR1, RR9, and RR18). Spaceflight reduced GSK3b content across all missions, whereas its serine phosphorylation was elevated with RR18 and BION-M1. The reduction in GSK3b was linked to the reduction in type IIA fibers commonly observed with spaceflight as these fibers are particularly enriched with GSK3. We then tested the effects of inhibiting GSK3 before this fiber type shift, and we demonstrate that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased muscle mass, preserved muscle strength, and promoted the oxidative fiber type with Earth-based hindlimb unloading. In bone, GSK3 activation was enhanced after spaceflight; and strikingly, muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion increased bone mineral density in response to hindlimb unloading. Thus, future studies should test the effects of GSK3 inhibition during spaceflight. This study derives results from the DXA Scanning assay using lumbar spine tissue from HLS mice. The lumbar spine data in this study are related to other studies using tissues from the same experiment; OSD-654 (tibia), OSD-660 (tibialis anterior), OSD-662 (soleus), OSD-663 (femur), and OSD-664 (extensor digitorum longus).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "All experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of University of California (San Francisco, Protocol Number: AN181839) and Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL, Upton, NY). Female (N equals 60) and male (N equals 60) C57BL6/J wildtype (WT) mice 24 weeks of age were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and directly delivered to BNL in grouped cages. Mouse ages were timed for comparability to previous experiments and to represent a middle-aged adult astronaut. One female animal died before the experiment began. Each experimental group was assigned 10 mice, except normally loaded SI females, which was assigned 9 mice. A power calculation was not used to determine sample size; sample size was selected based norms for behavioral testing and maximum total colony capacity for the lab staff. Female and male mice were housed in separate rooms at BNL on a normal 12:12 light cycle. Animals acclimated at BNL for 1 week before animals in the two social isolation groups were separated into isolation housing in HU cages at 25 weeks of age. All isolated animals subsequently remained isolated for the duration of the experiment. Group housed controls remained in standard cages. Mice in the SI+HU group were unloaded at 26 weeks of age by a pulley apparatus with orthopedic traction tape as previously described. The SI-only group remained normally loaded. Animals were checked twice a day, and re-loading events were recorded and corrected. At 27 weeks of age, animals underwent simplified 5-ion Galactic Cosmic Ray simulation (GCRsim) exposure at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory during their light cycle. Sham irradiated animals were loaded into the ‘mouse hotel’, but not placed on the beam line. The SI + HU group remained unloaded during irradiation. Animals were reloaded at 29 weeks of age, after a total of 18 days of HU. Following 5 days of recovery, mice were shipped to UCSF via World CourierTM for behavioral and cellular analysis. At UCSF, animals were housed on a reverse light cycle in environmentally controlled conditions (12:12 h light:dark cycle at 21 ± 1 °C; ~ 50% humidity) with access to food and water ad libidum. Female and male mice were housed in the same room.     Upon arrival at UCSF, seven days after reloading, blood was collected via tail vein puncture. A small nick was made in the tail vein using a scalpel and ~ 40 μl of blood was removed using a pipette and placed in a small tube containing EDTA (Sigma). Blood was used to measure early changes in peripheral blood biomarkers. Following the completion of behavioral assays, animals were lethally overdosed using carbon dioxide. Once completely anesthetized, the chest cavity was opened, and mice were perfused with 1 × phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.4 (Gibco) until the liver was clear (~ 1–2 min). Cardiac blood was collected at this time.     Mice were irradiated with 50 cGy of the NASA-approved simplified GCRsim protocol during the experimental campaign NSRL21A. The simplified GCRsim consisted of 35% protons (1000 meV), 1% silicon, 18% helium, 6% oxygen, 1% iron, and 39% protons (250 MeV). Energies were 1000 MeV/n protons (LET equals 0.20 keV/μm), 600 MeV/n silicon ions (LET equals 50.4 keV/μm), 250 MeV/n helium ions (LET equals 1.60 keV/ μm), 350 MeV/n oxygen ions (LET equals 20.9 keV/μm), and 250 MeV/n protons (LET equals 0.40 keV/μm). Mice were transported to the NSRL the night before exposure and returned to the animal care facility several hours after irradiation. During each exposure, mice were loaded into 7.3 × 4.0 × 4.0 cm polystyrene restraint boxes with air holes and mounted on the beam line. SI + HU animals remained at a declining angle by means of a wire attached to the tail harness and fixed to the restraint box holder outside the box. Due to the size of the box, hindlimbs could touch the wall of the restraint box. The beam spot size was 60×60 cm and animals were placed in the center of the field to assure best uniformity. The measured doses for the four runs were 50.0020 cGy delivered over 17.46 min, 50.0034 cGy delivered over 12.28 min, 50.0029 cGy delivered over 27.99 min, and 50.0021 cGy delivered over 42.76 min. NSRL GCR and SPE simulations are designed to approximate the chronic mixed field exposures in space by means of sequential acute exposures to a variety of ion/energy combinations.  The exposure protocols are on the NSRL website: https://www.bnl.gov/nsrl/userguide/simgcrsim.php (SimGCRSim).  The dose can be administered either in a single series of exposures lasting approximately an hour or in daily fractions over several weeks.  The GCR simulations are described in detail here: Simonsen LC, Slaba TC, Guida P, Rusek A (2020) NASA’s first ground-based Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: Enabling a new era in space radiobiology research. PLoS Biol 18(5): e3000669. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000669.     Data were collected on Canto II (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (v10, Tree Star Inc.).     The antibody panel included anti-CD45 [fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–conjugated; BD Biosciences], CD11b [PacificBlue–conjugated; BD Biosciences], CD3 [allophycocyanin (APC)–conjugated; BD Biosciences], CD4 [AmCyan–conjugated; BD Biosciences], CD8 [PerCp-Cyanine5.5–conjugated; BD Biosciences], CD19 [APC-Cy7–conjugated; BD Biosciences], Ly6G [phycoerythrin cyanine-7 (PE)–conjugated; BD Biosciences], and NK1.1 [PE–conjugated; BD Biosciences].     Circulating leukocyte populations were evaluated 17 and 100 days following GCRsim. Blood was stained with surface antibodies for 30–60 min at room temperature.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures).

          "Study Description": "Interplanetary space travel poses many hazards to the human body. To protect astronaut health and performance on critical missions, there is first a need to understand the effects of deep space hazards, including ionizing radiation, confinement, and altered gravity. Previous studies of rodents exposed to a single such stressor document significant deficits, but our study is the first to investigate possible cumulative and synergistic impacts of simultaneous ionizing radiation, confinement, and altered gravity on behavior and cognition. Our cohort was divided between 6‐month‐old female and male mice in group, social isolation, or hindlimb unloading housing, exposed to 0 or 50 cGy of 5 ion simplified simulated galactic cosmic radiation (GCRsim). We report interactions and independent effects of GCRsim exposure and housing conditions on behavioral and cognitive performance. Exposure to GCRsim drove changes in immune cell populations in peripheral blood collected early after irradiation, while housing conditions drove changes in blood collected at a later point. Female mice were largely resilient to deficits observed in male mice. Finally, we used principal component analysis to represent total deficits as principal component scores, which were predicted by general linear models using GCR exposure, housing condition, and early blood biomarkers. This dataset derives results from the flow cytometry assay using blood samples from same source animals used for behavioral studies in OSD-618.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "10 to 12-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were assigned to three main groups: control, hindlimb unloading or hindlimb reloading. For the hindlimb unloading phase, mice were slightly suspended by tail for the specified number of days, up to 10 days. Briefly, mice were placed inside a restrainer and, using hypoallergenic medical tape, a nylon line was attached in a helical pattern around the base of the tail. The line was connected to a small swivel keychain with metal rings that were attached to a rod running the length of the cage (GR900, Tecniplast). To prevent their hind legs from carrying any weight, the hindlimbs were kept just off the ground with the mouse’s body at an approximately 30-degree angle. Mice were able to move freely on the y-axis, rotate 360-degree using their forelegs, and had access to one side of the cage with food and water ad libitum.\nMice were housed in pairs during the unloading phase. The reloading phase consisted of 10 days of hindlimb unloading, after which the animals were returned to normal ambulation in conventional cages for the specified number of days. Control mice were kept in conventional cages throughout the entire protocol with food and water ad libitum. All animal experiments were approved by the regional animal ethics committee of Northern Stockholm, Sweden.     All tissues were collected, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80C until analysis.     Total RNA was extracted from gastrocnemius muscles of mice using TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) as per the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was purified and treated with DNase using NucleoSpin RNA II columns (Machery Nagel) to remove any remaining DNA contaminants. RNA integrity was verified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer, with all samples showing RNA integrity number (RIN) greater than 8.     Stranded mRNA Library Preparation Kit was used with a polyA-enrichment strategy to prepare the sequencing libraries.     RNA-sequencing was performed at the SciLifeLab (Stockholm, Sweden) using the Illumina HiSeq2000, generating 100-bp paired-end reads.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of Mus-musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 09-May-2025.",

Gastrocnemius muscle samples were obtained from three groups: control mice, mice subjected to 10 days of hindlimb unloading-induced muscle atrophy, and mice reintroduced to normal cage activity for 1 day following the unloading period (reloading). Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for mouse gastrocnemius muscle from model of hindlimb unloading/reloading assessing transitions from atrophy to compensatory regeneration and hypertrophy. Control mice were kept in conventional cages throughout the entire protocol. Experiment was performed in replicates (Control n equals 4, Unloading n equals 2, Reloading n equals 3). Paired-end DNA libraries were prepared using Illumina TrueSeq and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2000.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Immunoblot analysis was performed on 6 frozen left ventricle tissue samples randomly selected from each radiation group, radiation dose, and time point. A Potter-Elvehjem mechanical compact stirrer (BDC2002, Caframo LabSolutions, Georgia Bluffs, ON, Canada) was used to homogenize the tissue in a 1% Triton-X100 radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing protease inhibitors (1:100) and phosphatase inhibitors (1:100; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Protein concentration was determined with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Bio-Rad), and 25 μg protein was added to a 2x Laemmli buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol (5%). Gel electrophoresis was performed, and proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane.     Gel electrophoresis was performed, and proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane.     Membranes were first incubated in tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.05% Tween-20 and 5% non-fat dry milk to reduce non-specific antibody binding. They were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with rat anti-α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA, 1:4000 dilution, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or one of the following antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology): rabbit anti-collagen type III (1:1000), rabbit anti-mast cell tryptase (1:20,000), rabbit anti-cleaved and full-length caspase-3 (1:3000), rabbit anti-CD2 (1:3000), rabbit anti-CD68 (1:1000), rat anti- CD45 (1:40,000), or mouse anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, 1:20,000) as a loading control; all were prepared in TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 and 5% non-fat dry milk.     Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with rat anti-α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA, 1:4000 dilution, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or one of the following antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology): rabbit anti-collagen type III (1:1000), rabbit anti-mast cell tryptase (1:20,000), rabbit anti-cleaved and full-length caspase-3 (1:3000), rabbit anti-CD2 (1:3000), rabbit anti-CD68 (1:1000), rat anti-CD45 (1:40,000), or mouse anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, 1:20,000) as a loading control; all were prepared in TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 and 5% non-fat dry milk.     Membranes were covered in enhanced chemiluminescence  (ECL) Plus Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chicago, IL) and placed on CL-Xposure Film (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Films were developed and imaged with an AlphaImager® gel documentation system (ProteinSimple, San Jose, CA).     Densitometry was performed with ImageJ software. All proteins were normalized to GAPDH, and then calculated relative to 0 Gy at each time point.     Bound antibodies were visualized with 0.5 mg/mL 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich) and counterstained with hematoxylin. Stained sections were examined with an Axioskop transmitted-light microscope (Carl Zeiss), and CD45-positive cells were counted in 10 optical areas per section.     CD45-positive cells were counted in 10 optical areas per section. Cells were counted by one individual (M.C.) who was aware of the animal identification numbers but not the treatment groups. The number of CD45-positive cells was divided by the total area of the 10 views.     Sections were rehydrated, and antigen retrieval was performed by incubating the sections in Target Retrieval buffer (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) at 120 °C in a decloaking chamber (Biocare Medical, Pacheco, CA) for 20 min, cooling them for 45 min in the retrieval buffer, and rinsing in distilled water. Immediately after, sections were incubated in 1% H2O2 in methanol to block endogenous peroxidase, followed by 10% normal serum in 3% dry powdered milk and 0.2% bovine serum albumin to block non-specific antibody binding. Sections were incubated overnight with rat anti-CD45 (1:100 dilution, clone 30-F11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz CA), followed by biotinylated goat anti-rat IgG (1:400, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 45 min.     To quantify tissue collagen deposition, 5-μm longitudinal sections of heart and 5-μm cross sections of aorta were rehydrated and incubated with Sirius Red supplemented with Fast Green. Sections were scanned with a ScanScope CS2 slide scanner and analyzed with ImageScope 12 software (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany).     For histopathological analysis, 5-μm longitudinal sections of heart were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H and E). For each experimental group, 1 section of 5 randomly selected hearts was shipped to a veterinary pathologist for analysis (Stanley D. Kosanke, DVM, PhD Heartland Veterinary Pathology Services, Edmond, OK). Sections were assessed and scored for inflammation, myofiber necrosis, interstitial fibrosis, microvascular damage, and epicardial fibrosis. To quantify tissue collagen deposition, 5-μm longitudinal sections of heart and 5-μm cross sections of aorta were rehydrated and incubated with Sirius Red supplemented with Fast Green. To quantify mast cells, sections were incubated in 0.5% Toluidine Blue in 0.5 N HCl for 3 days at room temperature, followed by 0.7 N HCl for 10 min. Apoptotic nuclei were identified with the CardioTACS™ Kit (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD), which is based on DNA end-labeling with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, following the manufacturer's instructions.     To quantify mast cells, sections were incubated in 0.5% Toluidine Blue in 0.5 N HCl for 3 days at room temperature, followed by 0.7 N HCl for 10 min. Eosin was used as a counterstain. Apoptotic nuclei were identified with the CardioTACS™ Kit (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD), which is based on DNA end-labeling with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, following the manufacturer's instructions. Both Toluidine Blue and CardioTACS-stained sections were examined with an Axioskop transmitted-light microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Mast cells and apoptotic nuclei were counted by one individual (M.C.) who was aware of the animal identification numbers but not the treatment groups. Numbers of mast cells and apoptotic nuclei were divided by the total tissue area of each section as determined with ImageScope 12 software (Leica Biosystems).     Male C57BL/6 J mice (1–2 months old) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed 5 per cage at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) until they were 6 months old. Mice were fed a low-soy diet (2020X, Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN, USA) because soy contains radioprotective compounds, including genistein. They had access to chow and water ad libitum and were housed on a 12:12 h light:dark cycle.     At 6 months old, mice were transported to Brookhaven National Laboratory. After a 1-week acclimation period at BNL, mice were exposed to whole-body proton and/or 16O irradiation at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL). Unanesthetized mice were placed in individualized clear and well-ventilated Lucite cubes (3 in×1½ in×1½ in) and positioned 4 to 5 at a time in the NSRL beam line. There were 4 cohorts of mice that received radiation at NSRL. In cohort 1, mice received a single dose of 0.1 Gy, 0.25 Gy, or 1.0 Gy 16O (600 MeV/n) at a dose rate of 0.25−0.26 Gy/min during NSRL run 15A. In cohort 2, mice were exposed to a single dose of 0.5 Gy or 1 Gy protons (150 MeV) at a dose rate of 0.35−0.55 Gy/min during NSRL run 15C. In cohort 3, mice were exposed to a single dose of 0.05 Gy 16O (600 MeV/n) at a dose rate of 0.04−0.05 Gy/min during NSRL run 16B. In cohort 4, mice were exposed to a single dose of protons (150 MeV, 0.5 Gy, 0.17−0.19 Gy/min) followed by 16O an hour later (600 MeV/n, 0.1 Gy, 0.18−0.33 Gy/min) during NSRL run 16B Radiation dosimetry was performed by the NSRL physics team. For each NSRL run, age matched sham-irradiated mice were also transported to NSRL and placed in identical clear Lucite cubes, but they were not exposed to 16O or protons. At 6 months old, a fourth cohort of mice was exposed to γ-rays using a cesium-137 (137Cs) source (Mark 1 Model 68A, J L Shepherd and Associates, San Fernando, CA) at UAMS as a reference, at a dose rate of 1 Gy/min and to total doses of 0.5 Gy, 1 Gy, or 3 Gy. For this purpose, unanesthetized mice were placed in a clear, well-ventilated pie-shaped Plexiglas holder with individual compartments (5 mice per holder) and exposed in the 137Cs source irradiator on a turntable (6 rpm) for even radiation exposure. Radiation dosimetry was performed with DOSEJ MAP® gafchromic films (Ashland Specialty Ingredients, Wayne, NJ) and with an ion chamber calibrated for cesium (Exradin A20, Standard Imaging, Middleton, WI). For sham irradiation, age-matched animals were placed in the pie-shaped holder for 5 min but not exposed to radiation. A total of 35 mice (40 in the combined proton and 16O group) were allocated to each radiation dose. Of these mice, 10 were followed for up to 2 weeks after irradiation or sham-treatment, 10 were followed up to 3 months, and 15 (20 in the consecutive proton and 16O group) were followed up to 9 months. Cesium-137 produces gamma rays with an energy of 0.662 MeV and has a half-life of 30.1 years. GeneLab calculated exposure duration based on absorbed radiation dose and dose rate. Ionizing radiation energy values were added by GeneLab.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a western blot, immunohistochemistry, and histology microscopy data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all western blot, immunohistochemistry, and histology results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.     Mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane and weighed. A modified infusion set (27 G with shortened tubing) was used to inject a single dose of heparin (30−40 U/kg) into the abdominal vena cava. Then, the heart was collected, rinsed, weighed, and cut into 2 longitudinal halves. One half of the heart was fixed in 5% formalin for 24 h and embedded in paraffin for histology and immunohistochemistry. The other half was divided into atria, right ventricle, and 4 samples of left ventricle; all tissue samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until preparation for immunoblotting. Within 10 min after collecting the heart, the abdominal aorta was collected and fixed in 5% formalin for histology. Lastly, skin and muscle were removed from the tibia bone, and calipers.",

Because there is concern about the adverse effects of space radiation on the cardiovascular system, this study assessed cardiac function and structure and immune cell infiltration in a mouse model of charged particle irradiation. Materials and methods: Male C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to oxygen ions (16O, 600 MeV/n at 0.25 to 0.26 Gy/min to a total dose of 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, or 1 Gy), protons (150 MeV, 0.35 to 0.55 Gy/min to 0, 0.5, or 1 Gy), or protons (150 MeV, 0.5 Gy) followed by 16O (600 MeV/n, 0.1 Gy). Separate groups of mice received 137Cs γ rays (1 Gy/min to 0, 0.5, 1, or 3 Gy) as a reference. Cardiac function and blood velocity were measured with ultrasonography at 3, 5, 7, and 9 months after irradiation. At 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months, cardiac tissue was collected to assess apoptosis, tissue remodeling, and markers of immune cells. Results: Ejection fraction and fractional shortening decreased at 3 and 7 months after 16O. These parameters did not change in mice exposed to γ rays, protons, or protons followed by 16O. Each of the radiation exposures caused only small increases in cleaved caspase3 and numbers of apoptotic nuclei. Changes in the levels of α smooth muscle cell actin and a 75kDa peptide of collagen type III in the left ventricle suggested tissue remodeling, but there was no significant change in total collagen deposition at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months. Increases in protein amounts of cluster of differentiation (CD)2, CD68, and CD45 as measured with immunoblots at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months after exposure to protons or 16O alone suggested immune cell infiltration. For type III collagen, CD2 and CD68, the efficacy in inducing protein abundance of CD2, CD68, and CD45 was 16O greater than protons was greater than γ rays greater than protons followed by 16O. Conclusions: Low dose, high energy charged particle irradiation caused mild changes in cardiac function and tissue remodeling in the mouse. This dataset derives result from the western blot, histology, and immunohistochemistry assays.",

Of these mice, 10 were followed for up to 2 weeks after irradiation or sham-treatment, 10 were followed up to 3 months, and 15 (20 in the consecutive proton and 16O group) were followed up to 9 months.Cesium-137 produces gamma rays with an energy of 0.662 MeV and has a half-life of 30.1 years. GeneLab calculated exposure duration based on absorbed radiation dose and dose rate. Ionizing radiation energy values were added by GeneLab.     Mice underwent ultrasonography in random order and performed by one individual. Because anesthesia is known to alter cardiac physiology, we developed a procedure in which mice were under anesthesia for the shortest possible time during ultra-sonography. Hence, the day before ultrasonography, mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane, and hair was removed from the thorax and abdomen with depilatory cream. On the day of ultrasonography, mice were anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane and placed supine on a heated platform that monitors respiration rate and generates an electrocardiogram. The mice were scanned immediately with a Vevo 2100 high-resolution pre-clinical small animal imaging system (VisualSonics,Toronto, ON) with a MS400 (18–38 MHz) transducer. Echocardiograms were obtained in the short axis M-mode at the mid-left ventricular level. These echocardiograms were similar to those obtained by Yan et al. (Yan et al., 2014), albeit by different ultrasound equipment and a higher-frequency probe (18–38 MHz vs. 15 MHz).     Echocardiograms were obtained in the short axis M-mode at the mid-left ventricular level. These echocardiograms were similar to those obtained by Yan et al. (Yan et al., 2014), albeit by different ultrasound equipment and a higher-frequency probe (18–38 MHz vs. 15 MHz as in (Yan et al., 2014)). Pulsed-wave Doppler was used to determine abdominal aortic blood flow as an indicator of both cardiac and vascular function. For this purpose, the probe was placed in the transverse axis, immediately anterior to the renal artery branch point.     Mice underwent ultrasonography in random order and performed by one individual (M.B.). One individual (P.S.) analyzed all of the ultrasonography output files, in random order. She was aware of the animal identification numbers, but these numbers did not identify the experimental groups. All ultrasound analyses were spot checked by M.B. on a weekly basis. In addition, when there was doubt about an individual ultrasound recording or results obtained, P.S. and M.B. would re-analyze the recordings together to make sure there was agreement.     The Vevo 2100 software version 1.6.0 cardiac package was used to obtain echocardiographic parameters, such as stroke volume (SV), ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening (FS) and cardiac output (CO) from 3 M-mode scans per animal. The vascular package was used to assess mitral valve E and A velocities and blood flow parameters from 3 consecutive wave patterns per pulsed-wave Doppler scan, in up to 3 scans per animal. Blood velocity measures were obtained from velocity time integral (VTI) traces and from separate velocity measurements in each scan.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with an echocardiography data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all echocardiography results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.     Mice underwent ultrasonography in random order and performed by one individual.

Because there is concern about the adverse effects of space radiation on the cardiovascular system, this study assessed cardiac function and structure and immune cell infiltration in a mouse model of charged particle irradiation. Materials and methods: Male C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to oxygen ions (16O, 600 MeV/n at 0.25 to 0.26 Gy/min to a total dose of 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, or 1 Gy), protons (150 MeV, 0.35 to 0.55 Gy/min to 0, 0.5, or 1 Gy), or protons (150 MeV, 0.5 Gy) followed by 16O (600 MeV/n, 0.1 Gy). Separate groups of mice received 137Cs γ rays (1 Gy/min to 0, 0.5, 1, or 3 Gy) as a reference. Cardiac function and blood velocity were measured with ultrasonography at 3, 5, 7, and 9 months after irradiation. At 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months, cardiac tissue was collected to assess apoptosis, tissue remodeling, and markers of immune cells. Results: Ejection fraction and fractional shortening decreased at 3 and 7 months after 16O. These parameters did not change in mice exposed to γ rays, protons, or protons followed by 16O. Each of the radiation exposures caused only small increases in cleaved caspase3 and numbers of apoptotic nuclei. Changes in the levels of α smooth muscle cell actin and a 75kDa peptide of collagen type III in the left ventricle suggested tissue remodeling, but there was no significant change in total collagen deposition at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months. Increases in protein amounts of cluster of differentiation (CD)2, CD68, and CD45 as measured with immunoblots at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months after exposure to protons or 16O alone suggested immune cell infiltration. For type III collagen, CD2 and CD68, the efficacy in inducing protein abundance of CD2, CD68, and CD45 was 16O greater than protons was greater than γ rays greater than protons followed by 16O. Conclusions: Low dose, high energy charged particle irradiation caused mild changes in cardiac function and tissue remodeling in the mouse. This dataset derives result from the cardiac ultrasound and abdominal aorta doppler (echocardiography) assays.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "After removing the surrounding soft tissue, the left femur was wrapped in saline-soaked gauze and stored at −20 °C for ex vivo microCT analysis and biomechanical testing, whereas the right femur was stored in 70% ethanol at 4 °C for dynamic histomorphometry. All experimental protocols were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and animal experiments were conducted according to the guidelines of the IACUC.     The frozen left femurs were thawed and subjected to three-point bending (Instron 8511 MTS, Instron, Norwood, MA). To determine the femoral stiffness (N·mm2), maximum moment (N·mm), and failure moment (N·mm), each femur was loaded to failure on the posterior surface at a constant displacement rate of 3mm/min with the two lower supports spaced 20 mm apart. Force-displacement data were acquired at 100 Hz. Estimated elastic modulus (MPa) was calculated using the moment of inertia derived from microCT scans.     Microcomputed tomographic (μCT) imaging was performed on the distal metaphysis and mid-diaphysis of the femur, using a high-resolution desktop imaging system (μCT40, Scanco Medical AG, Brttisellen, Switzerland) in accordance with the published guidelines for the use of μCT in rodents. Scans were acquired using a 15 μm3 isotropic voxel size, 70 kVp and 114 mA peak x-ray tube potential and intensity, 300 ms integration time, and were subjected to Gaussian filtration. We determined femoral length by measuring the distance from the femoral head to the distal end of femoral condyles on μCT scans. The distal metaphyseal region that we analyzed began 600 μm proximal to the distal growth plate and extended proximally 2.1mm. Cortical bone morphology was evaluated in the femoral mid-diaphysis in a region that started 55% of the bone length below the femoral head and extended 1050 μm distally.     Global thresholds of 360 and 700 mg HA/cm3 were used for evaluation of trabecular and cortical bone, respectively. Trabecular bone outcomes included trabecular bone volume fraction (Tb.BV/TV, mm3/mm3), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, mm), trabecular number (Tb.N, 1/mm), and separation (mm). Cortical bone outcomes included cortical tissue mineral density (Ct.TMD, mg HA/cm3), cortical thickness (Ct.Th, μm), total cross-sectional and cortical bone areas (Tt.Ar, Ct.Ar, mm2), cortical bone area fraction (Ct.Ar/Tt.Ar, %), and the maximum and minimum moments of inertia (Imax and Imin, mm4)     To examine BFR, calcein (25 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally at 10 and 3 days prior to sacrifice. Longitudinal 5-μm thick undecalcified plastic sections were used to measure static and dynamic parameters in trabecular bone in the distal metaphyseal femur, using OsteoMeasure software (Osteometrics; n equals 5/group). For static histomorphometry, osteo- blast (Ob.S/BS) and osteoclast surface (Oc.S/BS) along the trabecular bone was measured. For dynamic histomorphometry, mineralizing surface per bone surface (MS/BS, %) and MAR (μm/day) were measured on unstained sections to calculate BFR (μm3/μm2/day) according to ASBMR guidelines.     Male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA) weighing 408 ± 0.15 g (14 weeks of age) were obtained and housed in a temperature-controlled (22 ± 2 °C) room with a 12:12-h light–dark cycle. Water and chow were provided ad libitum. Throughout the experiment, rats were assessed daily for any signs of pain or discomfort (e.g., porphyrin staining around eyes, poor grooming, and/or hair loss), harness and jacket fitting, ability to walk and move across the cage, as well as food and water intake. At the end of the study, rats were euthanized by CO2 inhalation and hind limbs were harvested. All experimental protocols were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and animal experiments were conducted according to the guidelines of the IACUC.  Animals were assigned to one of four groups: normal loading (PWB100), and 70% (PWB70), 40% (PWB40), and 20% (PWB20) of normal loading via quadrupedal suspension. These PWB groups were chosen to mimic gravitational forces on Earth (1 G), moderate artificial gravity (0.7 G), Mars (0.4 G), and Moon (0.2 G). Animals were assigned to experimental groups based on pre-PWB body weight to ensure similar average and variability in body weight across all groups. Groups were suspended for 1, 2, or 4 weeks (n  equals  11–12/group). Rats were assigned to each group to ensure balanced distribution of the body weight across all groups. After 2 days of acclimation in custom cages and jackets, rats were suspended according to their PWB groups. Rats were secured in a tether jacket and a pelvic harness and submitted to a two-point suspension allowing them to adopt a normal quadrupedal behavior, while weighing 100, 70, 40, or 20% of their body weight. Animals were weighed daily in their PWB apparatus and the chain link to the two-point suspension was adjusted if needed to ensure that their achieved unloading level remained constant based on PWB groups.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.",

          "Study Description": "Reduced skeletal loading leads to marked bone loss. Animal models of hindlimb suspension are widely used to assess alterations in skeleton during the course of complete unloading. More recently, the effects of partial unloading on the musculoskeletal system have been interrogated in mice and rats, revealing dose-dependent effects of partial weight bearing (PWB) on the skeleton and skeletal muscle. Here, we extended these studies to determine the structural and functional skeletal alterations in 14-week-old male Wister rats exposed to 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 1, 2, or 4 weeks (n  equals 11–12/group). Using in vivo pQCT, we found that trabecular bone density at the proximal tibia declined in proportion to the degree of unloading and continued progressively with time, without evidence of a plateau by 4 weeks. Ex vivo measurements of trabecular microarchitecture in the distal femur by microcomputed tomography revealed deficits in bone volume fraction, 2 and 4 weeks after unloading. Histologic analyses of trabecular bone in the distal femur revealed the decreased osteoblast number and mineralizing surface in unloaded rats. Three-point bending of the femoral diaphysis indicated modest or no reductions in femoral stiffness and estimated modulus due to PWB. Our results suggest that this rat model of PWB leads to trabecular bone deterioration that is progressive and generally proportional to the degree of PWB, with minimal effects on cortical bone. This study derives results from the Mechanical Testing, Bone Microstructure (microCT), and bone histomorphometry assays using femur tissue.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "At baseline and weekly thereafter, we assessed trabecular vBMD at the right proximal tibia and cortical vBMD at the tibial mid-diaphysis, using in vivo pQCT (Stratec, XCT Research SA+, Pforzheim, Germany). Scans were performed using a voxel size of 100 μm and a scanning beam thickness of 500 μm. Daily calibration was performed using a manufacturer-supplied hydroxyapatite phantom. Transverse images of right tibia were acquired at 5.0, 5.5, 6.0 mm (for total and trabecular vBMD), and at 20 and 20.5 mm (for cortical vBMD) from the proximal tibial plateau. During the scan, rats were under isoflurane-induced anesthesia.\n\nLongitudinal images were visually inspected, and matched based on the distance from the proximal tibial plateau and shape of the proximal tibial metaphysis and fibula to ensure anatomically consistent location for analysis. Scanned slices were analyzed using Stratec software (Stratec XCT Analysis System, v6.0, Norland Corp., Fort Atkinson, WI), using a standardized analysis to determine cortical (contour mode 1, peel mode 2, outer and inner threshold of 0.650 g/cm3) and trabecular (contour mode 3, peel mode 4, outer threshold of 0.450 g/cm3, inner threshold of 0.800 g/cm3) vBMD.

          "Study Description": "Reduced skeletal loading leads to marked bone loss. Animal models of hindlimb suspension are widely used to assess alterations in skeleton during the course of complete unloading. More recently, the effects of partial unloading on the musculoskeletal system have been interrogated in mice and rats, revealing dose-dependent effects of partial weight bearing (PWB) on the skeleton and skeletal muscle. Here, we extended these studies to determine the structural and functional skeletal alterations in 14-week-old male Wister rats exposed to 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 1, 2, or 4 weeks (n  equals 11–12/group). Using in vivo pQCT, we found that trabecular bone density at the proximal tibia declined in proportion to the degree of unloading and continued progressively with time, without evidence of a plateau by 4 weeks. Ex vivo measurements of trabecular microarchitecture in the distal femur by microcomputed tomography revealed deficits in bone volume fraction, 2 and 4 weeks after unloading. Histologic analyses of trabecular bone in the distal femur revealed the decreased osteoblast number and mineralizing surface in unloaded rats. Three-point bending of the femoral diaphysis indicated modest or no reductions in femoral stiffness and estimated modulus due to PWB. Our results suggest that this rat model of PWB leads to trabecular bone deterioration that is progressive and generally proportional to the degree of PWB, with minimal effects on cortical bone. This study derives results from the pQCT assay using tibia tissue.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "At UMBC the rats were maintained on a 12:12 light:dark cycle. Food and water were continuously available. All procedures were approved by the UMBC and Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees.     The rats were exposed to 56Fe (1 GeV/n) particles at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory at BNL. For irradiation, the rats were placed in well-ventilated plastic tubes which were located perpendicular to the beam with the head of the rat placed in the center of the beam. As a consequence of this placement, the shoulders of the rats received some exposure to the particles. The experiment was run in two replications separated by 8 months. The first replication involved exposing the 7- and 16-month old rats to 56Fe particles; the 2- and 12-month old rats were irradiated in the second replication. The doses (10 subjects per dose) to which the rats were exposed varied as a function of the age of the rats. The 7- and 16-month old rats were exposed to 50 and 150 cGy; the 2-month old rats were exposed to 50, 150, and 200 cGy; and the 12-month old rats were exposed to 25, 50, and 150 cGy. All exposures were at a nominal dose rate of 50–100 cGy/min. The control rats (0 cGy) were age matched to the irradiated rats, but were not exposed. Except for not being placed in the beam line, the control rats were treated identically to the irradiated rats and were tested at the same time as the irradiated age matched rats.     The rat’s movements were tracked with a series of 36 infra-red photocells which were analyzed by computer software (provided through Kinder Scientific with their standard Elevated Plus Maze platform).  One run was conducted per group.     At UMBC the rats were maintained on a 12:12 light: dark cycle. Food and water were continuously available. All procedures were approved by the UMBC and Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Lighting was provided by a string of rope lights attached to the underside of the open arms of the maze. In between rats, the maze was wiped down with alcohol.     A standard rat elevated plus maze with 43 cm arms extending from a 10 cm central area was obtained from Kinder Scientific. The arms of the maze were approximately 90 cm above the floor which was covered by foam rubber.     Each session was started by placing the rat in the central area facing the open arms of the maze and lasted 5 min (300 sec). The rats that were irradiated at 7 and 16 months of age were tested 4 months post-exposure; the rats that were irradiated at 2 and 12 months of age were tested 1 month after irradiation. For most experiments the level of activity (photocell breaks) will also be reported. Unfortunately, for this specific experiment that measure got lost in damaged software and cannot be recovered.     The data analyzed were: (1) total number of photocell breaks in order to obtain a measure of activity; (2) open arm time; and (3) percent open arm entries. Comparisons between specific groups following both types of ANOVAs were made using Fisher’s Least Significant Difference (LSD) statistic.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with an elevated plus maze data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all elevated plus maze results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.     The original submitted data was processed by the LBL/UCB Predictive Modeling Project funded by NASA (Senior investigators: Andy Wyrobek, Ana Mora and Ben Brown). Multiple emails were exchanged with Dr. Rabin (original study PI) to clarify any inconsistencies in dates, animal identifiers, and a few behavioral outcome values that were out of range or had been calculated incorrectly. Data sets were formatted so that they could be merged. These files also contain categories that are specific to the predictive modeling parameters used by the LBL/UCB team.

          "Study Description": "The aging process is characterized by a series of changes in neurochemical functioning and in motor and cognitive performance. In addition to changes in cognitive/behavioral performance, aged rats also show an increase in baseline anxiety measured using the elevated plus maze. Exposure to 56Fe particles, a component of cosmic rays, produces neurochemical and behavioral changes in young animals which are characteristic of aged organisms. The present study was designed to determine the relationships between aging and exposure to 56Fe particles on anxiety. Fischer 344 (F344) rats, which were 2, 7, 12, and 16 months of age at the time of irradiation, were exposed to 56Fe particles (50 to 200 cGy). Concordant with previous results, the oldest rats spent less time exploring the open arms of the maze. Exposure to 56Fe particles also produced decreased exploration of the open arms of the plus maze. The dose needed to produce increased levels of anxiety was a function of age at the time of irradiation. The dose of 56Fe particles needed to produce a decrease in open arm exploration was significantly lower in the rats that were irradiated at 7 and 12 months of age than in the rats irradiated at 2 months of age. These results suggest the possibility that exposing middle aged astronauts to cosmic rays during exploratory class missions outside the magnetosphere, and the resultant effects on exploration induced anxiety, may affect their ability to successfully complete mission requirements. This dataset derives results from the Elevated Plus Maze assay. The data derived from this study are from the behavioral assays Novel Object Recognition and Operant Conditioning (bar press).

          "Study Protocol Description": "This study was conducted in accordance with the National Research Council’s “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th Edition)”, at facilities of Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS) and Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), both of which are accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of both EVMS and BNL. The rats used in this study are a subset of the 90 male Wistar retired breeder rats (HSD:WI; Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc., Indianapolis, IN, USA) that were used in our previous study (Britten et al., 2018). The rats were delivered directly from the supplier to BNL, where they were group housed, maintained on a 12:12 light/dark cycle and given ad libitum access to autoclaved Purina Rodent Chow 5001 and municipal water by bottle. After at least one week of acclimatization, the rats were irradiated with 15 cGy 600 MeV/n 28Si exposure at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL).     After irradiation, the rats were implanted with ID-100us RFID transponders (Trovan Ltd, United Kingdom) to facilitate identification of individual animals. One week after irradiation, the rats were transported to EVMS, where they were group housed (2 per cage) and given ad libitum access to Teklad 2014 rat chow and municipal water by bottle. The rats were maintained on a reversed 12:12 light/dark cycle, i.e., lights were switched off during working hours, resulting in the rats being in their active phase when tested for spatial memory performance. Attentional Set Shifting Testing: At ~90 days post SR exposure the performance of the rats in the ATSET task was established according to our previously published protocol (Britten et al., 2018). The rodent ATSET task is a 7 stage progressive test, where the rat has to form an association between the presence of the food reward and a physical cue (either the digging medium or scent). By altering the combination of scents and digging media, progressively more complex cognitive processes can be tested. The task requires sequential rule learning ability, utilizing information gained in a previous stage to solve the subsequent tasks. The rats were given a total of 30 trials to reach criterion (six consecutive accurate choices) at each stage. Any rat that did not reach criterion, or that scored an incomplete (did not make a choice within 3 min on three out of five consecutive trials) in any given stage, was assigned a Day 1 test score of 30 attempts to reach completion (ATRC), rested overnight and retested the following day. If the rat reached criterion on the second occasion, the aggregate ATRC score (30 for the first failure plus the number of attempts on the second day) was recorded and the rats were immediately tested in the next stage of the assay. If the rat failed to complete a stage on the second attempt, it was excluded from further analysis. Rats are sequentially tested for performance in the SD, Compound Discrimination (CD), Compound Discrimination Reversal (CDR), Intra-Dimensional Shifting (IDS), IDS Reversal (IDR), Extra-Dimensional Shifting (EDS) and EDS Reversal (EDR) stages of the test. All testing was conducted during the dark cycle, with the first rat being tested at ~2 h into the 12 h dark cycle (Zeitgeber T+2). The time at which testing was commenced was kept constant for an individual rat. The ambient light within the testing room was only bright enough (4 Lux as determined by a Digital Lux Meter LX1330B (Kaysan Electronics, Mountain View, CA)) for the observation of the rats. After approximately a week from the completion of ATSET testing, rats were euthanized and the mPFC (along with several other brain regions) was recovered. Representative rats from each cohort (Sham n equals 5, SR-ATSET high performers (Functional) n equals 4 and SR-ATSET low performers (Impaired) n equals 3) were selected for proteomic analysis based upon their SD performance status. However, after completion of the proteomic analysis, the authors decided that while two of the SR-ATSET high performer rats were proficient in the SD stage, given the fact that they failed to complete later stages in the ATSET test, they needed to be reclassified as SR-ATEST low performers. To avoid inducing changes in the proteome of the mPFC due to anesthesia or asphyxiation, the rats were euthanized by guillotine. The brain was immediately recovered and the mPFC recovered in accordance with our previous protocol (Machida et al., 2010). The excised mPFC was placed in a sterile 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80oC until required for proteomic analysis.     The protocol followed for peptide and protein identification for the brain tissue lysate has been published in a previous paper (Britten et al., 2017; Dutta et al., 2018). The mPFC samples were recovered from cryopreservation, weighed and placed in impact resistant tubes containing 6.5 mm garnet and ceramic sphere matrix (MP Biomedical, Santa Ana, CA) with 1 ml of 8M urea, 300mM Tris-HCL, 10mM DTT (pH 8.5) per 100mg tissue sample. The sample was subjected to mechanical disruption in a FastPrep-24 instrument (MP Biomedical) for 20 s at a speed of 4m/s twice, the slurry was then centrifuged at 10,000xg for 10 min at 4°C and the supernatant transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using a DTT compatible BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) and 100 µg of extracted protein sample was run on a NuPAGE reducing gel (4-12% Bis-Tris Gel) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) with NuPAGE MOPS SDS 1X buffer run at 200V for about 10 min. After the protein band had migrated 3-5 mm, the gel was stained with Page Blue (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and the entire protein band cut out. The gel was de-stained and washed three times in 50mM NH4HCO3; 50% acetonitrile and 80% acetonitrile. The gel-bound proteins were reduced with 1 ml of 40mM DTT for 25 min. at 56°C. The gels were rinsed with 1 ml of 50mM NH4HCO3 buffer and the reduced proteins alkylated with 1ml of 50mM Iodoacetamide for 30 min. at 25°C in the dark with constant mixing. The Iodoacetamide was discarded and the gel bound proteins were digested with 0.5 ml of trypsin (20 ng/µl; Promega, Madison, WI) in 50mM NH4HCO3 buffer at 37°C with constant mixing for 12 h. After digestion, the tryptic fraction was collected by washing the gels with 50mM NH4HCO3. The eluent containing the tryptic peptides was dried using a Speed-Vac apparatus at 30 oC (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then shipped to University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) on ice. Upon arrival they were stored at 4°C prior to downstream analysis.     Peptide mixtures were analyzed by nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) using a nano-LC chromatography system (UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano, Dionex), coupled on-line to a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) through a nanospray ion source (Thermo Scientific).  A trap and elute method was used. The trap column was a C18 PepMap100 (300 um X 5mm, 5 um particle size) from ThermoScientific. The analytical columns was an Acclaim PepMap 100 (75 um X 25 cm, Thermo Scientific). After equilibrating the column in 98% solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and 2% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (ACN)), the samples (1 µL in solvent A) were injected onto the trap column and subsequently eluted (400 nL/min) by gradient elution onto the C18 column as follows: isocratic at 2% B, 0-5 min; 2% to 45% B, 2-37 min; 45% to 90% B, 37-40 min; isocratic at 90% B, 40-45 min; 90% to 2%, 45-47 min; and isocratic at 2% B, 47-60 min.\nAll LC-MS/MS data were acquired using XCalibur, version 2.1.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in positive  ionization mode using a top speed data-dependent acquisition (DDA) method with a 3 sec cycle time. The survey scans (m/z 350-1500) were acquired in the Orbitrap at 120,000 resolution (at m/z equals 400) in profile mode, with a maximum injection time of 50 msec and an AGC target of 400,000 ions. The S-lens RF level was set to 60. Isolation was performed in the quadrupole with a 1.6 Da isolation window, and CID MS/MS acquisition was performed in profile mode using rapid scan rate with detection in the orbitrap (res: 35,000), with the following settings: parent threshold equals 5,000; collision energy equals 35%; maximum injection time 100 msec; AGC target 500,000 ions. Monoisotopic precursor selection (MIPS) and charge state filtering were on, with charge states included. Dynamic exclusion was used to remove selected precursor ions, with a +/- 10 ppm mass tolerance, for 60 sec after acquisition of one MS/MS spectrum. MS/MS spectra were extracted and charge state deconvoluted by Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Fisher, version 1.4.1.14). Deisotoping was not performed. All MS/MS spectra were searched against a Rat protein database (a total of 25,320 sequences) extracted from Swissprot (version 57) using taxonomy “Rattus”. Uniprot Murine database using Sequest. Searches were performed with a parent ion tolerance of 5 ppm and a fragment ion tolerance of 0.60 Da. Trypsin was specified as the enzyme, allowing for two missed cleavages. Fixed modification of carbamidomethyl (C) and variable modifications of oxidation (M) and deamidation (N and E).  Only those proteins that have greater than 2 peptides identified (or greater than 50% of protein covered by a single peptide) were included in the comparative quantitative analysis steps, and result in a correct protein identification probability of P less than 0.05. A label-free precursor ion detection method (Proteome Discoverer, version 1.4, Thermo Scientific) was used because of the accurate mass measurements on proteins/peptides with specific retention times on precursors/fragments within 5 ppm mass accuracy. These factors combine to afford protein/peptide identifications with high confidence and high sequence coverage. The Sequest algorithm, a search engine employed by Proteome Discoverer (version 1.4, Thermo Scientific) was used to identify peptides from the resulting MS/MS spectra by searching against the combined Rat protein database (a total of 25,320 sequences) extracted from Swissprot (version 57) using taxonomy “Rattus”. Searching parameters for parent and fragment ion tolerances was set as 15 ppm and 80 mmu for the QE, trypsin was set as the protease with a maximum of 2 missed cleavages. Only those proteins that have greater than 2 peptides identified (or  greater than 50% of protein covered by a single peptide) were included in the comparative quantitative analysis steps, and result in a correct protein identification probability of P less than 0.05.",

          "Study Description": "NASA's planned mission to Mars will result in astronauts being exposed to ~ 350 mSv/yr of Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR). A growing body of data from ground-based experiments indicates that exposure to space radiation doses (approximately those that astronauts will be exposed to on a mission to Mars) impairs a variety of cognitive processes, including cognitive flexibility tasks. Some studies report that 33% of individuals may experience severe cognitive impairment. Translating the results from ground-based rodent studies into tangible risk estimates for astronauts is an enormous challenge, but it would be germane for NASA to use the vast body of data from the rodent studies to start developing appropriate countermeasures, in the expectation that some level of space radiation (SR) -induced cognitive impairment could occur in astronauts. While some targeted studies have reported radiation-induced changes in the neurotransmission properties and/or increased neuroinflammation within space radiation exposed brains, there remains little information that can be used to start the development of a mechanism-based countermeasure strategy. In this study, we have employed a robust label-free mass spectrometry (MS) -based untargeted quantitative proteomic profiling approach to characterize the composition of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) proteome in rats that have been exposed to 15 cGy of 600 MeV/n 28Si ions. A variety of analytical techniques were used to mine the generated expression data, which in such studies is typically hampered by low and variable sample size. We have identified several proteins whose expression alters as a result of space radiation exposure, and a further subset of proteins differs in rats that have a high level of cognitive performance after SR exposure in comparison with those that have low performance levels. While this study has provided further insight into how SR impacts upon neurophysiology, and what adaptive responses can be invoked to prevent the emergence of SR-induced cognitive impairment, the main objective of this paper is to outline strategies that can be used by others to analyze sub-optimal data sets and to identify new information.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "To facilitate direct comparison of DIP-Seq data with gene expression data for the 2-week time point, RNA-Seq was used to profile transcription from the same animals used for the DIP-Seq experiments. For the 2-week time point, RNA was isolated using the NEBnext poly A selection kit (New England Biolabs).     For Illumina RNA-Seq library preparation, we used the NEBnext Ultra kit according to the manufacturers specifications (New England Biolabs).     Libraries were sequenced on the HiSeq. 2000 platform using a 50 bp single-end flow cell at the OHSU Massively Parallel Sequencing Shared Resource or the Oregon State University Center for Genome Research. Illumina real-time base-calling was used.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on Sept-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.3 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.3/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported into R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).     AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit  (Qiagen) was used according to manufacturer's protocol with validation by Nanodrop spectrometry (260/280 ratio threshold of 1.7 for DNA and 1.9 for RNA) and Qubit flourometry (Thermofisher). The DNA was sonicated using a Cole Parmer CPX-132 sonicator (75% amplitude, 3 × 10′) and polished using the DNA terminator end repair kit (Lucigen).     DNA fragments were A-tailed using Klenow exo- (Epicenter) and ligated to un-methylated HT TrueSeq indexed adapters and purified. The resulting purified DNA was denatured at 95 C, resuspended in 100 ul of DIP IP buffer, and immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of the highly specific 5-methylcytosine antibody (Eurogentec) or 2 ul of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (Active Motif) antibody and Dynal anti-mouse IgG beads. Beads were rinsed 7 times with IP buffer, eluted with 1% SDS at room temperature and the eluted DNA purified and subjected to limited amplification (~18 cycles).     Six-month-old C57BL/6 J male mice (n equals to 84 mice in total) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor Maine. The biological age of the mice was selected to be relevant to the biological age of astronauts during space missions. The mice were shipped from Jackson Laboratories to Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Upton, New York, and allowed to accommodate to the housing facility there for one week. Subsequently, the mice were irradiated with 1Gy of 150MeV protons or sham-irradiated (n equals to 42 mice/radiation dose). For irradiation, mice were individually loaded into 8×3×3 cm plastic square enclosures with air holes and placed in a foam fixture in the beam line of the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL). They were exposed to a rectangular beam of approximately 20 x 20 cm. The focused beam of high-energy was generated by the Booster accelerator at BNL and transferred to the experimental beam line at the NSRL facility. Dose calibration was performed so that the desired dose could be delivered. Sham-irradiated mice were placed into the plastic enclosures for the same amount of time as the irradiated mice. Mice were randomly assigned to the experimental groups. The week after the irradiation or sham-irradiation, the mice were shipped to Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) and were assigned to one of two time points (2 or 20 weeks; n equals to 42 mice/time point). Cognitive testing started two or twenty weeks following irradiation. Following cognitive testing, the mice were killed by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation.     The hippocampus of one hemibrain was dissected for DNA methylation and RNAseq analyses. The other hemibrain was processed for Arc mRNA and TET2 immunohistochemical analyses. All protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of OHSU and BNL and were in compliance with all Federal regulations. Each RNA-Seq and DIP-Seq library was constructed from a pool of two mouse hippocampi per radiation condition and 4 libraries were generated per condition for a total of 8 RNA-Seq libraries, 8 meDIP-Seq libraries, 8 hmcDIP-Seq libraries.",

          "Study Description": "The brain's response to radiation exposure is an important concern for patients undergoing cancer therapy and astronauts on long missions in deep space. We assessed whether this response is specific and prolonged and is linked to epigenetic mechanisms. We focused on the response of the hippocampus at early (2-weeks) and late (20-week) time points following whole body proton irradiation. We examined two forms of DNA methylation, cytosine methylation (5mC) and hydroxymethylation (5hmC). Impairments in object recognition, spatial memory retention, and network stability following proton irradiation were observed at the two-week time point and correlated with altered gene expression and 5hmC profiles that mapped to specific gene ontology pathways. Significant overlap was observed between DNA methylation changes at the 2 and 20-week time points demonstrating specificity and retention of changes in response to radiation. Moreover, a novel class of DNA methylation change was observed following an environmental challenge (i.e. space irradiation), characterized by both increased and decreased 5hmC levels along the entire gene body. These changes were mapped to genes encoding neuronal functions including postsynaptic gene ontology categories. Thus, the brain's response to proton irradiation is both specific and prolonged and involves novel remodeling of non-random regions of the epigenome.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "All chemicals were of the highest purity and all solvents were LC-MS grade. Internal standards used included debrisoquine sulfate and 4-nitrobenzoic acid. Metabolite extraction was performed based on previously published protocols (PMID: 32178829). Briefly, a small piece of ~10 mg of tissue was homogenized in methanol:water (v:v, 1:1) containing 30 um debrisoquine sulfate and 4 um 4-nitrobenzoic acid as internal standards. Samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was transferred to a clean tube. Acetonitrile:water (v:v, 1:1) was added to the pellet and the procedure repeated. The two supernatants were combined and vacuum dried with no heat. The dried samples were resuspended in methanol:water (v:v, 1:1), filtered through a 0.2 um sized filter, and transferred to a sample vial. Two ul of each sample were injected into an Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer Xevo G2 (Waters Corp).     Two μl of each sample were injected into an Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer Xevo G2 (Waters Corp). A BEH C18 1.7 μm column was used, maintained at 60C. Quality controls (QC) from pooled samples were injected every 19 samples. Chromatographic conditions used: Solvent A:\tWater+0.1% Formic acid, Solvent B:\tAcetonitrile+0.1% Formic acid, Solvent D: \tIPA/ACN 90/10+0.1%FA+10mM HCOONH4 Curve Initial 6, flow 0.4 mL/min. 0-0.5 min 97% (A) and 3% (B), 0.5-4 min 40% (A) and 60% (B), 4-8 min 2% (A) and 98% (B), 8-10 min 5% (B) and 95% (D), 10-11 min 25% (A) and 25% (B) and 50% (D), 11-13 min 97% (A) and 3% (B).     All data were acquired in MSE mode. Mass correction was achieved with intermittent injections of Leucine-Enkephalin as LockSpray. Other conditions include capillary voltage 3V, MSE function cone voltage 30V, source temperature 120C, desolvation temperature 500C, cone gas flow of 25 L/hr, desolvation gas of 1000 L/hr, and collision energy 6V.     Male C57BL/6 mice (8-10 wks old) were ordered from Charles River and shipped directly to Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). All studies received UTMB (protocol   1411064, approved 11/01/2014) and BNL (protocol   480, approved 02/05/2015) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approval. Both facilities are AAALAC accredited. Irradiations were performed at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) with established dosimetry methods.  γ irradiations with a 137Cs source were also performed at BNL. Mice (n of 4-5 per group) were total body irradiated with either 0.2 Gy of 16O (1 GeV/n), 0.2 Gy of 56Fe (600 MeV/n), 1 Gy 137Cs or sham irradiated (controls) and shipped to UTMB. Timed sacrifice was performed at 1, 2, and 4 months after exposure with weight of the mice recorded at the time of euthanasia which was performed with CO2 asphyxiation under standard humane conditions.     Spleen samples were flash frozen and stored at −80 ◦C until shipment to Georgetown University for metabolomic processing.",

Leaving the protection that Low Earth Orbit provides will unavoidably expose astronauts to higher cumulative doses of space radiation, in addition to other stressors, e.g. microgravity. Immune regulation is known to be impacted and it remains to be seen whether prolonged effects will be encountered in deep space that can have an adverse impact on health. In this study we investigated the effects in overall metabolism of three different low dose radiation exposures (γ-rays, 16O, and 56Fe) in spleen from male C57BL/6 mice at 1, 2, and 4 months after exposure. Forty metabolites were identified with significant enrichment in purine metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle, fatty acids, acylcarnitines, and amino acids. Early perturbations were more prominent in the γ irradiated samples, while longer term responses shifted towards the high energy particle effects. Regression analysis showed a positive correlation of fatty acids with time and negative association with γ-rays, while degradation of purines were positively associated with time. Taken together, there is a strong suggestion of mitochondrial implication and the possibility of long term effects in DNA repair and nucleotide pools following radiation exposure.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Rats were exposed to quadrupedal partial weight bearing (PWB) treatments by suspending the entire animal in a quadrudedal unloading apparatus (described in Mortreux et al., J Appl Physiol, 2018).  Treatments were based on mimicing the gravity experienced on Earth (100% weight bearing, PWB100) and Mars (40% weight bearing, PWB40) for 14 days.  Front limbs supported via custom-made jackets composed of commercially available rodent tether jacket combined with a back bra extender to provide a snug fit and adjustability for all animals in the study.  We inserted a 10-G insulated solid copper wire (Grainger, Lake Forest, IL) into a medical silicone sheath (Versilon, Saint-Gobain Ceramics and Plastics, Northboro, MA) and bent the coated wire into a double-L shape. To prevent abrasion within the inguinal region due to excessive grooming, the pelvic harness was wrapped with medical gauze and replaced as needed. The center of the harness, located above the spine, was held by an S-shaped stainless steel hook connected to the suspension device. The final component of the suspension apparatus consisted of stainless-steel chains connected with swivel clasps and arranged in a triangular shape. A 10-cm back rod made of PVC was used to prevent excessive bending of the chain and to provide stability to the overall device. The entire suspension device was secured with a key ring and a swivel clasp at the center of an aluminum rod located at the top of the cage, allowing free movement of the animals in the cage without any risk of tangling. Rats were singly housed in custom cages (described in Mortreux et al., J Appl Physiol, 2018). Rats were placed in their cages 48-24h prior baseline for acclimation. Rats had a 12:12 light phase cycle with lights on at 7 am and lights off at 7 pm.     Rats were euthanized with CO2 followed by cardiac puncture and dissected immediately. Dissection was performed within 10 minutes.     RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) following SOP  3.1-Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNa Mini with Qiagen RNase-Free DNase set. Homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 15-20 mg of tissue was weighed and immediately placed in 1.2 mL of the Buffer RLT solution. Tissue homogenization was performed using the Polytron Rotor Stator Homogenizer (Kinematica PT 1300 D) at 15 second intervals for a total of three intervals on an ice bath per the SOP  2.2-Tissue Homogenization using Polytron Rotor Stator Homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 minutes at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 uL RNAse-free H2O. Concentration for all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR kit following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following SOP 4.3-Quality Analysis of RNA Using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 System. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat 4456739, v92), Mix 1 or Mix 2, were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol. Protocol followed is SOP 5.2 Use of ERCC Spike-In Mixes and UMRR/UHRR Controls for Total RNA Sequencing. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     All samples were normalized to an input of 10ng of total RNA and added to the QIAseq UPX 3' Transcriptome kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) following SOP 5.4-QIAseq UPX 3' Transcriptome Library Preparation.  Sample RINs greater than 7.3.  Cell IDs, which are used to distinguish individual samples, are added to each sample during the RT step.  This allows samples to be pooled together after the RT step and cary out library preparation on a pool of samples as opposed to individual samples.  An input of 50ng of pooled cDNA was used to carry out library construction.  Library fragment size for this pool of samples is ~569 bp and was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following protocol SOP  6.3-Quality Analysis of Sequencing Libraries Using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit.  Final library concentration and pooled library concentration were measured by qPCR with the QuantSudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), following SOP 6.7-Sequencing Library Quantification using QIAseq Library Quant Assay.  Library quality control was determined by iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Asymmetric paired end (Read 1: 93bp, Index: 6pb, Read 2: 28bp). PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity.  Protocol followed is SOP  7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.     Raw data were generated as described in GL-DPPD-7108 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Raw_Data_Generation/UPX_kit_for_bulk_RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7108_Versions/GL-DPPD-7108.md). In short, cell IDs, used to distinguish individual samples, were extracted from fastq files containing reads from multiple samples using UMI-tools (version 1.1.1). Extracted cell IDs were used to demultiplex fastq files to create one fastq file per individual sample. Raw fastq files from individual samples were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.3 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.3/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Rattus norvegicus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version mRatBN7.2 (Rattus_norvegicus.mRatBN7.2.dna.toplevel.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Rattus_norvegicus.mRatBN7.2.107.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Rattus norvegicus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. The data were normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor*. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Rn.eg.db (version 3.15.0). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis.html report. *ERCC-normalized data are available upon request.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Eleven-week old, female C57Bl/6J mice were randomly assigned to hindlimb unloading (HLU) or normal weightbearing (Cont) (n equals to 8/group). The HLU group underwent hindlimb unloading for 7 days according to the previously published studies. In brief, under isoflurane anesthesia, the mouse tail was taped to a freely rotating harness connected to a wheel that moved along the central axis of the custom-made cage. The harness was adjusted such that the mouse could not touch its hind limbs to the floor or the walls of the cage. Mice were maintained on a 12/12 hour light/dark cycle, had ad libitum access to standard laboratory rodent chow and water, and were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation at the end of the experiment. All animal procedures were approved by and performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.     After cutting the ends of bones and flushing marrow with 10 ml phosphate-buffered saline, the cortical bone was placed in an Eppendorf tube and immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.     After cutting the ends of bones and flushing marrow with 10 ml phosphate-buffered saline, the cortical bone was placed in an Eppendorf tube and immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Subsequently, Trizol was added while the bone is maintained frozen in an eppendorf tube placed in a liquid nitrogen bath, homogenized in the same eppendorf tube with the Fastprep24 machine (MP Biomdicals), and subsequently total RNA was isolated and purified using manufacture recommendations for the PureLink RNA kit (Life Technologies). Using this isolation technique, we routinely obtain 3–6 ug per sample total RNA that has high quality RNA integrity numbers (RIN, Aigilent Technologies) greater than 7.5.     RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit (v2, Illumina, San Diego, CA) per manufacturer recommendations using 500 ng/sample total RNA.     Samples were multiplexed (n equals to 8 per lane) for sequencing on a HiSeq (Illumina) platform.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of Mus-musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.4/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F).

Karpen (PI) and Sylvain V. Costes (Co-PI).",
          "Study Protocol Description": "Isolation of primary fibroblast cells from mice ears: A total of 76 animals from 15 different strains were used in this study (10 CC strains - CC002, CC011, CC013, CC019, CC032, CC037, CC040, CC042, CC051, CC061 and 5 Reference strains - C57BL/6J, BALB/CByJ, B6C3F1, C3H/HeMsNrsf and CBA/CaJ). Mice ears were decontaminated by soaking them in 70% ethanol for 15 seconds and were let dry. Ears were cut in small pieces with sterilized scissors and were transferred in a falcon tube containing 3 mL of 50 U/mL collagenase (Gibco 17101-015-1g) in HBSS (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tubes were placed at 37C (waterbath) for 1 hour and were vortexed for 5 seconds every 15 minutes during this incubation. After incubation, the tubes were filled with Minimum Essential Media (MEM, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% v:v foetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1% v:v penicillin/streptomycine (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tubes were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was re-suspended in 2 mL of culture medium and transferred into a 6 well plate. Cells were incubated in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 and 3% O2. After 24 hours of incubation at 37C, the wells were rinsed and 2 mL fresh medium was added.  At passage 3, fibroblast cells were re-suspended in an appropriate freezing medium (90% FBS, 10% DMSO) at a concentration of 10^6 cells/mL and stored at -80C in a cryo 1C freezing container. The day after, cryo vials were transferred in liquid nitrogen tank until further use. This procedure was performed for each of the 76 different animals. On an average, cells from 3 males and 3 females for each strain were expanded and frozen for further characterization.     Irradiation procedure: Fibroblast cells were thawed at BNL (Brookhaven National Laboratory; NY, USA) or LBNL (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; CA, USA) and immediately aliquoted into 96 well plates, one well for each individual cell line (76 primary lines), with precise recording of each cell ID position in the plates. 10^4 cells were seeded in 96 well plates (IBIDI microplate, IBIDI, Germany) and incubated at 37C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 and 3% O2.  Medium was replaced two hours before exposure of each plate. Cells were exposed to three different LET (350 MeV/n Si, 350 MeV/n Ar and 600 MeV/n Fe with 63, 104 and 170 keV/um LET respectively) and two ion fluences (1.1 and 3 particles per cell) at BNL. Since irradiation with each of the ions took place on different days, the confluency of the cells varied considerably. While for the Si run, 30% confluency was observed, the later experiments utilized higher cell plating density and 90% (Fe) and 80% (Ar) confluent cells were used for the Fe and Ar runs. For each run, two plates for each radiation condition (including control) were used, resulting in 64 plates for the high-LET experiments. Two fluences were used for all three ions and plates were thus exposed to 6 different doses given their different LETs (i.e. 0.30 Gy and 0.82 Gy for 600 MeV/n Fe; 0.18 Gy and 0.50 Gy for 350 MeV/n Ar; 0.11 and 0.30 Gy for 350 MeV/n Si). Also, each plates were exposed with the beam hitting below the plates, with the plate being angled at less than 5 degree, generating clear distinct track in the dish. Both for X-ray and ion exposure, dose rate was at 1Gy/min. X-ray experiments were conducted at LBNL on a 160 kVp Faxitron X-ray machine. After irradiation, cells were fixed at 4, 8, 24 and 48 hours post-exposure with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, PA, USA) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature followed by extensive washing (three washes with PBS for 5 min each). Plates were then sealed with parafilm and kept at 4C before being shipped to LBNL with cold pack. Group ID is based on the radiation group: Group 1 are Si, Group 2 are Ar, Group 3 are Fe, and Group 4 are X-ray.     Genomic DNA was extracted from each cell lines using AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, #80204). The concentration and purity of extracted DNA was determined using a NanoDrop 2000 UV-vis spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) by measuring the 260 nm/280 nm and 260 nm/230 nm ratios. All DNA samples contained a minimal concentration of 20 ng/uL and were shipped to GeneSeek (Neogen Genomics, Lincoln, NE, USA).  Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis was conducted using MegaMouse Universal Genotyping Array (MegaMUGA platform). The original MUGA array was developed on Illumina Infinium platform in cooperation with Neogen Inc and contained 7851 SNP markers all spaced uniformly approximately ~325 kb across the mouse reference genome. The MegaMUGA SNP array that was used provided a 10-fold higher marker density than MUGA (77,808 markers) and additional 14,000 probes detecting variants segregating in wild-derived strains. The collaborative-cross genotypes were obtained from the GigaMUGA database.     Our GWAS study consisted of analyzing two main phenotypes: Background (BGD) and FociPerGray (FPG).   BGD (spontaneous DNA damage) phenotype was defined as average number of 53BP1+ foci per nucleus in the control group (sham irradiation), averaged per mouse strain, assessed at 4 different time points: 4h, 8h, 24h and 48h for all three radiation qualities, averaged across all analyses after removing statistical outliers (values lower than 2 standard deviations below the mean or higher than 2 standard deviations above the mean).   FPG (radiation-induced DNA damage) phenotype was defined as the average increase in 53BP1+ foci per nucleus, per 1 Gy of irradiation. The FPG phenotype was quantified for X-rays and HZE particles (350MeV/n 40Ar, 600MeV/n 56Fe), averaged per mouse strain, separately for each radiation quality and time point.  We analyzed the significance of SNP-phenotype associations using Mann-Whitney test followed by Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons.  We used permutations of the phenotype vector that provide a null distribution to set rational thresholds that were calculated to be ~10-6.5 for FPG and ~10-5 for Background phenotypes and generally match thresholds utilized in previously published GWAS using CC mice. Pathway-phenotype associations were analyzed using Reactome database, which applies the Binomial test followed by Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment for multiple comparisons .     R packages gridExtra,  ggbio, biovizBase, GenomicRanges and rtracklayer were used for analysis. Spontaneous DNA damage (BGD) phenotype was defined as the average number of 53BP1+ foci per nucleus in the control group (sham irradiation) per strain, assessed at 4 different time points: 4, 8, 24 and 48 h for all three radiation qualities, averaged across all analyses after removing statistical outlier values for each strain (2 standard deviations above or below the mean for each strain). FPG (radiation-induced DNA damage) phenotype was defined as the average increase in 53BP1+ foci per nucleus, per 1 Gy of irradiation. FPG phenotype was quantified in response to irradiation by X-rays and HZE particles (350 MeV/n 40Ar, 600 MeV/n 56Fe), averaged per mouse strain, separately for each radiation quality and time point.  SNP-phenotype associations was determined using the Mann-Whitney test followed by permutations of the phenotype vector that provide a null distribution to set rational thresholds that were calculated to be ~10E-6.5 for FPG and ~10E-5 for BGD phenotypes. Bioconductor package EnsDb.Mmusculus.v79 was used to retrieve gene annotations and fgsea was used for pathway analysis     For immunostaining of the repair protein 53BP1 to quantify DNA double strand breaks (DSB), cells were first washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X for 20 minutes and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 hour. Cells were then incubated in a rabbit polyclonal anti-53BP1 primary antibody (Bethyl Labs #IHC-00001) at 1:400 in blocking buffer for 1 hour, followed by 2 washes in 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS and subsequent incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (ThermoFisher Scientific #A11034) at 1:400 in blocking buffer for 1 hour, followed by 2 washes in 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS. Finally, nuclear staining was performed with DAPI at 1:1000 in PBS for 5 minutes (ThermoFisher Scientific, #D1306), followed by 2 final washes in 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS and resuspension in PBS. After staining, cells were imaged and quantified using a high-throughput semi-automated microscope developed in-house by our group, and the images were analyzed using an automated foci quantification MATLAB algorithm. The automated foci quantification was set at a target of at least 800 cells per well based on previous publications.",

          "Study Description": "This study analyzes the variability of responses to simulated deep space radiation among 15 commonly used mouse strains. Ex vivo primary skin fibroblast responses to high mass-high charge particles and X-rays were analyzed by quantifying DNA damage-sensing protein 53BP1 positive radiation-induced foci (RIF) as a surrogate biomarker of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Primary skin fibroblasts were isolated from 10 collaborative cross strains and five reference inbred mice (C57Bl/6, BALB/CByJ, B6C3, C3H and CBA/CaJ) and exposed to 350 MeV/n Ar and 600 MeV/n Fe particles as well as X-rays. Our results indicate that nearby DSBs coalesced into repair units characterized by large RIFs. Such model has the advantage of being much more efficient molecularly, but is poorly suited to deal with cosmic radiation, where energy is concentrated along the particle trajectory. Thus, we observed a large density of DSBs along each particle track and the percentage of unrepaired DSBs that increased with linear energy transfer of the particle over 48 hours post irradiation. Furthermore, persistent RIF levels ex vivo were well correlated with T and B lymphocyte survival in vivo in 10 collaborative cross strains 24 hours after 0.1 Gy whole-body dose of X-rays, suggesting that persistent RIFs might serve as an ex vivo biomarker for in vivo radiation toxicity. Finally, we performed genome-wide association study to identify the genomic associations with dose responses to ionizing radiation, marked as Foci per Gray (FPG), as well as with background DNA repair levels (BGD). This dataset includes GWAS data as well as FPG and BGD values for each sample and condition.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "miRNA extractions from liver tissues were carried out using the Qiagen miRNeasy kit (#217184). Quantitation of miRNA samples was done using a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). The total RNA quality and quantity were analyzed using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, CA, USA) with RIN number > 7.     Approximately 1 ug of total RNA was used to prepare small RNA library according to protocol of TruSeq Small RNA Sample Prep Kits (Illumina, San Diego, USA).     Single-end sequencing was performed using 50 bp on an Illumina Hiseq 2500 at the LC Sciences (Hangzhou, China) following the vendor's recommended protocol.     15-week +/- 3-day old, C57Bl/6J wildtype (Wt) female mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and housed at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL, Upton, NY). Upon arrival to BNL, mice were quarantined and acclimated to a standard 12:12h light:dark cycle, with controlled temperature/humidity for 1-week prior to cage acclimation. Food and water were given ad libitum, and standard bedding was changed once per week. Mice were cage acclimated (n=10 mice per group; 2 mice per cage to maintain social interaction) 3-days prior to HU, followed by 14-days either normally loaded (NL) or hindlimb unloaded (HU, see details below). Irradiation was administered on day 13 and blood tissues were collected at 24-hours post-irradiation and post-euthanasia by CO2 overdose, followed by cervical dislocation. Blood was collected via the abdominal aorta in EDTA-coated tubes (0.5 M) and plasma was separated by centrifugation at 2,000xg for 15 minutes. Plasma was collected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for -80 C storage. A 100 ul aliquot of cellular fraction was flash frozen and stored at -80C for RNA analyses. The heart, liver, and soleus muscle were flash frozen and collected at the time of dissection. All tissues were stored at -80C. Body weight tracking was performed on days -3, 0, 7 and 14. Hindlimb unloading (HU) was performed using the adjusted Morey-Holton method for social housing (n=2 per cage) (Tahimic et al., 2019). Briefly, mice were suspended from the tail using non-invasive traction tape attached to an adjustable pulley mounted on the top of a standard rodent cage. The adjustable nature of the device allows the user to position the animal in a head-down position (approximately 30 degrees to the horizon) once attached. The crossbar height, lateral crossbar position, and chain length are adjustable. The pulley is free to move along the crossbar that spans the length of the top of the cage enabling the mouse to navigate freely on one half of the cage using its forepaws and to interact with the second mouse in the cage, without enabling ambulation of the limbs. Individual food and water sources are provided to each mouse and replaced daily. Control mice were housed in identical cages with normal ambulation.     On day 13, mice were transported on BNL base to the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) facility by animal care staff and were transferred to individual HU boxes. The following doses of irradiation were administered; simplified GCR sim (0.5 Gy), SPE (1 Gy), Gamma (5 Gy) and Sham control (0 Gy). Mice were positioned in the plateau region of the Bragg curve and irradiated at room temperature in individual HU boxes to enable whole body irradiation while maintaining hindlimb suspension. The NSRL physics staff performed the dosimetry. To simulate GCR, we used the simplified GCR simulation of ions, energy, and doses determined by a NASA consensus formula  that consists of 5 ions: protons at 1000 MeV, 28Si at 600 MeV/n, 4He at 250 MeV/n, 16O at 350 MeV/n, 56Fe at 600 MeV/n, and protons at 250 MeV. This dose of radiation is equivalent to what an astronaut is predicted to receive in deep space during a Mars mission, though it is modeled as a single exposure over 25 minutes instead of the actual chronic exposures over 1.5 years. Further, GCR sim is a mixture of high and low LET ions in a ratio of 15% to 85%, respectfully. To simulate SPE, we used a total dose of 1Gy protons with energy ranges from 50MeV to 150MeV. For all irradiations a 60x60 beam was utilized at NSRL. For radiation dose equivalence and biological reference, we used 5 Gy gamma irradiation with the cesium resource available at BNL, in the absence of HU due to resource limitations. Sham controls were treated similar to GCR/SPE irradiated mice, including HU cage boxes and beam line (without irradiation) for the same duration as GCR simualtion, i.e. 25 minutes. NSRL GCR and SPE simulations are designed to approximate the chronic mixed field exposures in space by means of sequential acute exposures to a variety of ion/energy combinations. The exposure protocols are on the NSRL website: https://www.bnl.gov/nsrl/userguide/simgcrsim.php (SimGCRSim) and https://www.bnl.gov/nsrl/userguide/SPE-simulation.php (SPESim). The dose can be administered either in a single series of exposures lasting approximately an hour or in daily fractions over several weeks. The GCR simulations are described in detail here: Simonsen LC, Slaba TC, Guida P, Rusek A (2020) NASA's first ground-based Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: Enabling a new era in space radiobiology research. PLoS Biol 18(5): e3000669. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000669. GeneLab calculated exposure duration of gamma irradiation based on absorbed radiation dose and dose rate.     Irradiation was administered on day 13 and blood was collected at 24-hours post-irradiation and post-euthanasia by CO2 overdose, followed by cervical dislocation. The heart, liver, and soleus muscle were flash frozen and collected at the time of dissection. All tissues were stored at -80C.",

          "Managing NASA Center": "",
          "Study Description": "Biological risks associated with space radiation and microgravity are major concerns for long-term space travel. Through a Systems Biology approach, our previous NASA work has shown both TGFβ signaling pathways and miRNAs have a critical impact on defining health risks with and without space irradiation. We hypothesize that circulating microRNA (miRNA) signatures are driving microvascular disease and muscle degeneration associated with accelerating aging and will be enhanced by exposure to the space environment (radiation and microgravity). We investigated this hypothesis both in vivo and in vitro and test novel antagonist therapies to these miRNA signatures as countermeasures to reduce space radiation-induced health risks. A comprehensive Systems Biology approach was used to examine the influence by high atomic number by high (H) atomic number (Z) and energy (E) (HZE) irradiation. To simulate low-dose exposure due to galactic cosmic rays (GCR), we used the ions, energy, and doses determined by a NASA consensus formula of 7 different ions to represent GCR (referred to as GCR sim model). To simulate high-dose radiation exposure due to solar particle events (SPE), we used an acute dose of SPE simulated beam at 1Gy which has energies ranging from 50MeV to 150MeV. C57BL/6 wild-type mice were utilized for irradiation with our established simulated microgravity model (hindlimb suspension model) and an in vitro 3D microvasculature tissue model under simulated microgravity (clinostat) conditions will also be irradiated. To expand on the circulating miRNA signature determined from our preliminary data, we determined a group of conserved miRNAs which are commonly being regulated in the majority of the organs and tissues throughout the host using our established techniques. MiRNA-sequencing on serum (before IR and at time of sacrifice), liver, heart, and muscle tissue for all radiation groups revealed the key circulating miRNA signature (consisting of multiple miRNAs) impacting disease risk. Collectively, understanding of how whole body space radiation impacts microvascular and tissue degeneration through circulating miRNAs will greatly enhance health risk prognostication and provide possible new mechanisms for protection against space radiation.",

Sham controls were treated similar to GCR/SPE irradiated mice, including HU cage boxes and beam line (without irradiation) for the same duration as GCR simualtion, i.e. 25 minutes. NSRL GCR and SPE simulations are designed to approximate the chronic mixed field exposures in space by means of sequential acute exposures to a variety of ion/energy combinations. The exposure protocols are on the NSRL website: https://www.bnl.gov/nsrl/userguide/simgcrsim.php (SimGCRSim) and https://www.bnl.gov/nsrl/userguide/SPE-simulation.php (SPESim). The dose can be administered either in a single series of exposures lasting approximately an hour or in daily fractions over several weeks. The GCR simulations are described in detail here: Simonsen LC, Slaba TC, Guida P, Rusek A (2020) NASA's first ground-based Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: Enabling a new era in space radiobiology research. PLoS Biol 18(5): e3000669. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000669. GeneLab calculated exposure duration of gamma irradiation based on absorbed radiation dose and dose rate.     Irradiation was administered on day 13 and blood was collected at 24-hours post-irradiation and post-euthanasia by CO2 overdose, followed by cervical dislocation. The heart, liver, and soleus muscle were flash frozen and collected at the time of dissection. All tissues were stored at -80C.",

          "Study Description": "Biological risks associated with space radiation and microgravity are major concerns for long-term space travel. Through a Systems Biology approach, our previous NASA work has shown both TGFβ signaling pathways and miRNAs have a critical impact on defining health risks with and without space irradiation. We hypothesize that circulating microRNA (miRNA) signatures are driving microvascular disease and muscle degeneration associated with accelerating aging and will be enhanced by exposure to the space environment (radiation and microgravity). We investigated this hypothesis both in vivo and in vitro and test novel antagonist therapies to these miRNA signatures as countermeasures to reduce space radiation-induced health risks. A comprehensive Systems Biology approach was used to examine the influence by high atomic number by high (H) atomic number (Z) and energy (E) (HZE) irradiation. To simulate low-dose exposure due to galactic cosmic rays (GCR), we used the ions, energy, and doses determined by a NASA consensus formula of 7 different ions to represent GCR (referred to as GCR sim model). To simulate high-dose radiation exposure due to solar particle events (SPE), we used an acute dose of SPE simulated beam at 1Gy which has energies ranging from 50MeV to 150MeV. C57BL/6 wild-type mice were utilized for irradiation with our established simulated microgravity model (hindlimb suspension model) and an in vitro 3D microvasculature tissue model under simulated microgravity (clinostat) conditions will also be irradiated. To expand on the circulating miRNA signature determined from our preliminary data, we determined a group of conserved miRNAs which are commonly being regulated in the majority of the organs and tissues throughout the host using our established techniques. MiRNA-sequencing on serum (before IR and at time of sacrifice), liver, heart, and muscle tissue for all radiation groups revealed the key circulating miRNA signature (consisting of multiple miRNAs) impacting disease risk. Collectively, understanding of how whole body space radiation impacts microvascular and tissue degeneration through circulating miRNAs will greatly enhance health risk prognostication and provide possible new mechanisms for protection against space radiation.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "miRNA extractions from heart tissues were carried out using the Qiagen miRNeasy kit (#217184). Quantitation of miRNA samples was done using a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). The total RNA quality and quantity were analyzed using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, CA, USA) with RIN number > 7.     Approximately 1 ug of total RNA was used to prepare small RNA library according to protocol of TruSeq Small RNA Sample Prep Kits (Illumina, San Diego, USA).     Single-end sequencing was performed using 50 bp on an Illumina Hiseq 2500 at the LC Sciences (Hangzhou, China) following the vendor's recommended protocol.     15-week +/- 3-day old, C57Bl/6J wildtype (Wt) female mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and housed at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL, Upton, NY). Upon arrival to BNL, mice were quarantined and acclimated to a standard 12:12h light:dark cycle, with controlled temperature/humidity for 1-week prior to cage acclimation. Food and water were given ad libitum, and standard bedding was changed once per week. Mice were cage acclimated (n=10 mice per group; 2 mice per cage to maintain social interaction) 3-days prior to HU, followed by 14-days either normally loaded (NL) or hindlimb unloaded (HU, see details below). Irradiation was administered on day 13 and blood tissues were collected at 24-hours post-irradiation and post-euthanasia by CO2 overdose, followed by cervical dislocation. Blood was collected via the abdominal aorta in EDTA-coated tubes (0.5 M) and plasma was separated by centrifugation at 2,000xg for 15 minutes. Plasma was collected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for -80 C storage. A 100 ul aliquot of cellular fraction was flash frozen and stored at -80C for RNA analyses. The heart, liver, and soleus muscle were flash frozen and collected at the time of dissection. All tissues were stored at -80C. Body weight tracking was performed on days -3, 0, 7 and 14.  Hindlimb unloading (HU) was performed using the adjusted Morey-Holton method for social housing (n=2 per cage) (Tahimic et al., 2019). Briefly, mice were suspended from the tail using non-invasive traction tape attached to an adjustable pulley mounted on the top of a standard rodent cage. The adjustable nature of the device allows the user to position the animal in a head-down position (approximately 30 degrees to the horizon) once attached. The crossbar height, lateral crossbar position, and chain length are adjustable. The pulley is free to move along the crossbar that spans the length of the top of the cage enabling the mouse to navigate freely on one half of the cage using its forepaws and to interact with the second mouse in the cage, without enabling ambulation of the limbs. Individual food and water sources are provided to each mouse and replaced daily. Control mice were housed in identical cages with normal ambulation.     On day 13, mice were transported on BNL base to the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) facility by animal care staff and were transferred to individual HU boxes. The following doses of irradiation were administered; simplified GCR sim (0.5 Gy), SPE (1 Gy), Gamma (5 Gy) and Sham control (0 Gy). Mice were positioned in the plateau region of the Bragg curve and irradiated at room temperature in individual HU boxes to enable whole body irradiation while maintaining hindlimb suspension. The NSRL physics staff performed the dosimetry. To simulate GCR, we used the simplified GCR simulation of ions, energy, and doses determined by a NASA consensus formula  that consists of 5 ions: protons at 1000 MeV, 28Si at 600 MeV/n, 4He at 250 MeV/n, 16O at 350 MeV/n, 56Fe at 600 MeV/n, and protons at 250 MeV. This dose of radiation is equivalent to what an astronaut is predicted to receive in deep space during a Mars mission, though it is modeled as a single exposure over 25 minutes instead of the actual chronic exposures over 1.5 years. Further, GCR sim is a mixture of high and low LET ions in a ratio of 15% to 85%, respectfully. To simulate SPE, we used a total dose of 1Gy protons with energy ranges from 50MeV to 150MeV. For all irradiations a 60x60 beam was utilized at NSRL. For radiation dose equivalence and biological reference, we used 5 Gy gamma irradiation with the cesium resource available at BNL, in the absence of HU due to resource limitations.

          "Study Description": "Biological risks associated with space radiation and microgravity are major concerns for long-term space travel. Through a Systems Biology approach, our previous NASA work has shown both TGFβ signaling pathways and miRNAs have a critical impact on defining health risks with and without space irradiation. We hypothesize that circulating microRNA (miRNA) signatures are driving microvascular disease and muscle degeneration associated with accelerating aging and will be enhanced by exposure to the space environment (radiation and microgravity). We investigated this hypothesis both in vivo and in vitro and test novel antagonist therapies to these miRNA signatures as countermeasures to reduce space radiation-induced health risks. A comprehensive Systems Biology approach was used to examine the influence by high atomic number by high (H) atomic number (Z) and energy (E) (HZE) irradiation. To simulate low-dose exposure due to galactic cosmic rays (GCR), we used the ions, energy, and doses determined by a NASA consensus formula of 7 different ions to represent GCR (referred to as GCR sim model). To simulate high-dose radiation exposure due to solar particle events (SPE), we used an acute dose of SPE simulated beam at 1Gy which has energies ranging from 50MeV to 150MeV. C57BL/6 wild-type mice were utilized for irradiation with our established simulated microgravity model (hindlimb suspension model) and an in vitro 3D microvasculature tissue model under simulated microgravity (clinostat) conditions will also be irradiated. To expand on the circulating miRNA signature determined from our preliminary data, we determined a group of conserved miRNAs which are commonly being regulated in the majority of the organs and tissues throughout the host using our established techniques. MiRNA-sequencing on serum (before IR and at time of sacrifice), liver, heart, and muscle tissue for all radiation groups revealed the key circulating miRNA signature (consisting of multiple miRNAs) impacting disease risk. Collectively, understanding of how whole body space radiation impacts microvascular and tissue degeneration through circulating miRNAs will greatly enhance health risk prognostication and provide possible new mechanisms for protection against space radiation.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Serum miRNA microarrays were performed using three pooled control samples and four pooled HU samples (each pool was composed of four individual serum samples with the same volume). miRNA microarray was performed by Oebiotech (Shanghai, China). RNA was extracted by mirVana PARIS Kit (Applied Biosystem p/n AM1556) according to the manufacturer's instructions and qualitified by NanoDrop ND2000 (Thermo Scientific) Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent).     Cyanine-3(Cy3) labeled cRNA was prepared from 0.2ug RNA using for the One-Color low RNA Inpiut Linear Amplification PLUS Kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by RNAeasy column purification (Qiagen, Valencia Ca). Dye incorporation and cRNA yield were checked with the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer.     0.6 ug of Cy3-labelled purified miRNA was added with Hyb Spike-in, 10X GE Blocking agent and Hi-RPM Hydridizaiton buffer in the total reaction volume of 45uL, followed with 100C incubation for 5 minutes and ice water bath for 5 minutes. Then the mixture reaction was hybridized to Agilent Rat miRNA (8*60K) for 20 hours at 55°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 5 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 2 (Agilent) and 5 minute with 37C GE Wash buffer 3 (Agilent), then dried immediately by brief centrifugation.     Slides were scanned immediately after washing on the Agilent Microarray Scanner G2505C (Agilent) using one color scan setting (Scan Area 61x21.6 mm, Scan resolution 5um, Dye channel is set to Green and Green PMT is set XDR Hi 100% and XDR Lo 10%).     The protocol of all animal experiments was approved by the Animal Care Committee of China Astronaut Research and Training Center. All the processes were according to the institutional guidelines for laboratory animals and adhered to standard biosecurity and institutional safety procedures. A total of 72 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats aged 7 weeks were purchased from the Animal Center of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences (Beijing, China) and housed at the Institutional Animal Care Facility of the China Astronaut Research and Training Center. SD rats have time to acclimatize to their new surroundings for 1 week separately before normal experiments, given free access to water and standard chow under a 12:12 h light/dark cycle.  For the simulated microgravity experiments, 60 male rats were randomly assigned to the control group (n = 30) or the hindlimb unloading treatment (HU) group for different days (n = 30). Mice were maintained one per cage. The HU manipulation was performed as Wronski described previously (Wronski and Morey-Holton, 1987) with minor modifications. Briefly, the rat was suspended by the tail attached to a chain hanging from a beam using a strip of adhesive surgical tape. The bodies of rats were at a 30-degree angle to the floor, with only the forelimbs touching the floor and allowed to freely move to food and water.     Rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (4 ml/kg) after hindlimb unloading for 28 days. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture and centrifuged at 2000 x g for 10 min at 4C, followed by 20 min high-speed centrifugation at 12,000 x g at 4C to completely remove cell debris. The whole process was accomplished within 2 h and the supernatant serum was stored at −80C until analysis.",

          "Managing NASA Center": "",
          "Study Description": "Microgravity impacts various aspects of human health. Yet the mechanisms of spaceflight-induced health problems are not elucidated. Here we mapped the fusion systemic analysis of the serum metabolome and the circulating microRNAome in a hindlimb unloading rat model to simulate microgravity. The response of serum metabolites and microRNAs to simulated microgravity (SMG) was striking. Integrated pathway analysis of altered serum metabolites and target genes of the significantly altered circulating miRNAs with Integrated Molecular Pathway-Level Analysis (IMPaLA) software was mainly suggestive of modulation of neurofunctional signaling pathways. Particularly, we revealed significantly increased miR-383-5p and decreased aquaporin 4 (AQP4) - in the hippocampus. Utilizing Rabies Virus Glycoprotein (RVG)-modified exosomes, delivery of miR-383-5p inhibited the expression of AQP4 not only in rat C6 glioma cells in vitro but also in the hippocampus in vivo. Using bioinformatics to map the crosstalk between the circulating metabolome and miRNAome could offer opportunities to understand complex biological systems under microgravity. Our present results suggested that the change of miR-383-5p level and its regulation of target gene AQP4 was one of the potential molecular mechanisms of microgravity induced cognitive impairment in the hippocampus. MiRNA plays an important role during the adaptation to microgavity. In this study, effects of simulated microgravity on circulating microRNA profiles were performed to screen different expression miRNA and gravity-sensitive miRNAs. To investigate the influence of simulated microgravity on the circulating miRNAome, the male SD rats were randomly assigned to the control group or the hindlimb unloading group to simulated microgravity for 28 days under 12hr light/12hr dark schedule. Total miRNA was extracted form Serum and used for miRNA microarray analysis with 3 pooled control samples and 4 pooled Hindlimb suspension simulated microgravity samples (each pool was composed of 4 individual serum samples with the same volume).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Mice with a homozygous deletion of Parp1 (129S-Parp1tm1Zqw/J, referred to henceforth as Parp1–/–) and the corresponding 129S wild-type strain were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred at Georgetown University (Washington, DC). All mouse work was conducted at Georgetown University under Protocol 13-003 approved by the Georgetown University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and in accord with NIH guidelines. The animals had access to food and water ad libitum and were maintained with a standard 12 h light/dark cycle.\n\nMale mice at 8–10 weeks of age were exposed to approximately LD50/30 137Cs gamma rays, corresponding to 6 Gy for the Parp1–/–animals and 8.8 Gy for the WT mice. The dose rate was approximately 1.67 Gy/min. A second group of WT animals were also exposed to 6 Gy, and for both genotypes a group of control animals were sham irradiated. Cesium-137 produces gamma rays with an energy of 0.662 MeV and has a half-life of 30.1 years. Ionizing radiation energy values were added by GeneLab.     At 24 h postirradiation animals were sacrificed, and blood was collected by cardiac puncture into PAXgene™ blood RNA stabilization solution (PreAnalytiX; QIAGEN®, Valencia, CA). After mixing thoroughly, the samples were stored at –80°C prior to shipping to Columbia University (New York, NY) for RNA analysis.     RNA was purified following the PAXgene RNA kit recommendations with on-column DNase I treatment, followed by globin reduction using GLOBINclear-Mouse/Rat.     Cyanine-3 (Cy3) labeled cRNA was prepared from 0.2 ug RNA using the One-Color Low RNA Input Linear Amplification PLUS kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by RNAeasy column purification (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). Dye incorporation and cRNA yield were checked with the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer.     1.5 ug of Cy3-labelled cRNA (specific activity >10.0 pmol Cy3/ug cRNA) was fragmented at 60C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 250 µl containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturers instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 250 ml of 2x Agilent hybridization buffer was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to Agilent Whole Mouse Genome Oligo Microarrays 4X44K v2 (G4846A) for 17 hours at 65C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately by brief centrifugation.     Slides were scanned immediately after washing on the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2505B) using one color scan setting for 4x44k v.2 array slides (Scan Area 61x21.6 mm, Scan resolution 10um, Dye channel is set to Green and Green PMT is set to 100%).     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7112 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Agilent_1-channel/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7112_Versions/GL-DPPD-7112.md), using NF_MAAgilent1ch version 1.0.3 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAgilent1ch_1.0.3/Microarray/Agilent_1-channel/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAgilent1ch). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.1). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3). Raw data quality assurance density, pseudo image, MA, and foreground-background plots were generated using limma (version 3.50.3), and boxplots were generated using ggplot2 (version 3.4.0). The raw intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the limma (version 3.50.3) quantile method. Normalized data quality assurance density, pseudo image, and MA plots were generated using limma (version 3.50.3), and boxplots were generated using ggplot2 (version 3.4.0). Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probe using the Ensembl database ftp server (ensembl.org, release 107). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probe to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Managing NASA Center": "",
          "Study Description": "There is a current interest in the development of biodosimetric methods for rapidly assessing radiation exposure in the wake of a large-scale radiological event. The initial focus of this work has largely centered on determining the exposure dose to an individual using biological indicators. Gene expression signatures are showing promise for biodosimetric application, but little is known about how these signatures might translate for the assessment of radiological injury in radiosensitive individuals, who comprise a significant fraction of the general population, and who would likely require treatment following lower doses. Using Parp1-/- mice as a model radiation sensitive genotype, we have investigated the effect of this DNA repair deficiency on the gene expression response to radiation. Although Parp1 is known to play general roles in regulating transcription, the pattern of gene expression changes observed 24 h after exposure to a potentially lethal LD50 dose of radiation was remarkably similar in the two genotypes, and indicated similar levels of activation of both the p53 and NFκB radiation response pathways. In contrast, exposure of wild-type mice to a sub-lethal dose that was equal to the LD50 dose given to the Parp1-/- mice, resulted in a reduced gene expression response. Gene expression classifiers trained on the wild-type data correctly identified all wild-type samples as unexposed, exposed to a sub-lethal dose, or exposed to a potentially lethal dose. All unexposed samples from the Parp1-/- mice were also correctly classified, and 80% of the irradiated samples were identified as exposed to a potentially lethal dose. The results of this study suggest that, at least for some genotypes, gene expression has the potential to accurately detect the extent of radiological injury, rather than being useful only as a surrogate of physical radiation dose.",

These host mice were irradiated whole body at 10–12 weeks of age to the indicated dose at a rate of 23 cGy/min using 60Co γ-radiation.     80 ng of total RNA were used to prepare cRNA following the Affymetrix 3' IVT Express Kit labeling protocol     12.5 micrograms of fragmented cRNA was hybridized for 16 hr to the Affymetrix MG 430 2.0 arrays using GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 and Genechip fluidics station FS 450, following standard Affymetrix protocols.     Affymetrix GeneArray scanner 7G     Feature intensity was extracted by Affymetrix GeneChip Operating System as CEL files. The probe-level analysis of the CEL files was performed by the RMA algorithm using Agilent GeneSpring GX10 program. No further adjustments were made to the data in the table.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.5 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.5/Microarray/Affymetrix/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAffymetrix). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.4). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using oligo (version 1.58.0). Raw data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). The raw probe level intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the oligo (version 1.58.0) quantile method. Normalized probe level data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). Normalized probe level data was summarized to the probeset level using the oligo (version 1.58.0) RMA method. Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probeset using biomaRt (version 2.50.0), Ensembl database (ensembl.org, release 107). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probeset to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned for every probeset that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Description": "This is a genome-wide approach to identifying genes persistently induced in the mouse mammary gland by acute whole body low dose ionizing radiation (10cGy), 1 and 4 weeks after exposure. Gene expression that is modified under these parameters were compared between Tgfb1 wild type and heterozygote littermates in order to determine which genes induced or repressed by radiation were mediated via Tgfb1 status. Differential gene expression was analyzed in Tgfb1 heterozygote and wild type littermate 4th mammary glands, after whole body exposure to an acute dose of 10cGy ionizing radiation. Estrus cycle was normalized in all mice two days prior to irradiation by injection with an estrogen and progesterone mixture. It is widely believed that the carcinogenic action of ionizing radiation is due to targeted DNA damage and resulting mutations, but there is also substantial evidence that non-targeted radiation effects alter epithelial phenotype and the stromal microenvironment. Activation of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFbeta) is a non-targeted radiation effect that mediates cell fate decisions following DNA damage and regulates microenvironment composition; it could either suppress or promote cancer. Gene expression profiling shown herein demonstrates that low dose radiation (10 cGy) elicits persistent changes in Tgfb1 wild type and heterozygote murine mammary gland that are highly modulated by TGFbeta. We asked if such non-targeted radiation effects contribute to carcinogenesis by using a novel radiation chimera model. Unirradiated Trp53 null mammary epithelium was transplanted to the mammary stroma of mice previously exposed to a single low (10 -100 cGy) radiation dose. By 300 days, 100% of transplants in irradiated hosts at either 10 or 100 cGy had developed Trp53 null breast carcinomas compared to 54% in unirradiated hosts. Tumor growth rate was also increased by high, but not low, dose host irradiation. In contrast, irradiation of Tgfb1 heterozygote mice prior to transplantation failed to decrease tumor latency, or increase growth rate at any dose. Host irradiation significantly reduced the latency of invasive ductal carcinoma compared to spindle cell carcinoma, as well as those tumors negative for smooth muscle actin in wild type but not Tgfb1 heterozygote mice. However, irradiation of either host genotype significantly increased the frequency of estrogen receptor negative tumors. These data demonstrate two concepts critical to understanding radiation risks. First, non-targeted radiation effects can significantly promote the frequency and alter the features of epithelial cancer. Second, radiation-induced TGFbeta activity is a key mechanism of tumor promotion. Keywords: Differential gene expression after low dose irradiation Two genotypes: TGBbeta1 heterozygote and wildtype mouse mammary glands. Two time points post-10cGy-irradiation per genotype (1 week, 4 weeks); control time point was 1 week post-sham-irradiation. Two or three replicates per time point.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "C3H/HeNCrl mice purchased from Charles River (Wilmington, MA) were used in this experiment. Prior to euthanasia animals were weighed and weight recorded. Post euthanasia tissues of the left lobe of livers were collected, snap-frozen on either dry ice or liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until tissues could be extracted for RNA. Livers were sampled by taking two 40-micron thick slices using a cryotome at -20°C.     Serial sacrifice study consisted of 15 male mice with 3 mice per time point and five time-points consisting of 30, 60, 120, 270, and 360 days post-exposure to HZE: 56Fe, 16O, and 28Si irradiation. Additionally, 15 mice were used as controls resulting in a total of 60 eight to ten-week-old male mice for this study. The 3 treatment groups were: 600 MeV/n 56Fe (0.2 Gy), 1 GeV/n 16O (0.2 Gy), 350 MeV/n 28Si (0.2 Gy), and no irradiation. The mice were shipped from the vendor to Brookhaven National Laboratories (BNL) and housed at the BNL animal facility until the time of irradiation at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL). Following irradiation, the animals were shipped to the UTMB Animal Resources Center (ARC), quarantined for one month and then maintained in the ARC for the duration of the experiment. Animals were housed in sterile cages with free access to food and water. Facilities at both BNL and UTMB are fully AAALAC accredited which ensured adequacy of all animal care issues at both animal facilities. At each of the five time-points, 3 animals from each treatment group were randomly selected and euthanized by using CO2 asphyxiation as per current AVMA guidelines for euthanasia.     Total RNA was isolated from the liver slices using RNAqueousTM Total RNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).     rRNA was removed via Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) prior to library preparation with the Illumina TruSeq RNA Library kit.     Samples were sequenced in a paired-end 50 base format on an Illumina HiSeq 1500.     CLC Genomics Workbench v12.0.3 was used for bioinformatical analysis of the RNA-Seq data. Sequencing data was initially trimmed using the Trim Reads module. Reads containing nucleotides below the quality threshold of 0.05 (using the modified Richard Mott algorithm), those with two or more unknown nucleotides or sequencing adapters were trimmed out, 14 bases were trimmed from the 5' end of each read. Filtered sequencing reads were then processed using the RNA-Seq Analysis module. Reads were mapped using global alignment strategy against the mouse GRCm38 reference genome with 95% length fraction and similarity fraction scores with annotation version GRCm38.97.",

          "Study Description": "One of the health risks posed to astronauts during deep space flights is exposure to high charge, high-energy (HZE) ions (Z>13) which can lead to induction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We performed comparative RNA-Seq transcriptomic analysis to assess the carcinogenic effects of 600 MeV/n 56Fe (0.2 Gy), 1 GeV/n 16O (0.2 Gy), and 350 MeV/n 28Si (0.2 Gy) ions in a mouse model for radiation-induced hepatocellular carcinoma. C3H/HeNCrl mice were subjected to total body irradiation to simulate space HZE-irradiation environment and liver tissues were extracted at five different time points post-irradiation to investigate the time-dependent gradual carcinogenic response at the transcriptomic level. Our data demonstrated a clear difference in the effects of these HZE ions, particularly immunological, on the carcinogenic process of HCC, suggesting different molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Also seen in this study was novel unmapped transcripts that were significantly affected by HZE. To investigate the biological functions of these transcripts, we used a machine learning technique known as self-organizing maps (SOMs) to characterize the transcriptome expression profiles of 60 samples (45 HZE-irradiated, 15 non-irradiated control) from liver tissues. A handful of localized modules in the maps emerged as groups of co-regulated and co-expressed transcripts. The functional context of these modules was discovered using overrepresentation analysis. We found that these spots typically contained enriched populations of transcripts related to specific immunological molecular processes. Taken together, these findings not only led to a better understanding of biological mechanisms underlying risks for HCC after HZE irradiation but also have important implications for discovery of potential countermeasures and identification of biomarkers of HZE-induced HCC.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Mice were maintained under the following conditions: Temperature, 18-22C; humidity, 50-60%; 10-14 h light/dark cycle; ad libitum access to food and water. Superovulation of 20 adult female mice (C57BL/6; age, 6 to 12 weeks; weight, 18-25 g; Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center, Foshan, China) was induced via intraperitoneal injection of 5 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (Ningbo Second Hormone Factory, Ningbo, China), followed by injection of 5 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; Ningbo Second Hormone Factory) after 48 h. The mice were then placed in individual cages with an adult male mouse (C57BL/6; age, 8-24 weeks; weight, 20-50 g; Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center). The female mice were screened for vaginal plugs the following morning (15 h post-hCG), and mice with vaginal plugs were subsequently dissected for collect ion of their zygotes. A total of 16 h following hCG administration, the zygotes were collected from the ampullae of the oviducts, and the cumulus cells were removed with 300 IU/ml hyaluronidase. The zygotes were subsequently cultured in potassium simplex optimization medium supplemented with a solution of 1% Eagle's Basal Medium and Minimum Essential Media non-essential amino acids, 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, UK), 95 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 0.35 mM KH2PO4, 1.71 mM CaCl2, 25 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM bovine serum albumin, 1 mM glutamine, 0.2 mM pyruvate, 10 mM sodium DL-lactate, 0.2 mM D-glucose, 0.2 mM MgSO4 and 0.01 mM EDTA, and were overlaid with embryo-tested mineral oil in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37C. Unless otherwise specified, all reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). A total of 20 h post-hCG administration, when the pronucleus was observable, the zygotes were randomly divided into two groups (50 zygotes/group). One group was cultured at 37C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 under normal gravity for 9 h (three repetitions, groups C1, C2 and C3), after which, the zygotes (in which the pronuclei were adjacent to each other) were collected immediately. The other group was cultured at 37C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in the RCCS (Synthecon Inc., Houston, TX, USA), under simulated microgravity for 9 h, as described previously (three repetitions, groups R1, R2 and R3).     The zygotes exhibiting disrupted pronuclear migration were collected immediately.     Zygotes collected from the two groups were transferred to 80 ul RNA extraction buffer (Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit; Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) for RNA isolation and were stored at -80C until sequencing.     To prepare single-cell cDNA, all the samples were amplified using the Smart-Seq2 method, and a cDNA product of 1-2 kb in length was obtained. Subsequently, single-cell cDNA was purified with the Ampure XP kit (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA). The concentration and fragment distribution of the single-cell cDNA obtained from normal gravity and simulated microgravity zygote samples were subsequently assessed in a Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), and the High Sensitivity DNA Assay kit in the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA).  Single-cell cDNA (20 ng) was used as the initial material for library construction. Initially, a Bioruptor Sonication system (20-60 kHz; 4C; 30 sec; Diagenode, Inc., Denville, NJ, USA) was employed to generate small fragments of approximately 300 bp in length. Subsequently, the library fragments were subjected to end repair via the addition of a poly(A) tail and an adapter sequence. The Beckman Ampure XP kit was used to purify fragments after each reaction. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was subsequently performed, and different index tags, which were used for distinguishing samples from each other during sequencing, were added to each sample. The PCR products were retrieved via 2% agarose gel electrophoresis in order to select for 4,000-bp DNA fragments, from which the library was constructed. The Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) was then used to assess the quality of the libraries.     The libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) using 100bp single-end sequencing.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.3 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.3/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none (unstranded) and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported into R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Animals from the same mouse cohort were distributed into groups based on body weight to determine the effects of different processing protocols (Immediate, Whole Carcass, and Partial Carcass) and freezing methods (Glovebox freezer, Cryochiller, dry ice, and liquid nitrogen) on gene expression profiles.  The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and was approved on July 17, 2019, by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at NASA Ames Research Center (Protocol number NAS-19-003-Y1).  Animals were euthanized with IP injection of Ketamine (up to 150mg/kg)/Xylazine (up to 45mg/kg) followed by cervical dislocation.     Immediate (I) samples: To mimic on-orbit procedures, 3 sets of 2 animals were processed consecutively each day for 2 consecutive days. Upon euthanasia, carcasses were weighed, and tissues were harvested beginning 5 minutes after euthanasia (to mimic the usual time needed for on-orbit blood draw) in the following order: abdominal fat, spleen, liver, kidney, uterus, hindlimb, eyeball, and brain. Dissection times were recorded, and all tissues were weighed before placement into 1.8mL or 4mL cryotubes then inserted into the corresponding Glovebox freezer (GF) slot. Since the GF may become slightly warmer during a full day of operations, each set of n=2 animals processed was labeled as the first, second, or third set of animals processed in the given day of operations. An additional control set of n=5 animals were processed in the same manner as described but the tissues in the 1.8mL or 4mL cryotubes were frozen by submersion in liquid nitrogen (LN2) assess how the Rapid Freeze hardware compares with laboratory gold standard practices. Once frozen, tissues were stored at -80C.  Whole Carcass (WCar) samples: To assess whole carcass freezing rates using the Cryochiller (CryoC) during a normal day of on-orbit operations, 3 sets of 2 animals were processed consecutively each day for 2 consecutive days. Upon euthanasia, carcasses were weighed and, following a 10-minute wait period, a Type T thermocouple was inserted into the abdomen via gavage then the carcasses were double foil-wrapped using 6inch x 7inch x 0.001inch foil sheets. The average size go-gauge was utilized to perform a fit check before inserting the carcasses into 2 opposing Cryochiller slots 20min after euthanasia. For every insertion, the lid was removed and replaced once to mimic on-orbit operations. After the unit reached its full capacity (4 carcasses), the first insertion set (n=2) was removed and replaced with a new set (n=2) of samples. On day 2 of operations, after the 3rd set of 2 carcasses were frozen, a stress test was performed on the Cryochiller hardware in which a 4th set of 4 animals were processed at the same time to assess whole carcass freezing profiles using the Cryochiller at max capacity after a full day of operations. Two control sets of animals were processed in the same manner as described but the carcasses were frozen by submersion in liquid nitrogen (n=6) or on dry ice (DI) (n=7) to assess how the Rapid Freeze hardware compares with laboratory gold standard practices and our current standard methods, respectively. Once frozen, tissues were stored at -80C.  Partial Carcass (PCar) samples: During Rodent Research missions, carcasses are usually partially dissected prior to freezing. Thus, to assess the partial carcass freezing rate using the Cryochiller, animals were processed as described for Whole Carcass samples except that after the 10-minute wait period, both hindlimbs were removed and the remaining partial carcass was weighed prior to thermocouple insertion and foil wrapping.  For Whole (WCar) and Partial (PCar) carcass samples, frozen carcasses were thawed for ~30 minutes at room temperature then the liver, spleen, and soleus (whole carcass only) were dissected and preserved. Liver was preserved in LN2 and stored in -80C freezer until further processing.      RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use.  Approximately 20~25 mg of tissue was thawed on ice, isolated using a scalpel, weighed and immediately placed in 700 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix (Zirconium 2.0mm RINO Lysis, Next Advance)  on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 5 minutes at 4C.  Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer protocol.  RNA was eluted in 50 uL RNAse free H2O, and DNA was eluted in 50 uL EB buffer. Concentration for all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR kit.  RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA Cat # 4456739, v92) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added immediately after RNA extractions at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol.     RNA ribo depletion was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold. Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN > 4. Index adapters were 1.5 uM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size ~300 bp was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured by Universal qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control was determined by iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Paired end 149bp. PhiX included as control.     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.4). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.9) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.5c) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 101, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.101.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.5c) and aligned reads from 3 samples were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.0.3) with tximport (version 1.18.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.30.0). The data was normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.30.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.2.0), PANTHER.db (v1.0.10), and org.Mm.eg.db (v3.12.0).",

          "Study Description": "Data from the NASA Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) mission showed that gene-expression levels in mouse livers are different depending on what tissue preservation protocol is used and that slow freezing is not an effective method for preserving signals in gene-expression data. In response to these and other observations, the Rapid Freeze hardware was built for use on the International Space Station. The Rapid Freeze hardware freezes mouse tissues (Glovebox freezer) and whole carcasses (Cryochiller) at rates closely mimicking those attained with immersion in liquid nitrogen. Because this hardware will be used extensively on future rodent research missions, it is crucial to understand whether or not it preserves signals in gene expression data in order to maximize the value of these rare and expensive spaceflight experiments. Therefore, this study was designed with three goals: 1) To evaluate the temperature profile of the Cryochiller and Glovebox freezer cartridges (Rapid Freeze hardware) over time during mock on-orbit procedures; 2) To determine the freezing profiles of tissues and carcasses using Rapid Freeze hardware at both optimal and sub-optimal temperatures (to mimic on-orbit operations), compared with those frozen in liquid nitrogen (the laboratory gold standard) or frozen at -80 C (the current standard method); 3) To identify gene expression changes in a) tissues that were frozen via the Glovebox freezer and b) tissues dissected from whole or partial carcasses that were frozen via the Cryochiller versus tissues that were frozen via control methods (liquid nitrogen or -80C slow freeze) to assess how the Rapid Freeze hardware compares with laboratory gold standard practices and our current standard methods.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Animals from the same mouse cohort were distributed into groups based on body weight to determine the effects of different processing protocols (Immediate, Whole Carcass, and Partial Carcass) and freezing methods (Glovebox freezer, Cryochiller, dry ice, and liquid nitrogen) on gene expression profiles.\n\nThe study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and was approved on July 17, 2019, by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at NASA Ames Research Center (Protocol number NAS-19-003-Y1).\n\nAnimals were euthanized with IP injection of Ketamine (up to 150mg/kg)/Xylazine (up to 45mg/kg) followed by cervical dislocation.     Immediate (I) samples: To mimic on-orbit procedures, 3 sets of 2 animals were processed consecutively each day for 2 consecutive days. Upon euthanasia, carcasses were weighed, and tissues were harvested beginning 5 minutes after euthanasia (to mimic the usual time needed for on-orbit blood draw) in the following order: abdominal fat, spleen, liver, kidney, uterus, hindlimb, eyeball, and brain. Dissection times were recorded, and all tissues were weighed before placement into 1.8mL or 4mL cryotubes then inserted into the corresponding Glovebox freezer (GF) slot. Since the GF may become slightly warmer during a full day of operations, each set of n=2 animals processed was labeled as the first, second, or third set of animals processed in the given day of operations. An additional control set of n=5 animals were processed in the same manner as described but the tissues in the 1.8mL or 4mL cryotubes were frozen by submersion in liquid nitrogen (LN2) assess how the Rapid Freeze hardware compares with laboratory gold standard practices. Once frozen, tissues were stored at -80C.\n\nWhole Carcass (WCar) samples: To assess whole carcass freezing rates using the Cryochiller (CryoC) during a normal day of on-orbit operations, 3 sets of 2 animals were processed consecutively each day for 2 consecutive days. Upon euthanasia, carcasses were weighed and, following a 10-minute wait period, a Type T thermocouple was inserted into the abdomen via gavage then the carcasses were double foil-wrapped using 6inch x 7inch x 0.001inch foil sheets. The average size go-gauge was utilized to perform a fit check before inserting the carcasses into 2 opposing Cryochiller slots 20min after euthanasia. For every insertion, the lid was removed and replaced once to mimic on-orbit operations. After the unit reached its full capacity (4 carcasses), the first insertion set (n=2) was removed and replaced with a new set (n=2) of samples. On day 2 of operations, after the 3rd set of 2 carcasses were frozen, a stress test was performed on the Cryochiller hardware in which a 4th set of 4 animals were processed at the same time to assess whole carcass freezing profiles using the Cryochiller at max capacity after a full day of operations. Two control sets of animals were processed in the same manner as described but the carcasses were frozen by submersion in liquid nitrogen (n=6) or on dry ice (DI) (n=7) to assess how the Rapid Freeze hardware compares with laboratory gold standard practices and our current standard methods, respectively. Once frozen, tissues were stored at -80C.\n\nPartial Carcass (PCar) samples: During Rodent Research missions, carcasses are usually partially dissected prior to freezing. Thus, to assess the partial carcass freezing rate using the Cryochiller, animals were processed as described for Whole Carcass samples except that after the 10-minute wait period, both hindlimbs were removed and the remaining partial carcass was weighed prior to thermocouple insertion and foil wrapping.\n\nFor Whole and Partial Carcass samples, frozen carcasses were thawed for ~30 minutes at room temperature then the liver, spleen, and soleus (whole carcass only) were dissected and preserved. Spleens were removed from carcasses 6-7min after the dissection start time and stored in RNAlater at 4C for 24hr then frozen and stored at -80C. Frozen spleens from Immediate, Whole Carcass, and Partial Carcass samples were cut in half and one half was homogenized in AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit's homogenization RLT buffer for immediate extraction.     RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use.  Approximately 20 mg of tissue was thawed on ice, isolated using a scalpel, weighed and immediately placed in 700 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix (Zirconium 2.0mm RINO Lysis, Next Advance)  on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 5 minutes at 4C.  Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer protocol.  RNA was eluted in 50 uL RNAse free H2O, and DNA was eluted in 50 uL EB buffer. Concentration for all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR kit.  RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA Cat # 4456739, v92) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added immediately after RNA extractions at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol.     RNA ribo depletion was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold. Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN > 4. Index adapters were 1.5 uM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size ~300 bp was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured by Universal qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control was determined by iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Paired end 149bp. PhiX included as control.     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.4). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.9) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.5c) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 101, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.101.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.5c) and aligned reads from 3 samples were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.0.3) with tximport (version 1.18.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.30.0). The data was normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.30.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.2.0), PANTHER.db (v1.0.10), and org.Mm.eg.db (v3.12.0).",

          "Study Description": "Data from the NASA Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) mission showed that gene-expression levels in mouse livers are different depending on what tissue preservation protocol is used and that slow freezing is not an effective method for preserving signals in gene-expression data. In response to these and other observations, the Rapid Freeze hardware was built for use on the International Space Station. The Rapid Freeze hardware freezes mouse tissues (Glovebox freezer) and whole carcasses (Cryochiller) at rates closely mimicking those attained with immersion in liquid nitrogen. Because this hardware will be used extensively on future rodent research missions, it is crucial to understand whether or not it preserves signals in gene expression data in order to maximize the value of these rare and expensive spaceflight experiments. Therefore, this study was designed with three goals: 1) To evaluate the temperature profile of the Cryochiller and Glovebox freezer cartridges (Rapid Freeze hardware) over time during mock on-orbit procedures; 2) To determine the freezing profiles of tissues and carcasses using Rapid Freeze hardware at both optimal and sub-optimal temperatures (to mimic on-orbit operations), compared with those frozen in liquid nitrogen (the laboratory gold standard) or frozen in at -80 C (the current standard method); 3) To identify gene expression changes in a) tissues that were frozen via the Glovebox freezer and b) tissues dissected from whole or partial carcasses that were frozen via the Cryochiller versus tissues that were frozen via control methods (liquid nitrogen or -80C slow freeze) to assess how the Rapid Freeze hardware compares with laboratory gold standard practices and our current standard methods.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "The serial sacrifice study included 15 male mice with 3 mice per time point at five time-points (30, 60, 120, 270, and 360 days) post-exposure to HZE, specifically 56Fe irradiation. Additionally, 15 mice were used as controls, at the same time points, resulting in a total of 30 mice for this study.The mice were shipped from the vendor to Brookhaven National Laboratories (BNL) and housed at the BNL animal facility until the time of irradiation at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL). Following irradiation, the animals were shipped to the UTMB Animal Resources Center (ARC), quarantined for 1 month, and maintained in the ARC for the duration of the experiment. Animals were housed in sterile cages with free access to food and water. Facilities at both BNL and UTMB are fully AAALAC accredited, ensuring adequacy of animal care at both animal facilities.     At each of the five time-points, 3 animals from each group were randomly selected and euthanized using CO2 asphyxiation, as per current AVMA guidelines for euthanasia. Prior to euthanasia, animals were weighed and weights recorded. Post euthanasia, tissues of the left lobe of livers were collected, snap-frozen on either dry ice or liquid nitrogen, and stored at − 80 °C until tissues could be extracted for RNA analysis. Livers were sampled by taking two 40-μm thick slices using a cryotome at − 20 °C.     Total RNA was isolated from the liver slices using RNAqueousTM Total RNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) rRNA was removed via Ribo-ZeroTM rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) prior to library preparation.     Library was prepared with Illumina TruSeq RNA Library kit     Samples were sequenced in a paired-end 50 base format on an Illumina HiSeq 1500.

Bioinformatics (Oxford, England) 2013;29(1):15-21 doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bts635published Online First: Epub Date.) -quantMode GeneCounts option was used to obtain read counts per gene based on the Gencode release M14 annotation file Genome_build: Genome Reference Consortium Mouse Build 38 Supplementary_files_format_and_content: comma-seperated text file which includes raw transcript expression counts (with corresponding ENSEMBL ID) for each sample.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.3 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.3/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none (unstranded) and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported into R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value.

          "Study Description": "Background: mRNA interactions with each other and other signaling molecules define different biological pathways and functions. Researchers have been investigating various tools to analyze these types of interactions. In particular, gene co-expression network methods have proved useful in finding and analyzing these molecular interactions. Many different analytical pipelines to identify these interactions networks have been proposed with the aim of identifying an optimal partition of the network where the individual modules are neither too small to make any general inference or too large to be biologically interpretable. Results: In this study, we propose a new pipeline to perform gene co-expression network analysis. The proposed pipeline uses WGCNA, a widely used software to perform different aspects of gene co-expression network analysis and modularity maximization algorithm to analyze novel RNA-Seq data to understand the effects of low-dose 56Fe ion irradiation on the formation of hepatocellular carcinoma in mice. The network results along with experimental validation show that using WGCNA combined with Modularity provide a more biologically interpretable network in our dataset. Our pipeline showed better performance than the existing clustering algorithm in WGCNA in finding modules and identified a module with mitochondrial subunits that are supported by mitochondrial complex assay. Conclusions: We present a pipeline that can reduce the problem of parameter selection with the existing algorithm in WGCNA for comparable RNA-Seq datasets which may assist in future research to discover novel mRNA interactions and their downstream molecular effects. C57BL16 males were placed into 2 treatment groups and received the following irradiation treatments at Brookhaven National Laboratories (Long Island, NY): 600 MeV/n 56Fe (0.2 Gy), and no irradiation. Left liver lobes were collected at 30, 60, 120, 270, and 360 days post-irradiation, flash frozen and stored at -80°C until they could be processed for RNA-Seq. Livers were sampled by taking two 40-micron thick slices using a cryotome at -20°C. This allowed multiple sampling of the tissue without the tissue going through multiple freeze/thaw cycles. Total RNA was isolated from the liver slices using RNAqueousTM Total RNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and rRNA was removed via Ribo-ZeroTM rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) prior to library preparation with the Illumina TruSeq RNA Library kit. Samples were sequenced in a paired-end 50 base format on an Illumina HiSeq 1500. Reads were aligned to the mouse GRCm38 reference genome using the STAR alignment program, version 2.5.3a, with the recommended ENCODE options. The -quantMode GeneCounts option was used to obtain read counts per gene based on the Gencode release M14 annotation file. Total number of reads used in analysis varies between 23-35 millions of reads.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "BALB/c mice that served as hosts were purchased from Taconic Laboratory. The inguinal mammary glands of 3-week-old mice were cleared bilaterally of endogenous epithelium. At 10 to 12 weeks old, the mice were irradiated with 100 cGy gamma-rays or sham-irradiated at NYUSOM. The cleared mammary fat pads of host mice were transplanted with Trp53-null mammary gland fragments from nonirradiated donor mice 3 days later. Sham or irradiated mice were then randomly assigned to receive ad libitum, either control diet (7012 meal) containing CAPE or control of 1% sucrose (Harlan Laboratories, Teklad lab animal diets). CAPE was added in sucrose at 10 g/kg as 10 nmol diet (CAPE at 0.47 mg/kg), 500 nmol (CAPE at 23.5 mg/kg), and 1,000 nmol diet (CAPE at 47 mg/kg). The CAPE concentration in the food and average food intake was used to estimate the dose. New 25-kg batches of diet were made every 3 months across the experiment. Blue or red food dyes at 0.2 g/kg diet were used to color code diets and prevent accidental feeding with the wrong diet. To preclude potential toxicity, dosing was escalated beginning with 10 nmol/mouse/day from 4 weeks after transplant until 14 weeks, increased to 500 nmol at 26 weeks and ending at 1,000 nmol begun at 38 weeks, which was maintained for the remaining duration of the experiment. No toxicity (e.g., weight loss, poor grooming) was evident at any dose.     For radiation quality experiments, mice aged to 10 months at NYUSOM were transported to Brookhaven National Laboratory (Upton, NY), which conducted institutional review and approval. Mice were acclimated for at least 1 week, and whole-body irradiation was performed at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory in Brookhaven National Laboratory using a 5600 Curie (207 TBq) 137Cs source to deliver SIR. Hosts were irradiated with 100 cGy gamma-rays or sham-irradiated at NYUSOM. Cesium-137 produces gamma rays with an energy of 0.662 MeV and has a half-life of 30.1 years. Ionizing radiation energy values were added by GeneLab.     For all experiments, mice were palpated twice weekly from 6 months posttransplantation. Palpable tumors were measured twice a week using calipers. Tumors reaching 1 cm^3 were resected using survival surgery. The resected tumor was divided into four portions. One portion was frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction, one portion was embedded in optimum cutting temperature compound, one portion was formalin-fixed followed by paraffin embedding, and one portion was cut into fragments for viable preservation in DMEM (Gibco,  10564-011) with 10% FBS (Hyclone,  SH3007103) and 10% DMSO (Sigma,  D2650). Mice were further observed, and if the contralateral fat pad developed another tumor, then the tumor was monitored. If the resected tumor recurred, it was resected, and the mouse was euthanized. A gross necroscopy was performed upon termination. If no tumor developed from transplanted glands by the end of the experiment, mammary glands were collected, and the tissue stained by carmin alum (2 g carmin from Sigma  1022; 2.5 aluminum potassium sulfate from Sigma  A-7167; and 0.05g thymol crystals from Sigma  T-0501 in 500 mL distilled water). The stained wholemounts were evaluated to ascertain successful transplantation. An informative transplant was defined as that which had an epithelial outgrowth evident by tumor development or greater than 25% fat pad with gland development. Transplanted mammary glands that failed to develop epithelial outgrowths were censored.     Frozen tumor tissues (50 mg) were lysed in 1 mL TRIzol reagent and homogenized with Omni Tissue Homogenizer on medium setting for 30 seconds, then incubated 3 minutes in 0.2 mL chloroform, followed by centrifuging for 15 minutes at 12,000 x g at 4°C. The aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube and 0.5 mL isopropanol was added for 10 minutes. Samples were then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 12,000 x g at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, and the white gel-like pellets were resuspended in 1 mL of 75 % ethanol. The samples were then vortexed briefly, then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 7500 x g at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, and the RNA pellet air-dried for 5–10 minutes before resuspending in 30 uL of RNase-free water. The samples were incubated in a heat-block at 60°C for 15 minutes before determining total RNA quality (RIN greater than 7.0), and quantity was determined using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and Nanodrop ND-100.     Express RNA sequencing was performed from tumors derived from CAPE and control treated irradiated hosts using TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Guide Protocol by Illumina (15008136 A).     Illumina HiSeq 2500     Read mapping was performed using Tophat 2.0.9 against the mm10 human reference genome. The resulting BAM alignment files were processed using the HTSeq 0.6.1 python framework and respective mm10 GTF gene annotation, obtained from the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) database. Subsequently, the Bioconductor package DESeq2 (3.2) was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). This package provides statistics for determination of DEGs using a model based on the negative binomial distribution. Statistically significant genes were determined using the Benjamini–Hochberg’s method for controlling false discovery rate (FDR). Genes with an adjusted p value less than 0.05 were determined to be differentially expressed.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.12.1 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.26. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of Mus-musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 09-May-2025.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.2 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.2/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to none and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Total RNA was extracted using Trizol Reaget (Invitrogen), according to manufacturer's instructions.     100 ng of total RNA were used to prepare cRNA following the Affymetrix 3’IVT Express Kit labeling protocol. cRNA converted from total RNA by reverse transcription and in vitro transcription of the intermediate cDNA product.     12.5 micrograms of fragmented cRNA was hybridized for 16 hr to the Affymetrix MG 430 2.0 arrays using GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 and Genechip® fluidics station FS 450, following standard Affymetrix protocols.     Affymetrix GeneChip scanner 7G     Feature intensity was extracted by Affymetrix GeneChip Operating System as CEL files. The probe-level analysis of the CEL files was performed by the RMA algorithm using Agilent GeneSpring GX10 program. No further adjustments were made to the data in the table.     All animal experiments were performed at New York University School of Medicine (NYUSOM, New York, NY). The protocols for animal husbandry and experiments were conducted with institutional review and approval. Three-week-old BALB/c mice that served as hosts were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. Syngeneic Trp53−/− BALB/c mice were bred as described previously to 8 to 10 weeks of age to provide donor mammary gland that was cryogenically preserved in 10% DMSO. All mice were housed 5 per cage, fed with Labdiet  5001 Rodent Formula (Purina Animal Nutrition LLC), and water ad libitum. The radiation-genetic chimera model was described previously in which the endogenous mammary epithelium of inguinal glands were surgically removed from 3-week-old wild-type BALB/c mice, the mice were aged prior to irradiation, and the inguinal fatpads subsequently transplanted with the Trp53−/− donor mammary fragments.     For radiation quality experiments, mice aged to 10 months at NYUSOM were transported to Brookhaven National Laboratory (Upton, NY), which conducted institutional review and approval. Mice were acclimated for at least 1 week, and whole-body irradiation was performed at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory in Brookhaven National Laboratory using a 5600 Curie (207 TBq) 137Cs source to deliver SIR to total body doses of 10, 50, or 100 cGy. Alternatively, mice were irradiated with DIR using 600 MeV/amu Fe, 350 MeV/amu Ar, and 350 MeV/amu Si ions at equivalent fluences (3 particles per 102 mm) in which total body average doses were calculated to be 80 cGy for Fe, 49 cGy for Ar, and 30 cGy for Si. Contemporaneous controls were transported, anesthetized, and sham-irradiated. Three days after irradiation, the cleared mammary fat pads of host mice were transplanted with Trp53-null mammary gland fragments from nonirradiated donor mice. The approximately 1 mm3 fragment was rapidly thawed from cryogenically preserved fragments of 8- to 10-week-old Trp53−/− mice inguinal glands. Mice were transported to NYUSOM and quarantined for 6 weeks upon return. Mice were monitored by palpation at weekly intervals before 6 months and twice weekly thereafter for 600 days posttransplantation.  Mice received whole body irradiation with 10, 50, or 100 cGy sparsely ionizing γ-rays or 49 cGy for Ar or 30 cGy for Si densely ionizing rays. Cesium-137 produces gamma rays with an energy of 0.662 MeV and has a half-life of 30.1 years. Ionizing radiation energy values were added by GeneLab.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with applicable federal and state guidelines and were approved by the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) under protocol number AC-AAAB8465. Approximately two-month-old male C57BL/6N mice (stock number 027) were obtained from Charles River Labs (Frederick, MD) and acclimatized for at least a week before whole body irradiation. At 8 - 10 weeks of age, mice were exposed in the early afternoon to radiation doses of 0, 1.5, 3, 6, or 10 Gy using an AECL Gammacell-40 137Cs gamma-ray source (Ottowa, CA) at a dose rate 1.05 Gy/ min. During exposure, animals were individually housed within a RadDisk Rodent Microisolation Irradiator Disk (Braintree Scientific, Braintree, MA), which facilitates simultaneous uniform exposure of up to eight mice.     For each dose, 10 mice were humanely euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation at 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days after irradiation. Approximately 0.8–1.0 ml blood was obtained immediately from each animal via cardiac puncture and added to 1.5ml PAXgene Blood RNA stabilization and lysis solution (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) in a 15ml conical centrifuge tube and gently inverted several times. Additional blood RNA stabilization/lysis solution was added to achieve a 1:5 final ratio of blood:PAXgene solution and the samples were kept at room temperature for two hours prior to overnight refrigeration.     Mice were euthanized at 1, 2, 3, 5 or 7 days after irradiation. Blood was obtained via cardiac puncture and immediately added to a tube containing PAXgene Blood RNA stabilization and lysis solution at a ratio of 1:5 (blood:solution) and mixed. RNA was purified following the PAXgene RNA kit recommendations with on-column DNase I treatment, followed by globin reduction using GLOBINclear-Mouse/Rat.     Cyanine-3 (Cy3) labeled cRNA was prepared from 0.2 ug RNA using the One-Color Low RNA Input Linear Amplification PLUS kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by RNAeasy column purification (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). Dye incorporation and cRNA yield were checked with the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer.     1.5 ug of Cy3-labelled cRNA (specific activity greater than 10.0 pmol Cy3/ug cRNA) was fragmented at 60 C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 250 µl containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturers instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 250 ml of 2x Agilent hybridization buffer was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to Agilent Whole Mouse Genome Oligo Microarrays 4X44K v2 (G4846A) for 17 hours at 65 C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37 C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately by brief centrifugation.     Slides were scanned immediately after washing on the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2505B) using one color scan setting for 4x44k v.2 array slides (Scan Area 61x21.6 mm, Scan resolution 10um, Dye channel is set to Green and Green PMT is set to 100%).     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7112 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Agilent_1-channel/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7112_Versions/GL-DPPD-7112.md), using NF_MAAgilent1ch version 1.0.3 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAgilent1ch_1.0.3/Microarray/Agilent_1-channel/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAgilent1ch). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.1). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3). Raw data quality assurance density, pseudo image, MA, and foreground-background plots were generated using limma (version 3.50.3), and boxplots were generated using ggplot2 (version 3.4.0). The raw intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the limma (version 3.50.3) quantile method. Normalized data quality assurance density, pseudo image, and MA plots were generated using limma (version 3.50.3), and boxplots were generated using ggplot2 (version 3.4.0). Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probe using the Ensembl database ftp server (ensembl.org, release 107). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probe to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Description": "Due to limitations of available human models for development of gene expression based radiation biodosimetry, many such studies have made use of mouse models. To provide a broad view of the gene expression response to irradiation in the mouse, we have exposed male C57BL/6 mice to 0, 1.5, 3, 6 or 10 Gy of gamma rays, sacrificing groups of the mice at 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7 days after exposure. We then profiled global gene expression in blood from individual mice using Agilent microarrays. In general, we found increasing numbers of genes differentially expressed with increasing dose, with more prolonged responses after the higher doses. Gene ontology analysis showed a similar pattern, with more biological processes enriched among the genes responding to higher doses, and at later times after exposure. Clustering the timecourse expression data using maSigPro identified four broad patterns of response, representing different gene ontology functions. The largest of these clusters included genes with initially decreased expression followed by increased expression at later times, a pattern of expression previously reported for several genes following neutron exposure. Another gene cluster showing consistent down regulation suggests genes useful for biodosimetry throughout the first week after exposure can be identified.",

Approximately 20 mg of tissue was isolated using a scalpel on dry ice without thawing, weighed and immediately placed in 1000 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 20,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at RT and at 14,000 X g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 uL RNase/DNase free water, and DNA was eluted in 50 uL EB buffer. Concentration for all RNA and DNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA Cat # 4456739, v92) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added immediately after RNA extractions at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol.     RNA ribo depletion was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold. Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN > 4.  Index adapters were 1.5 uM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size ~300 bp was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured by Universal qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control was determined by iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Paired end 98bp. PhiX included as control at 1%.     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports.

Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads from 3 samples were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.0.3) with tximport (version 1.18.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.30.0). The data was normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.30.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value.

          "Study Protocol Description": "Mouse cohort was divided into 6 groups with 6 mice per group.  Three test types of euthanasia were administered separately, assuming 30 mg mouse weight: Euthasol by i.p. at 1666 mg/ kg, cocktail of 100 mg/ kg Ketamine and 30 mg/ kg Xylazine by i.p. or CO2 inhalation.  Euthanasia was followed by cervial dislocation.  Mice in group 1 (M1-M6), group 2 (M7-M12), group 3 (M13-M18) and group 4 (M19-M24)  were administered with Euthasol.  Mice in group 5 (M25-M30) were given Ketamine and Xylazine.  Mice in group 6 (M31-M36) were administered with CO2 inhalation.     Mouse carcasses from group 1 were not preserved, instead those were dissected immediately upon euthanasia.  Carcasses were preserved for the following:  group 2 in dry ice, group 3 in LN2, group 4 in RNAlater, group 5 in dry ice and group 6 in dry ice or LN2.    For groups 2 to 6, mouse carcasses were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes for dissection. Each carcass dissection time was no longer than 1 hour from collection of the first tissue. Multiple tissues, including the quadriceps tissue, were collected from each carcass. Quadriceps from each mouse in group 1 were subdivided and preserved in LN2, RNAlater or dry ice. All quadriceps were stored separately in -80 C freezer for sample processing. Quadriceps tissues, groups 2-6, were processed immediately after collection or snap frozen in LN2, except for group 4, those quadriceps were preserved in RNAlater. Processed quadriceps were submerged in AllPrep DNA/ RNA Mini Kit's homogenization RLT buffer for immediate extraction.       AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA):  Homogenization buffer for DNA and RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. After thawing on ice, approximately 30 mg of tissue was isolated using a scalpel, weighed and immediately placed in 600 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 20,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at RT and at 14,000 X g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 uL H2O, and DNA was eluted in 50 uL EB buffer. Concentration for all RNA and DNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA Cat # 4456739, v92) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added immediately after RNA extractions at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol.      Sequencing library construction was performed by GeneLab's Sample Processing Lab. RNA ribo depletion done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold. Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN > 4.  Index adapters were 1.5 uM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters).  15 cycles PCR were performed.  Library fragment size ~300 bp was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).  Pooled library concentration was measured by Universal qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA).  Library quality control was determined by iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).       RNA sequencing performed on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Paired end 149bp. PhiX included as control.       Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 96, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads from 3 samples were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.0.3) with tximport (version 1.18.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.30.0). The data was normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.30.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.2.0), PANTHER.db (v1.0.10), and org.Mm.eg.db (v3.12.0). ",

However, sample preservation protocols must also be compatible with available equipment and crew time. NASA's Rodent Research (RR) missions have used various methods for euthanasia, carcass preservation, and tissue preservation. This study extends the sample preservation study performed by GeneLab in GLDS-49 which examined conditions used for the RR-1 mission to include conditions used for multiple RR missions and is designed to help determine factors which may confound data analysis. To determine whether these various factors affect changes in gene expression, this ground-based study generated gene expression profiles measured by RNAseq from the quadriceps of 20-21 week-old female C57BL/6J mice. Multiple, interacting factors were investigated: 1) To understand how euthanasia protocols affect gene expression when mouse carcasses are slow frozen, mice were euthanized by either euthasol injection, ketamine/xylazine injection, or CO2 inhalation, and carcasses slow frozen on dry-ice mimicking carcass preservation in the MELFI on the ISS. Carcasses were thawed and RNA extracted from quadriceps; 2) To understand how carcass preservation protocols affect gene expression, mice were euthanized with euthasol and carcasses preserved by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen, slow freezing on dry ice, or immersion in RNAlater following three-way segmentation. Carcasses were thawed and RNA extracted from quadriceps; 3) To understand how tissue preservation protocols affect gene expression, mice were euthanized with euthasol and quadriceps immediately dissected and preserved by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen, slow freezing on dry ice, or immersion in RNAlater.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Mouse cohort was divided into 6 groups with 6 mice per group.  Three test types of euthanasia were administered separately, assuming 30 mg mouse weight: Euthasol by i.p. at 1666 mg/ kg, cocktail of 100 mg/ kg Ketamine and 30 mg/ kg Xylazine by i.p. or CO2 inhalation.  Euthanasia was followed by cervial dislocation.  Mice in group 1 (M1-M6), group 2 (M7-M12), group 3 (M13-M18) and group 4 (M19-M24)  were administered with Euthasol.  Mice in group 5 (M25-M30) were administered with Ketamine and Xylazine.  Mice in group 6 (M31-M36) were administered with CO2 inhalation.     Mouse carcasses from group 1 were not preserved, instead those were dissected immediately upon euthanasia.  Carcasses were preserved for the following: group 2 in dry ice, group 3 in LN2, group 4 in RNAlater, group 5 in dry ice and group 6 in dry ice or LN2.  For groups 2 to 6, mouse carcasses were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes for dissection. Each carcass dissection time was no longer than 1 hour from collection of the first tissue. Multiple tissues, including the liver tissue, were collected from each carcass. Liver lobes from each mouse in group 1 were subdivided and preserved in LN2, RNAlater or dry ice. All liver were stored separately in -80 C freezer for sample processing. Liver tissues, groups 2-6, were processed immediately after collection or snap frozen in LN2, except for group 4, those liver were preserved in RNAlater. Processed liver were submerged in AllPrep DNA/ RNA Mini Kit's homogenization RLT buffer for immediate extraction. Addition of RLT buffer for immediate extraction and 70 day extraction were performed on group 2.     AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA):  Homogenization buffer for DNA and RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. After thawing on ice, approximately 30 mg of tissue was isolated using a scalpel, weighed and immediately placed in 600 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 20,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at RT and at 14,000 X g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 uL H2O, and DNA was eluted in 50 uL EB buffer.

          "Study Protocol Description": "Ten-week-old female, C57BL/6J mice were unloaded using antiorthostatic tail suspension. Ten animals were included in each treatment group. Unsuspended controls were housed in identical cages with tail restraint, but no unloading. Animals were subjected to AOS for two weeks and then immunized with intraperitoneal injection of saline, 5 LF/mL tetanus toxoid (TT) with a 0.1 mL injection volume, 0.4 mg/mL CpG ODN 1826 in 0.1(CpG) with a 0.1 mL injection volume, or both TT and CpG with a 0.2mL injection volume.       Two weeks post immunization, a standardized collection assembly-line was used to euthanize the animals and collect the tissue to minimize experimental variation. Animals from each of eight treatment groups were randomly sacrificed using 100% CO2 followed by cervical dislocation on four different collection dates; two consecutive collection days per experiment, 20 mice per day. Blood, spleen and bone marrow were collected first as primary science for this experiment with other tissues collected thereafter. Bone marrow was flushed from the bones in a solution containing PBS and RNAlater. Cells were resuspended to make single cell suspensions, were centrifuged at 300 x g and pelleted cells were snap frozen in liquid N2. Samples were stored in -80C prior to analysis.      Bone marrow was processed with Trizol according to the manufacturer's instructions.     One microgram of high-quality total RNA was used for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) library construction using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with the following modification: one minute fragmentation time was applied to allow for longer RNA fragments. The obtained RNA-seq libraries were analyzed with the 2100 Bioanalyzer. The tissue sample described previously was then subjected to size selection and designated/     Total RNA was sequenced on the Illumia MiSeq 2x300 nucleotide platform at the Kansas State University Integrated Genomics Facility. Twenty-four bone marrow samples were sequenced, for a total of three animals per treatment group. Samples were selected for sequencing based on highest RIN scores.     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 96, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value.

          "Study Protocol Description": "10-week-old mice were tail-suspended for 28 days, and the sham group mice were fed under the same feeding conditions in the same space.     RNA was extracted by mirVanaTM RNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystem p/n AM1556 ) following the manufacturer's instructions.     Cyanine-3 (Cy3) labeled cRNA was prepared from 0.2 μg RNA using the One-Color Low RNA Input Linear Amplification PLUS kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by RNAeasy column purification (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). Dye incorporation and cRNA yield were checked with the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer.     0.6 μg of Cy3-labelled cRNA (specific activity greater than 10.0 pmol Cy3/μg cRNA) was fragmented at 60°C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 22.5μl containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturers' instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 22.5μl of 2x Agilent hybridization buffer was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to Agilent SurePrint G3 Mouse GE(8*60K) for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately by brief centrifugation.     Slides were scanned immediately after washing on the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2505C) using one color scan setting for 4x180k array slides (Scan Area 61x21.6 mm, Scan resolution 3um, Dye channel is set to Green and Green PMT is set to 100%).     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7112 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Agilent_1-channel/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7112_Versions/GL-DPPD-7112.md), using NF_MAAgilent1ch version 1.0.1 (GitHub link coming soon). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.1). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3). Raw data quality assurance density, pseudo image, MA, and foreground-background plots were generated using limma (version 3.50.3), and boxplots were generated using ggplot2 (version 3.4.0). The raw intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the limma (version 3.50.3) quantile method. Normalized data quality assurance density, pseudo image, and MA plots were generated using limma (version 3.50.3), and boxplots were generated using using ggplot2 (version 3.4.0). Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probe using biomaRt (version 2.50.0), Ensembl database (ensembl.org, release 107). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probe to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned for every probe that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Low-dose/Low-dose-rate (LDR) radiation using 57Co plates was delivered whole-body to mature, 6-month old female C57BL/6 mice to simulate the radiation component. A total dose of 0.04 Gy was delivered at a rate of 0.01 cGy/h over a period of 21 days; uniformity of dose was at ±5%. Mice receiving 0 Gy were handled similarly. Anti-orthostatic tail suspension was used to model the unloading, fluid shift, and physiological stress aspects of the microgravity component. Mice were hindlimb suspended and/or irradiated for 21 days. For combination group, mice were irradiated during tail suspension. Tissues were collected at 7 days, 1, 4, and 9 months following simulated microgravity. Cobalt-57 produces photons at three energies: 0.122 MeV (86%), 0.136 MeV (11%), 0.014 MeV (9%). Ionizing radiation energy values were added by GeneLab.     Brain samples were preserved in LN2 following isolation.     Nuclueic acid extractions for RNAseq and RRBS: AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (Qiagen, #80224) was used to perform RNA and DNA extractions. Frozen brain tissues were homogenized in 600 ul of RLT lysis buffer containing 1 % B-mercaptoethanol. Tissue homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix (Tissue homogenizing CKMix, Precellys) on Minilys (Bertin Technologies). Tubes were centrifuged for 1 min at 20,000 x g to reduce bubbles/foam. The homogenized lysate was transferred to an AllPrep DNA Mini spin column placed in a 2 ml collection tube and centrifuged for 30 s at full speed (maximum speed of 20,000 x g). The flow-through (containing the RNA) was transferred into a new 2 ml microcentrifuge for RNA purification. 80 ul Proteinase K was added to the flow-through (RNA) and mixed by pipetting. 350 ul of 100 % Ethanol was added and mixed and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. 750 ul 100% ethanol was then added, mixed and transferred to an RNeasy Mini spin column placed in a 2 ml collection tube and centrifuged for 15 s at 20,000 x g. This step was repeated until the entire sample passed through the column. The flow-through was discarded. 500 ul of Buffer RPE was added to the RNeasy Mini spin column, centrifuged for 15 s at full speed (20,000 x g) and the flow-through discarded.10 ul DNase I stock solution was diluted in 70 ul Buffer RDD mixed gently and the 80 ul incubation mix was added to the spin column and kept for 15 minutes at room temperature. 500 ul Buffer FRN was then added to the RNeasy Mini spin column and centrifuged for 15 s at 20,000 x g. The flow-through (containing small RNAs) was re-applied to the spin column and centrifuged. The flow-through was then discarded. 500 ul Buffer RPE was then added to the RNeasy Mini spin column and centrifuged for 15 s at 20,000 x g. 500 ul of 100 % ethanol was added to the RNeasy Mini spin column and centrifuged for 2 min at 20,000 x g. The flow-through and the collection tube were discarded. Centrifugation was repeated with new collection tubes. The RNeasy Mini spin column was placed in a new 1.5 ml collection tube and 30 ul (for retina) or 60 ul (for brain) of RNase-free water was added directly to the spin column membrane and centrifuged for 1 min at 10000 x g to elute the RNA. The eluate was re-applied to the column and centrifuged again to increase the RNA yield from the column. RNA concentration was measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA samples were stored at -80 C until library construction.  The AllPrep DNA Mini spin column (containing the DNA) was processed for DNA purification according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 350 ul Buffer AW1 was added to the AllPrep DNA Mini spin column and centrifuged for 15 s at 20,000 x g to wash the spin column membrane. The flow-through was discarded. 20 ul Proteinase K was added to 60 ul Buffer AW1, mix gently, applied to the AllPrep DNA Mini spin column membrane and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. 350 ul Buffer AW1 was then added to the AllPrep DNA Mini spin column and centrifuged for 15 s at 20,000 x g and flow-through was discarded. 500 ul Buffer AW2 was then added to the AllPrep DNA Mini spin column and centrifuged for 2 min at full speed to wash the spin column membrane and the flow-through was discarded. The AllPrep DNA Mini spin column was placed in a new 1.5 ml collection tube and 30 ul (for retina) or 60 ul (for brain) of buffer EB was added directly to the spin column membrane and centrifuged for 1 min at 10000 x g to elute the DNA. The eluate was re-applied to the column and centrifuged again to increase the DNA yield from the column. DNA concentration was measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). DNA samples were stored at -80 C until library construction.  RNA extraction for microarray: Total RNA of each tissue was extracted with the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, #74104) according to specifications. RNA integrity and concentration were checked by Agilent NanoRNA Chip (Bio-Analyser, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). A minimum RNA Integrity Number of 7.6 was required for all samples.     For RNA-Seq library construction, 100 ng of total RNA was used as input spiked with 1 ul (%) of 1:500 diluted ERCC ExFold Spike-In Mix 1 (Ambion/ThermoFisher Scientific, cat#4455861) with resulting total volume of 5 ul.     The Ovation Mouse RNA-Seq System 1-96 (NuGEN Technologies, #9136-A01) was used per manufacturer's instructions to construct RNA-Seq libraries. 100 ng of total RNA was used as input. First and second strands of cDNA were synthesized from total RNA spiked with 1 ul of 1:500 diluted ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mix 1 (Life Technologies) at the appropriate ratio. Following primer annealing and cDNA synthesis, the products were sheared using Covaris S220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris Inc.). 130 ul of each sample was sheared according to manufacturer's instruction. The parameters were set as follows: 10% duty factor, peak power 175 and 200 cycles per burst at 4 C for 200 seconds to obtain fragment sizes between 150-200 bp. This was followed by end-repair, adaptor index ligation and strand selection. Barcodes with unique indices out of 96 indices, was used per sample for multiplexing. Strand selection was performed by using custom InDA-C primer mixture SS5 Version5 for mice. Finally, libraries were amplified using 17 cycles (Mastercycler pro, Eppendorf) and purified with RNAClean XP Agencourt beads.     RNA sequencing was performed on Illumina HiSeq 4000 single read 75 bp.  DNA sequencing was performed on Illumina NextSeq 550 or HiSeq 4000 single read 70 bp. Several samples were re-sequenced to get enough reads and the CFG s were kept the same for the same sample across repeated sequence runs.     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 96, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads from 3 samples were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.0.3) with tximport (version 1.18.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.30.0). The data was normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.30.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.2.0), PANTHER.db (v1.0.10), and org.Mm.eg.db (v3.12.0).     Biotinylated cRNA were prepared.     Three hundred nanograms of total RNA were amplified and purified using Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion, Cat# IL1791) following kit instructions. Briefly, first strand cDNA was synthesized by incubating RNA with T7 oligo(dT) primer and reverse transcriptase mix at 42 C for 2 h. RNase H and DNA polymerase master mix were immediately added into the reaction mix following reverse transcription and were incubated for 2 hours at 16 C to synthesize second strand cDNA. RNA, primers, enzymes and salts that would inhibit in vitro transcription were removed through cDNA filter cartridges (part of the amplification kit). In vitro transcription was performed and biotinylated cRNA was synthesized by a 14 hour amplification with dNTP mix containing biotin-dUTP and T7 RNA polymerase. Amplified cRNA was subsequently purified and concentration was measured by NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, DE). An aliquot of 750 nanograms of amplified products were loaded onto Illumina Sentrix Beadchip Array MouseRef8_V2 arrays, hybridized at 58 C in an Illumina Hybridization Oven (Illumina, Cat# 198361) for 17 hours, washed and incubated with streptavidin-Cy3 for 10 min to detect biotin-labeled cRNA on the arrays.     Arrays were dried and scanned with a BeadArray Reader (Illumina, CA) and raw data were captured.     DNA Methylation and Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) library construction. We processed 100 ng of isolated gDNA to generate RRBS DNA library using the Ovation RRBS Methyl-Seq System (NuGEN Technologies, #0353-32) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the methylation insensitive MspI enzyme, which cuts the DNA at CCGG sites, was used to digest gDNA into fragments. The fragments were directly subjected to end blunting and phosphorylation in preparation for ligation to a methylated adapter with a single-base T overhang. A unique index, out of 96 indices, was used per sample for multiplexing. The ligation products were final repaired in a thermal cycler under the program (60 C for 10 min, 70 C for 10 min, hold at 4 C). The product of the final repair reaction was used for bisulfite conversion using kit QIAGEN EpiTect Fast DNA Bisulfite Kit according to Qiagen's protocol. Bisulfite-converted DNA was then amplified (Mastercycler pro, Eppendorf) and bead-purified with Agencourt RNAClean XP Beads.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Spleen tissue was processed with Trizol according to the manufacturer's instructions.     One microgram of high-quality total RNA was used for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) library construction using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with the following modification: one minute fragmentation time was applied to allow for longer RNA fragments. The obtained RNA-seq libraries were analyzed with the 2100 Bioanalyzer. The tissue sample described previously was then subjected to size selection and designated “size selected”. Selection of sequences 375–900 nucleotides (nt) in length (275–800 nt sequences plus 50 nt sequencing adaptors on each end of the cDNA) was performed using the Pippin Prep system (Sage Science, Beverly, MA, USA). All libraries were then quantified with qPCR according to Illumina recommendations.     Total RNA was sequenced on the Illumia MiSeq 2x300 nucleotide platform at the Kansas State University Integrated Genomics Facility. Thirty-two spleen samples were sequenced, two from each AOS trial for a total of four animals per treatment group. Samples were selected for sequencing based on highest RIN scores.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on Sept-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.3 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.3/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).     Ten-week-old female, C57BL/6J mice were unloaded using antiorthostatic tail suspension. Ten animals were included in each treatment group. Unsuspended controls were housed in identical cages with tail restraint, but no unloading. Animals were subjected to AOS for two weeks and then immunized with intraperitoneal injection of saline, 5 LF/mL tetanus toxoid (TT) with a 0.1 mL injection volume, 0.4 mg/mL CpG ODN 1826 in 0.1(CpG) with a 0.1 mL injection volume, or both TT and CpG with a 0.2mL injection volume.     Two weeks post immunization, a standardized collection assembly-line was used to euthanize the animals and collect the tissue to minimize experimental variation. Animals from each of eight treatment groups were randomly sacrificed using 100% CO2 followed by cervical dislocation on four different collection dates; two consecutive collection days per experiment, 20 mice per day. Blood, spleen and bone marrow were collected first as primary science for this experiment with other tissues collected thereafter. Tissues including spleen were collected and snap frozen in liquid N2. Samples were stored in -80C prior to analysis.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Low-dose/Low-dose-rate (LDR) radiation using 57Co plates was delivered whole-body to mature, 6-month old female C57BL/6 mice to simulate the radiation component. A total dose of 0.04 Gy was delivered at a rate of 0.01 cGy/h over a period of 21 days; uniformity of dose was at ±5%. Mice receiving 0 Gy were handled similarly. Anti-orthostatic tail suspension was used to model the unloading, fluid shift, and physiological stress aspects of the microgravity component. Mice were hindlimb suspended and/or irradiated for 21 days. For combination group, mice were irradiated during tail suspension. Tissues were collected at 7 days, 1 and 4 months following simulated microgravity. Cobalt-57 produces photons at three energies: 0.122 MeV (86%), 0.136 MeV (11%), 0.014 MeV (9%). Ionizing radiation energy values were added by GeneLab.     Eye samples were preserved in LN2 following isolation. Frozen whole eye samples were microdissected in ice-cold PBS. Fine spring scissors were used to separate the cornea from the sclera to access the retina. The retina was carefully detached from the sclera. The retina, cornea, and lens were immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at -80 C until DNA/RNA isolation.     AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (Qiagen, #80224) was used to perform RNA and DNA extractions. Frozen brain tissues were homogenized in 600 ul of RLT lysis buffer containing 1 % B-mercaptoethanol. Tissue homogenization was performed using tissue homogenizing bead mix (Tissue homogenizing CKMix, Precellys) on Minilys (Bertin Technologies). Tubes were centrifuged for 1 min at 20, 000 g to reduce bubbles/foam. The homogenized lysate was transferred to an AllPrep DNA Mini spin column placed in a 2 ml collection tube and centrifuged for 30 s at full speed (maximum speed of 20,000 x g). The flow-through (containing the RNA) was transferred into a new 2 ml microcentrifuge for RNA purification. 80 ul Proteinase K was added to the flow-through (RNA) and mixed by pipetting. 350 ul of 100 % Ethanol was added and mixed and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature.750 ul 100% ethanol was then added, mixed and transferred to an RNeasy Mini spin column placed in a 2 ml collection tube and centrifuged for 15 s at 20,000 x g. This step was repeated until the entire sample passed through the column. The flow-through was discarded. 500 ul of Buffer RPE was added to the RNeasy Mini spin column, centrifuged for 15 s at full speed (20,000 x g) and the flow-through discarded.10 ul DNase I stock solution was diluted in 70 ul Buffer RDD mixed gently and the 80 ul incubation mix was added to the spin column and kept for 15 minutes at room temperature. 500 ul Buffer FRN was then added to the RNeasy Mini spin column and centrifuged for 15 s at 20,000 x g. The flow-through (containing small RNAs) was re-applied to the spin column and centrifuged. The flow-through was then discarded. 500 ul Buffer RPE was then added to the RNeasy Mini spin column and centrifuged for 15 s at 20,000 x g. 500 ul of 100% ethanol was added to the RNeasy Mini spin column and centrifuged for 2 min at 20,000 x g. The flow-through and the collection tube were discarded. Centrifugation was repeated with new collection tubes. The RNeasy Mini spin column was placed in a new 1.5 ml collection tube and 30 ul (for retina) or 60 ul (for brain) of RNase-free water was added directly to the spin column membrane and centrifuged for 1 min at 10000 x g to elute the RNA. The eluate was re-applied to the column and centrifuged again to increase the RNA yield from the column. RNA concentration was measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA samples were stored at -80 C until library construction.  The AllPrep DNA Mini spin column (containing the DNA) was processed for DNA purification according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 350 ul Buffer AW1 was added to the AllPrep DNA Mini spin column and centrifuged for 15 s at 20,000 x g to wash the spin column membrane. The flow-through was discarded. 20 ul Proteinase K was added to 60 ul Buffer AW1, mix gently, applied to the AllPrep DNA Mini spin column membrane and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. 350 ul Buffer AW1 was then added to the AllPrep DNA Mini spin column and centrifuged for 15 s at 20,000 x g and flow-through was discarded. 500 ul Buffer AW2 was then added to the AllPrep DNA Mini spin column and centrifuged for 2 min at full speed to wash the spin column membrane and the flow-through was discarded. The AllPrep DNA Mini spin column was placed in a new 1.5 ml collection tube and 30 ul (for retina) or 60 ul (for brain) of buffer EB was added directly to the spin column membrane and centrifuged for 1 min at 10000 x g to elute the DNA. The eluate was re-applied to the column and centrifuged again to increase the DNA yield from the column. DNA concentration was measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). DNA samples were stored at -80 C until library construction.     For RNA-Seq library construction, 100 ng of total RNA was used as input spiked with 1 ul (1%) of 1:500 diluted ERCC ExFold Spike-In Mix 1 (Ambion/ThermoFisher Scientific, cat#4455861) with resulting total volume of 5 uls.     The Ovation Mouse RNA-Seq System 1-96 (NuGEN Technologies, #9136-A01) was used per manufacturer's instructions to construct RNA-Seq libraries. 100 ng of total RNA was used as input. First and second strands of cDNA were synthesized from total RNA spiked with 1 ul of 1:500 diluted ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mix 1 (Life Technologies) at the appropriate ratio. Following primer annealing and cDNA synthesis, the products were sheared using Covaris S220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris Inc.). 130 ul of each sample was sheared according to manufacturer's instruction. The parameters were set as follows: 10% duty factor, peak power 175 and 200 cycles per burst at 4 C for 200 seconds to obtain fragment sizes between 150-200 bp. This was followed by end-repair, adaptor index ligation and strand selection. Barcodes with unique indices out of 96 indices, was used per sample for multiplexing. Strand selection was performed by using custom InDA-C primer mixture SS5 Version5 for mice. Finally, libraries were amplified using 17 cycles (Mastercycler pro, Eppendorf) and purified with RNAClean XP Agencourt beads.     RNA sequencing was performed on Illumina Hiseq4000 single read 75 bp.  DNA sequencing was performed on Illumina Hiseq4000 single read 70 bp. Several samples were re-sequenced to get enough reads and the CFG#s were kept the same for the same sample across repeated sequence runs.     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 96, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads from 3 samples were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.0.3) with tximport (version 1.18.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.30.0). The data was normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.30.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.2.0), PANTHER.db (v1.0.10), and org.Mm.eg.db (v3.12.0).     DNA Methylation and Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) library construction. We processed 100 ng of isolated gDNA to generate RRBS DNA library using the Ovation RRBS Methyl-Seq System (NuGEN Technologies, #0353-32) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the methylation insensitive MspI enzyme, which cuts the DNA at CCGG sites, was used to digest gDNA into fragments. The fragments were directly subjected to end blunting and phosphorylation in preparation for ligation to a methylated adapter with a single-base T overhang. A unique index, out of 96 indices, was used per sample for multiplexing. The ligation products were final repaired in a thermal cycler under the program (60 C for 10 min, 70 C for 10 min, hold at 4 C). The product of the final repair reaction was used for bisulfite conversion using kit QIAGEN EpiTect Fast DNA Bisulfite Kit according to Qiagen's protocol. Bisulfite-converted DNA was then amplified (Mastercycler pro, Eppendorf) and bead-purified with Agencourt RNAClean XP Beads.",

The Mlh1+/− strain B6.129-Mlh1tm1Rak/NCI was acquired from the National Cancer Institute at Frederick. All animals were bred and maintained at the CWRU Animal Research Core. All mice had ad libitum access to food (Laboratory Rodent Diet 5LOD, Lab Diet, St. Louis, MO) and water. The animal housing room was maintained on a 12:12h light:dark cycle and constant temperature (72 +/- 2 F).     Particle irradiation: Adult B6.129-Mlh1tm1Rak male and female mice (~12 weeks) were shipped to BNL roughly one week prior to irradiation. The animals were divided into 10 groups of ~ 40 animals to obtain statistical power, including sham-irradiated Mlh1+/+ and Mlh1+/-. On the day of exposure, animals were arranged into an animal pie-shaped holder and placed perpendicular to a 20x20 cm beam line to expose with 10 or 100 cGy of 600 MeV/n 56Fe ions at a dose rate of 5-50 cGy/minute. Additional animals were exposed to 100 or 250 cGy of gamma-rays in a Shepherd Mark I irradiator-containing 137Cs at BNL. Animals were euthanized at first signs of morbidity and tumors were collected. All tumors were fixed in 10% formaldehyde for 24 hours followed by immersion into 70% ethanol until processed and sectioned.     Genomic DNA was extracted from FFPE tumors.     Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was carried out by using a Truseq Exome library prep kit according to manufacturer's protocol.     A 2x75 base-pair HS run was performed using an Illumina HiSeq 2500.

          "Study Description": "Cancer-causing genome instability is a major concern during space travel due to exposure of astronauts to potent sources of high-linear energy transfer (LET) ionizing radiation. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are particularly susceptible to genotoxic stress, and accumulation of damage can lead to HSC dysfunction and oncogenesis. Our group recently demonstrated that aging human HSCs accumulate microsatellite instability coincident with loss of MLH1, a DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR) protein, which could reasonably predispose to radiation-induced HSC malignancies. Therefore, in an effort to reduce risk uncertainty for cancer development during deep space travel, we employed an Mlh1+/- mouse model to study the effects high-LET 56Fe ion space-like radiation. Irradiated Mlh1+/- mice showed a significantly higher incidence of lymphomagenesis with 56Fe ions compared to Î³-rays and unirradiated mice, and malignancy correlated with increased MSI in the tumors. In addition, whole-exome sequencing analysis revealed high SNVs and INDELs in lymphomas being driven by loss of Mlh1 and frequently mutated genes had a strong correlation with human leukemias. Therefore, the data suggest that age-related MMR deficiencies could lead to HSC malignancies after space radiation, and that countermeasure strategies will be required to adequately protect the astronaut population on the journey to Mars.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "6-month and 22-24 month old male C57BL/6J mice were obtained from the National Institute on Aging rodent colony (Charles River Laboratories, Madison, WI). Young and aged animals were divided into the following experimental groups: 10-day of hind limb unloading (UN), 10-day of hind limb unloading followed by 3 days of reloading recovery (RL), and control (CON). Mice were fed ad libitum with a standard chow diet ( 2916, Harlan-Teklad, Houston, Tx) and water/hydrogel (ClearH2O, Westbrook, ME, US) and housed at 22C with a 12-h light/dark cycle.     After 10 days of UN, RL, or CON, the mice were fasted for 4 hours and euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation and cervical dislocation, or anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (IP administration, 50 mg/kg) for muscle harvested for metabolomics analysis. The soleus, gastrocnemius, and quadriceps femoris muscle groups were immediately harvested and weighed. The soleus muscle from right hind limb was used for fresh tissue assay immediately and other muscles were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for other analysis. Separate experiments were conducted for cardiometabolic phenotyping, permeabilized fiber bundle assays, RNA analysis, immunoblots, and metabolomics/lipidomics.     Soleus were removed, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and RNA was harvested using Trizol reagent. Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit (Cat#FC-122-1001) was used with 1 ug of total RNA for the construction of sequencing libraries. The quality of Total RNA was assessed by the Agilent Bioanalyzer Nano chip (Agilent Technologies).     1ug of Total RNA was used as starting material to construct RNA Seq library using Illumina's Truseq Stranded Total RNA Library preparation kit as per the instructions. First the total RNA is Ribo depleted to remove rRNA from total RNA. The remaining non-rRNA is fragmented into small pieces using divalent cations under elevated temperature. Following fragmentation, the first strand cDNA were synthesized using random primers and followed by second strand synthesis using DNA Polymerase I. The cDNA is then ligated with index adapters for each sample followed by purification and then enriched with PCR to create the final library. The quality and quantity of the libraries were detected by Agilent Bioanalyzer and Kapa Biosystems qPCR. The quality and quantity of the libraries were detected by Agilent Bioanalyzer and Kapa Biosystems qPCR.     Multiplexed libraries are pooled and single-end 50-bp sequencing was performed on one flow-cell of an Illumina Hiseq 2500.     Reads from 36 samples (40 raw files) were mapped to mouse genome, mm10, using tophat 2.0.1 (https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml), mapped reads were filtered based on the mapping quality. The overall mapping rates were about 90%. mRNA quantification and normalization was done using Partek Genomics Suite 6.6, annotation database using RefSeq Transcript 77 July 2016 . R package DeSeq (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq.html) was used to analyze the differential expression of mRNAs. Genome_build: mm10 Supplementary_files_format_and_content: tab-delimited text files include RPKM values for each Sample     For samples with multiple raw fastq files, fastq files were concatenated together to create one fastq.gz file per sample. Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.4/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

After a 10 day period of unloading, mice in this study were “reloaded” for 3 days and regained use of their hind limbs. We report the application of Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology for high-throughput profiling of mRNA in soleus muscle of adult (6 mo) and aged (22-24 mo) mice. Our goal was to determine the effects of hind limb unloading and reloading on mRNA profiles in soleus muscle and compare between adult and aged mice. We find that there are distinct response in the profile of fatty acid oxidation, TCA cycle, ETC oxidative phosphorylation gene expression patterns in response to unloading and reloading. The responses are generally similar between young and old mice.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "     At birth, pups were weighed and put to death by decapitation between 8 and 10 am to avoid fluctuations of corticosterone concentrations caused by circadian rhythm. Blood samples collected during decapitation were allowed to clot at ambient temperature for 15 min and then centrifuged at 4C and 4000 rpm for 20 min to collect serum samples that were stored at minus 80C until analysis. Tails were frozen at minus 80C until analysis. Thymuses were immediately dissociated in PBS-fetal bovine serum 2% buffer. Thymocytes were then counted with a Scepter 2.0 Cell Counter (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA); 1.5 x 10^6 cells were used for flow cytometry analyses and 10^7 cells for RNA extraction.     For each extraction 10^7 Thymocyte cells were used.  The variable diversity joining rearrangements contained in newborn TCR-beta heavy chain mRNAs were amplified by 5 rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR using the Smarter RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Takara Bio, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA). In brief, for the 2 CUMS and control experiments, equal amounts of total RNA extracted from the thymus of 6 CUMS males (3 randomly chosen in 2 different litters) were mixed and reverse transcribed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The same method was used with RNA extracted from the thymus of 6 CUMS females, 6 control males and 6 control females. Then, 2 successive PCRs were performed to amplify TCR-beta VDJ associations in control and CUMS samples of both genders. The first PCR was performed with gene-specific primer (GSP)-1, which anneals to the first constant domain of C-beta-1 and C-beta-2 and the universal primer mix (UPM) of the kit. The second PCR was performed on an aliquot of the first PCR using another gene-specific primer (GSP-2), which anneals upstream of GSP-1 in the first constant domain of C-beta-1 and C-beta-2, and the nested universal primer (NUP), which anneals to UPM. PCR products generated by the second PCR were separated on an agarose gel, and those of the expected size were purified with the Nucleospin Gel and PCR Clean-up Kit (Macherey Nagel).     libraries were prepared by adding Illumina adapter sequences (NEBNext Index Primer; Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) by PCR.     High Throughput Sequencing of these libraries was conducted from both ends to get the entire sequences of variable (diversity) joining [VDJ] rearrangements using the MiSeq Illumina apparatus of the FR3209 research federation (Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France) following Illumina's standard protocol.\n\nNote: The forward and reverse raw data files submitted were merged and non-overlapping sequences were removed.     Experiments were conducted on 10-wk-old C57BL/6N mice provided by Charles River Laboratories (Bois des Oncins, Saint-Germain-Nuelles, France). On arrival, animals were housed for 2 wk in standard cages under controlled conditions in the animal facility of the INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche 894 laboratory (Paris, France). These conditions were as follows: animals were provided food and water ad libitum in a quiet room with constant temperature (22C), 50% relative humidity, and 12-h light-dark cycles (dark period 8 pm-8 am). Females and males were then mated by placing 4 females with a different male every day for 3 d. Females were then randomly divided into 2 groups: 1 control group housed in standard cages in groups of 2 and 1 group of mice individually subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stressors: CUMS. CUMS exposure extended up to the postpartum day. This experiment was performed twice. The first experiment generated 28 control pups and 29 CUMS pups. The second experiment generated 24 control pups and 31 CUMS pups.\nMice of the CUMS groups were subjected to 6 different unpredictable mild socioenvironmental stressors: 30 degree cage tilt for 1, 2, or 15 h; confinement in a small cage (11 x 8 x 8 cm) for 1 or 2 h; paired housing for 2 h; one 15 h overnight period with difficult access to food without a reduction in the daily food ration; one 15-h overnight period with permanent light; and one 15-h overnight period in a soiled cage (50 ml of water in 1000 ml of bedding). These stressors were delivered according to Pardon et al. and Gaignier et al. Stress periods that lasted 1 h in the morning, 2 h in the afternoon, and 15 h at night (6 pm-9 am) were always separated by stress-free intervals of at least 2 h to avoid any habituation process. Animals were also placed on a reversed light/dark cycle between Friday evening and Monday morning. This procedure was scheduled over a 1-wk period and repeated throughout the 3 wk of experimentation. The control group was left undisturbed in another room of the animal facility, with 2 mice per standard cage (37.5 x 21.5 x 18 cm).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Rats were housed in autoclaved cages and maintained in a room with a controlled temperature (23 ± 1 °C) and humidity (50 ± 5%) under a regular 12-hours light, 12-hours dark cycle. They were fed a standard laboratory animal diet (CE-2; Clea Japan, Tokyo, Japan) and sterilized water ad libitum.     Rats were left untreated or were subjected to whole-body 137Cs gamma-irradiation (4 Gy, 0.5 Gy/min) at 7 weeks of age. Cesium-137 produces gamma rays with an energy of 0.662 MeV and has a half-life of 30.1 years. Ionizing radiation energy values were added by GeneLab. GeneLab calculated exposure duration based on absorbed radiation dose and dose rate.     The treated rats were observed daily and palpated weekly beginning 2 weeks after irradiation to identify mammary tumors. Animals that had generally deteriorated during the observation period, defined as body mass loss and severe anemia owing to tumor burden, were euthanized and any mammary tumors collected, as were tumors discovered post-mortem in rats that were found dead. Mammary tumors and normal glands both from the same tumor-bearing rats were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.     RNA was prepared using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer's recommendations.     Cyanine-3 (Cy3) labeled cRNA was prepared from 0.2 ug RNA using the Low Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by RNeasy column purification (QIAGEN). Dye incorporation and cRNA yield were checked with the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer.     0.6 ug of Cy3-labelled cRNA (specific activity greater than 6.0 pmol Cy3/ug cRNA) was fragmented at 60C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 25 ul containing Agilent fragmentation buffer and Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturer's instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 25 ul of 2x Agilent hybridization buffer was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to Agilent SurePrint G3 Rat GE 8x60K Microarray for 17 hours at 65C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent).     Slides were scanned immediately after washing on the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2565CA) using one color scan setting for 8x60k array slides (Scan Area 61x21.6 mm, Scan resolution 3 um, Dye channel is set to Green and Green PMT is set to 100%).\n     The scanned images were analyzed with Feature Extraction Software 10.7.3.1 (Agilent) using default parameters (protocol GE1_107_Sep09 and Grid: 028279_D_F_20120224). Signal intensity data were normalized using Lowess normalization. Features flagged in Feature Extraction as Feature Non-uniform outliers were excluded.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7112 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Agilent_1-channel/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7112_Versions/GL-DPPD-7112.md), using NF_MAAgilent1ch version 1.0.1 (GitHub link coming soon). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.1). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3). Raw data quality assurance density, pseudo image, MA, and foreground-background plots were generated using limma (version 3.50.3), and boxplots were generated using ggplot2 (version 3.4.0). The raw intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the limma (version 3.50.3) quantile method. Normalized data quality assurance density, pseudo image, and MA plots were generated using limma (version 3.50.3), and boxplots were generated using using ggplot2 (version 3.4.0). Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probe using biomaRt (version 2.50.0), Ensembl database (ensembl.org, release 107). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probe to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned for every probe that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Rn.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Rats were housed in autoclaved cages and maintained in a room with a controlled temperature (23 +- 1ºC) and humidity (50 +- 5%) under a regular 12-hours light, 12-hours dark cycle. They were fed a standard laboratory animal diet (CE-2; Clea Japan, Tokyo, Japan) and sterilized water ad libitum.     Rats were left untreated or were subjected to whole-body 137Cs gamma-irradiation (4 Gy, 0.5 Gy/min) at 7 weeks of age. Cesium-137 produces gamma rays with an energy of 0.662 MeV and has a half-life of 30.1 years. Ionizing radiation energy values were added by GeneLab. GeneLab calculated exposure duration based on absorbed radiation dose and dose rate.     The treated rats were observed daily and palpated weekly beginning 2 weeks after irradiation to identify mammary tumors. Animals that had generally deteriorated during the observation period, defined as body mass loss and severe anemia owing to tumor burden, were euthanized and any mammary tumors collected, as were tumors discovered post-mortem in rats that were found dead. Mammary tumors and normal glands both from the same tumor-bearing rats were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.     Genomic DNA was isolated by proteinase K digestion, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction.     Labeling reactions with Cyanine 5-UTP and Cyanine 3-UTP were performed according to the Agilent Genomic DNA Labeling Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).     Labeled DNAs (3.5 ug) were combined and mixed with rat Cot-1 DNA (10 mM final concentration; Applied Genetics Laboratories, Melbourne, FL, USA), the Agilent Blocking Agent, de-ionized formamide, and the Agilent Hybridization Buffer at 67 C for 40 hours.     Scanned on an Agilent microarray scanner.     Normalized log2 ratio (Cy5/Cy3)",

          "Study Protocol Description": "For spleen cells, spleens were removed from four 11-week-old, specific pathogen-free, female C57BL/6J mice housed in the Division of Biology vivarium at Kansas State University. One-half of each spleen was homogenized with a 70 uM sieve to generate a single-cell suspension designated 'cells'.  Spleen cells were pelleted at 350 x g and were resuspended in 5 mL of ice-cold ACK lysing buffer (155mM NH4Cl, 10mM KHC03, 0.1mM EDTA) to lyse red blood cells. After five minutes, 10 mL of ice-cold isotonic medium was added to the suspension and cells were again pelleted at 350 x g and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was resuspended in Trizol LS (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for RNA extraction.\n\nFor spleen tissues, spleens were removed from four 11-week-old, specific pathogen-free, female C57BL/6J mice housed in the Division of Biology vivarium at Kansas State University. One-half of each spleen was immediately placed into Trizol LS for RNA extraction, and designated 'tissues'.\n\nFor whole spleens, spleens were removed from four 9-to-11 week-old, specific pathogen-free, female C57BL/6J mice that were recently purchased from Jackson Labs.  These were housed in the Division of Biology vivarium at Kansas State University for 14-31 days prior to sacrifice.  Each whole spleen was immediately placed into Trizol LS for RNA extraction, and designated 'tissues'.     RNA extraction was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNAsin (40 units) was added to each RNA aliquot and stored in -80 C. RNA quality was assessed on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).  Equal concentrations of RNA from each of the four mice was pooled together.     Library Construction 1:\nOne microgram of high-quality total RNA was used for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) library construction using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with the following modification: one minute fragmentation time was applied to allow for longer RNA fragments. The obtained RNA-seq libraries were analyzed with the 2100 Bioanalyzer.  All libraries were then quantified with qPCR according to Illumina recommendations.\n\nLibrary Construction 2:\nOne microgram of high-quality total RNA was used for further preparation and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Library construction using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with the following modification: one minute fragmentation time was applied to allow for longer RNA fragments. The obtained RNA-seq libraries were analyzed with the 2100 Bioanalyzer. RNA from the spleen tissue was subjected to size selection to select for sequences 375-900 nucleotides (nt) in length (275-800 nt sequences plus 50 nt sequencing adaptors on each end of the cDNA) was performed using the Pippin Prep system (Sage Science, Beverly, MA, USA). All libraries were then quantified with qPCR according to Illumina recommendations.     The sequencing was performed at the Kansas State University Integrated Genomics Facility on the MiSeq personal sequencing system (Illumina) using the 600 cycles MiSeq reagent v3 kit (Illumina) according to Illumina instructions, resulting in 2 x 300 nt reads     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 96, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads from 3 samples were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.0.3) with tximport (version 1.18.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.30.0). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.30.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.2.0), PANTHER.db (v1.0.10), and org.Mm.eg.db (v3.12.0).",

          "Study Description": "Spaceflight is known to affect immune cell populations. In particular, splenic B-cell numbers decrease during spaceflight and in ground-based physiological models. Although antibody isotype changes have been assessed during and after spaceflight, an extensive characterization of the impact of spaceflight on antibody composition has not been conducted in mice. Next Generation Sequencing and bioinformatic tools are now available to assess antibody repertoires. We can now identify immunoglobulin gene- segment usage, junctional regions, and modifications that contribute to specificity and diversity. Due to limitations on the International Space Station, alternate sample collection and storage methods must be employed. Our group compared Illumina MiSeq sequencing data from multiple sample preparation methods in normal C57Bl/6J mice to validate that sample preparation and storage would not bias the outcome of antibody repertoire characterization. In this report, we also compared sequencing techniques and a bioinformatic workflow on the data output when we assessed the IgH and Igκ variable gene usage. Our bioinformatic workflow has been optimized for Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq datasets, and is designed specifically to reduce bias, capture the most information from Ig sequences, and produce a data set that provides other data mining options.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Immediately upon removal from -80C storage, cell pellets were suspended in 100 L of 0.25% RapiGest (Waters Corp.) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. This volume was pipetted up and down several times to lyse the cell pellet, and then each was transferred to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf low-bind tube. An additional 100 L of 0.25% RapiGest was added to each conical tube as a rinse and added to the first 100 L aliquot. Tubes were then re-frozen at -80C for 10 min, removed from freezer, and thawed on ice. This freeze/thaw cycle was repeated. Each sample was probe sonicated for 3 cycles of 5 s bursts at power level 3, cooling on ice between bursts. Samples were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min, and a very small pellet was visible at the bottom of each tube. Protein concentrations were determined by mini-Bradford assay (BioRad, Inc.) against a bovine serum albumin (BSA) calibration curve. 25 g from each sample was removed (volumes based on concentration), and added to new 0.5 L tubes. Then each sample was normalized to 86.2 L total with 0.25% RapiGest (based on the sample with the lowest concentration). Samples were then digested according to the in-solution tryptic digestion protocol detailed here: http://www.genome.duke.edu/cores/proteomics/sample-preparation/. Briefly, samples were reduced to 10 mM dithiothreitol final for 15 min at 80C while shaking and alkylated to 20 mM iodoacetamide final for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Sequencing grade porcine trypsin was added at 1:50 enzyme: protein ratio and samples were incubated at 37C overnight while shaking. Following overnight digestion, RapiGest surfactant was hydrolyzed by addition of 1% TFA/2% ACN final. All samples were also spiked with ADH1_YEAST digest (Massprep standard, Waters Corp.) as a surrogate standard (50fmol ADH per g total protein). All samples were heated at 60C for 2 h and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min before pipetting all supernatant into individual TotalRecovery LC vials (Waters, Corp.). 3 L was pipetted from each and combined to make a pool for QC purposes.     label-free quantification     Before each replicate group queue, 1 g from the pooled sample was injected, and was also injected 4 at the end of the queue, for a total of 7 QC pool runs. One of the seven pooled analyses was run in data-dependent acquisition mode (DDA) for complementary peptide identifications whereas the others were performed as follows.\n\nQuantitative LC/MS/MS was performed on 1 g of protein digest per sample, using a nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters Corp) coupled to a Synapt G2 HDMS high resolution accurate mass tandem mass spectrometer (Waters Corp.) via a nanoelectrospray ionization source. Briefly, the sample was first trapped on a Symmetry C18 300 mm  180 mm trapping column (5 l/min at 99.9/0.1 v/v water/acetonitrile), after which the analytical separation was performed using a 1.7 m Acquity BEH130 C18 75 mm  250 mm column (Waters Corp.) using a 90-min gradient of 5 to 40% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 400 nanoliters/minute (nL/min) with a column temperature of 55C. Data collection on the Synapt G2 mass spectrometer was performed in ion-mobility assisted data-independent acquisition (HDDIA or HDMSE) mode, using 0.6 s alternating cycle time between low (6 V) and high (2750 V) collision energy (CE). Scans performed at low CE measure peptide accurate mass and intensity (abundance), while scans at elevated CE allow for qualitative identification of the resulting peptide fragments via database searching. The total analysis cycle time for each sample injection was approximately 1.5 h.     Following the 28 analyses (with the additional QC standard injections), data was imported into Rosetta Elucidator v3.3 (Rosetta Biosoftware, Inc.), and all LC-MS files were aligned based on the accurate mass and retention time of detected ions (features) using PeakTeller algorithm (Elucidator). The relative peptide abundance was calculated based on area-under-the-curve (AUC) of aligned features across all runs. The dataset had 280,291 quantified features and 24,433 annotated spectra. This MS/MS data was searched against a NCBI RefSeq database with rattus norvegicus taxonomy (25,485 forward entries) appended with a decoy reverse-sequence of each forward entry for false positive rate determination. The sequences for ADH_yeast, CASA1_bovin, and CASA2_bovin were also appended to the database representing internal standards used. Static mass modification corresponding to carbamidomethylation (from alkylation protocol) was required on Cys residues, whereas dynamic mass modifications corresponding to oxidation was allowed on Met residues, deamidation was allowed on Asn and Gln residues, and heavy labeled (13C15N) Arg and Lys. After individual peptide scoring using PeptideProphet algorithm (Elucidator), the data was annotated at a <1% peptide false discovery rate. This analysis yielded identifications for 6,339 peptides and 864 proteins across samples, including 493 proteins with two or more peptides quantified. For quantitative processing, only 25 of the 28 runs were used (only the 4 pooled analyses performed in the exact same way were used whereas the last 3 were excluded from quantitation). The data was first curated to contain only high-quality peptides with appropriate chromatographic peak shape, and the dataset was intensity scaled to the robust median across all samples analyzed; the final quantitative dataset was based on 6,174 peptides and contained 848 proteins.     NRCMs were isolated from ventricles of 2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories) as previously reported. Following isolation, NRCMs were plated on 100mm tissue culture dishes. Cells were collected by trypsinization, exchanged into DMEM:F12 SILAC media (Thermo Scientific; prepared as previously described (49), and seeded onto Cytodex-3 microcarrier beads (Sigma). Normal gravity (1xg) cells were plated on tissue culture dishes containing 10ml SILAC media. Simulated g cells were transferred to rotating wall vessels (RWV; Synthecon, Inc., Houston, TX) containing 10ml SILAC media. Initially, the cell-bead mixture was allowed to sit in the RWV for 2h to enhance cell attachment prior to rotation. Both the 1xg and g cells were cultured for 12, 48, and 120 h, with fresh media added every 48h. NRCMs were collected by trypsinization, washed three times in 50mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0), pelleted (300 xg for 2 min), flash frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80C until analysis.",

Proteomics analysis based on mass spectrometry allows for the relative quantitation of a large number of proteins concurrently, and in a relatively unbiased manner. Mass spectrometry based proteomics can be rendered even more informative by addition of a labeling component to understand the dynamics of the changing protein content. In this study, we utilized a combination of proteomics techniques, namely label-free quantification and dynamic stable-isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (Dynamic SILAC) to characterize the microgravity stress response in primary cardiomyocytes.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Seven-week-old brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) were purchased from Orient Bio (Seoul, South Korea). Rats were housed in polycarbonate cages in a room with controlled temperature (22 ± 2 C) and a 12 h light/dark cycle. The rats had access to rodent diets and filtered water ad libitum. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Korean Animal Protection Law.\nRats were divided into the following groups consisting of six rats each: (1) Group Ct (irradiation only); (2) Group TS (irradiation and tail suspension); and (3) Group DN (irradiation and denervation). Tail suspension in the TS group was performed by lifting the tail such that the hindlimbs were unloaded. Rats were maintained at an approximately 30 degree head-down tilt to ensure the forelimbs remained loaded. Sciatic nerve transection was performed in the DN group. Animals were anesthetized using constant-flow isoflurane inhalation. In each hindlimb (at the level of the femur), a small incision was made, and the sciatic nerve was isolated.     All groups of rats were exposed to continuous low dose gamma radiation using a gamma phytotron at the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, Advanced Radiation Technology Institute (Jeongeup, South Korea). Irradiation was carried out for 2 weeks with a total absorbed dose of 50 mSv. The absorbed dose was monitored using a ceric-cerous dosimeter (Bruker Instruments, Rheinstetten, Germany).     Rats were anesthetized using diethyl ether and their soleus muscles were isolated and stored at − 80 C.     Total RNA was isolated from individual frozen tissues using Trizol reagent followed instructions of the manufacturer and RNA pools were prepared for each group.     Samples were enzymatically fragmented and biotinylated using the WT Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix).     Samples were hybridized using Affymetrix hybridization kit materials: heat cocktails at 99 for 5 minutes, then 42 for 5 minutes, centrifuge at max speed for 1 minute (N.B. this deviates from Affy SOP). Transfer 200ul of hybridization solution to each array, then tape holes and parafilm. Hybridize 16 hours at 45 at 60rpm. Fluidics washing is FS450_0001.     Raw data were processed with Affymetrix Expression Console Software for background correction and normalization. RMA (Robust Muti-array Average) was used for normalization.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent, purified and treated with DNAse1 (Qiagen Rneasy kit) according to protocol. Quality was checked with Agilent Bioanalyser.     Biotinylated cDNA was synthesised with Ambion MessageAmp kit for Illumina arrays.     Standard Illumina hybridization protocol.     Data were normalized with the Lumi package of FlexArray v1.5 software and analyzed with EB Wright and Simon statistical analysis. ID_REF equals  VALUE equals FlexArray v1.5 software computed normalized signal intensity.     Standard Illumina scanning protocol.     Mice with various levels of Pthrp gene ablation (wild-type Pthrp +/+, heterozygous Pthrp +/-, and homozygous Pthrp -/-) in a C57BL/6 background were used to obtain osteoblasts. Because homozygous animals (Pthrp -/-) exhibit perinatal lethality due to skeletal and pulmonary problems, osteoblasts were collected from fetal mice of all types one day before birth. Briefly, Pthrp +/- males were bred with Pthrp +/- females, pregnant females were sacrificed by cervical dislocation one day before partum and the fetal mice collected and sacrificed by decapitation. The animals were immediately surface-sterilized in 70% ethanol, tail samples were preserved for genotyping, and femoral and cranium bones extracted immediately to obtain trabecular and calvarial osteoblast cells respectively.     The flight data was completed, confirmed and expanded using the Synthecon Revolving Cell Culture System (RCCS) Earth-based microgravity simulator consisting of a horizontally-rotating axis connected to a sterile 10-ml disposable growth chamber called High Aspect Ratio Vessel (HARV) with a CO2-permeable membrane. The equipment was used inside a standard CO2 incubator while connected to an external speed regulator and power supply. Because free, non-adherent cells would rapidly undergo anoikis-induced apoptosis, osteoblasts grown in AGD medium were trypsinised, counted, and aliquots of 10^6 cells were pre-attached to sterile MicroHex microcarriers (Nunc) using 1 ml of 50 cm^2/ml MicroHex per 10^6 cells, and incubated 4 days in AGD medium at 30°C in culture plates coated with sterile 4% agarose (Gibco) to prevent attachment. The medium was changed every second day. Primary osteoblasts attach to the surface of the microcarriers and develop in a manner similar to osteoblasts plated on standard culture plasticware except for the fact that the cells create three-dimensional connections with more than one plastic surface, resulting in microcarrier-cell aggregates. Within 24 hours of attachment at 1g, the cell/microcarrier structures assembled into clumps visible to the naked eye which mimicked the more natural cellular environment found in a living organism. After 5 days, MicroHex-attached osteoblasts (5 x 10^6) were transferred to 10-ml sterile Synthecon HARV chambers containing AGD medium which were placed inside a standard cell incubator (37°C, 5% CO2). The units were rotated at optimized speed (20 rpm) to maintain the constant free fall state characteristic of orbital flight and which is the cause of weightlessness. The rotation simulated 0g while avoiding shear forces due to excessive rotation and collision with vessel walls. Two chambers were rotated simultaneously on the same rotation axis, one containing the untreated control receiving daily medium change, the other receiving a daily 2-h PTHrP1-36 10-8M treatment followed by fresh medium. Cells on microcarriers but growing in AGD medium in agarose-coated plasticware in a standard cell culture incubator were used as 1g controls and received the same regimen of treatments or medium changes. Triplicate experiments were conducted with conditions identical to those aboard the satellite. At the end of the 6th day, cells were collected, trypsinized to release them from the microcarriers, and aliquots analysed for viability by Trypan Blue analysis. Treatment and media change conditions for 6-week experiments were identical to those lasting 6 days.",

          "Study Description": "Prolonged skeletal unloading through bedrest results in bone loss similar to that observed in elderly osteoporotic patients, but with an accelerated timeframe. This rapid effect on weight-bearing bones is also observed in astronauts who lose up to 2% of their bone mass per month spent in Space. Despite important implications for Spaceflight travellers and bedridden patients on Earth, the exact mechanisms involved in disuse osteoporosis have not been elucidated. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) regulates many physiological processes including skeletal development, and has been proposed as a gravisensor. To investigate the role of PTHrP in microgravity-induced bone loss, trabecular osteoblasts (TOs) from Pthrp+/+ and -/- mice were exposed to simulated microgravity for 6 days. Viability of TOs decreased in inverse proportion to PTHrP expression levels. Microarray analysis of Pthrp+/+ TOs after 6 days at 0g revealed expression changes in genes encoding prolactins,apoptosis and survival molecules, bone metabolism and extra-cellular matrix composition proteins, chemokines, IGF family and Wnt-related signalling molecules. Importantly, 88% of 0g-induced expression changes in Pthrp+/+ cells overlap those observed in Pthrp-/- cells in normal gravity. Pulsatile treatment with PTHrP1-36 peptide during microgravity exposure reversed a large proportion of 0g-induced changes in Pthrp+/+ TOs. Our results confirm PTHrP efficacy as an anabolic agent to prevent microgravity-induced cell death in TOs. Total RNA samples extracted from Pthrp+/+and -/- trabecular osteoblasts (TOs) exposed for 6 days to simulated 0g in Synthecon rotating cell, or left 6 days in culture at 1g. Cells had either been treated with a pulsatile treatment (2 h/day) of PTHrP1-36 peptide (10-8M) or received a change in growth medium. In total: 8 different conditions with 2 replicates each, i.e. Pthrp+/+ TOs at 0g or 1g with or without PTHrP1-36 treatment, and Pthrp-/- TOs at 0g or 1 g,with or without PTHrP1-36 treatment.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "All animals were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of Euthasol (Virbac, Fort Worth, TX) followed by cervical dislocation. All efforts were made to minimize suffering. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the NASA Ames Research Center approved the animal care and experimental procedures. Liver tissues were collected and separated into 3 groups of N equals 3 with different freezing profiles as follows: liver from the first group was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C for 3 days (Positive Control). The second group was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C for 1 year (ASAP). The third group had a delay of 25 minutes before freezing on dry ice and was stored at -80°C for 1 year (25 minutes).     Adult female C57Bl/6J mice from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) were used in all the experiments.     Homogenization buffer for DNA and RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 volumes of beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and kept on ice until use. A piece of liver weighing between 20-30 mg was cut from each liver sample and immediately placed in 800 ÂµL of the Buffer RLT solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4C and at 14,000 X g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to purify DNA and RNA via Qiagenâ€š AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). DNA was eluted twice per sample in 50 ÂµL H2O per elution. RNA was eluted twice per sample in 30 ÂµL H2O per elution. Concentration and absorbance ratios for all DNA and RNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer from Thermo Scientific (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was measured using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     Sequencing library constructions were performed by UC Davis Genome Center. RNA library construction was done with Illumina TruSeq stranded RNA library prep kit after mRNA enrichment (poly-A specific). The libraries were QC-ed by bioanalyzer and quantified by fluorometric Qubit measurements.     The RNA library sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform, three high output HiSeq lanes with 50 bp single end reads and index reads. 30 million reads per sample was requested. Performed by UC Davis Genome Center.     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 96, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the GeneLab Reference Annotations pipeline (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0). Processing scripts used can be found on GitHub here: https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/RNAseq/GLDS_Processing_Scripts/GLDS-49/GLDS_version_5     For protein homogenization the urea based protein lysis buffer consisted of 8M urea, with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, at pH 8.5 in DNase- and RNase-free H2O and was custom ordered from Teknova, Hollister, CA. This recipe was initially provided by Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS). Protease inhibitors, 1:100 volumes of 0.1 M phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride solution in ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) and 1:100 of cOmplete EDTA-free tablets (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), was added to the lysis buffer kept on ice. A piece of liver weighing between 20-30 mg was cut from each liver sample and immediately added to 650 uL protein lysis buffer. Each sample was homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4 C and at 14,000 X g to remove cell debris. A 30 uL sample of each supernatant was kept on ice for total protein concentration assay, and the rest of the supernatant was snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen in aliquots. The Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to measure the total protein concentration of each protein sample.     Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facilty using the following SUMS protocol: 50 ug were drawn from each samples defrosted on ice (samples   1-9) and for the pool sample (sample   10). The remaining sample was immediately placed back in -80°C. 25uL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0 was added to each sample, followed by 1.5 uL of 500 mM DTT, incubated at 50°C for 30 minutes and cooled to room temperature. 3uL of 1 M propionamide was added to each sample and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. 75 uL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 0.02 % protease max was added to each sample followed by 1.5 ug of trypsin/lysC (Promega) and overnight incubation at 37°C. 10 uL of 10% formic acid, 90% water was added to each sample to quench the digest. The samples were incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 5 minutes. Microspin C18 columns (NEST group, p/n SEM SS18V) were equilibrated with acetonitrile followed by 2 times wash with 0.1 % formic acid/water and each sample was cleaned and concentrated independently per vendor protocol. The eluant peptides were dried in a speed vac to less than 2uL volume and stored at 4°C prior to TMT isobaric labeling. Each peptide pool was reconstituted in 100 uL, 100 mM HEPES, pH 8.0. The TMT isobaric labels were reconstituted in 40 uL absolute ethyl alcohol and 20 uL of each isobaric tag as described above was added to the corresponding sample. The samples incubated at room temperature for 1.5hr, followed by the addition of 5 uL hydroxylamine to quench the reaction. 50 uL of each isobaric tagged peptide pool was drawn and pooled to a final volume of 500 uL, 500 uL of 0.1 % formic acid water was added to a final volume of 1mL. This fraction (~250 ug total peptide) was purified on a Water Oasis HLB 3cc C18 cartridge per vendor protocol and the final eluant dried to completion in a speed vac. SCX offline fractionation was performed using a Protea SCX column (p/n SP-155) and the provided buffers. In brief, the previously dried 10plex peptide pool was dissolved in 150 uL reconstitution solution and loaded onto the equilibrated SCX column (3 times) followed by 2 sequential washes. The elution solution provided in the kit was diluted in series to 50 mM, 100 mM, 150 mM, 200 mM, 300 mM and 400 mM (stock) concentrations. The peptides were then eluted starting with the 50mM salt concentration and collected in a new tube for the entire series. 200 uL of 0.1 % formic acid water was added to each SCX eluted fraction and each was microspin C18 purified as previously described. Each fraction was reconstituted in 20 uL 0.2 % formic acid, 2 % acetonitrile, 97.8 % water and injected for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis.     Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility. The liquid chromatography system was a Waters M-Class, where the column was an in-house packed 75uM ID with Dr. Maisch 2.4uM C18 reprosil gold to a length of 50cm. Mobile phase A was 0.2% formic acid, 5% DMSO, 94.8% water and mobile phase B was 0.2% formic acid, 5% DMSO, 94.8% acetonitrile. The gradient length were 180 minutes at a flow rate of 450nanoL/min starting at 2% B and ramping to 18% B in 122 minutes and 30% B in 150 minutes followed by a wash and re-equilibration. The mass spectrometer was an Orbitrap Fusion set to perform MS3 synchronous precursor scan analysis. In this schema precursor masses are first scanned in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 120K, followed by a MS2 event in the ion trap where the ten most intense fragment ions from the MS2 event are waveform isolated and fragmented by HCD where a purified version of the isobaric tag is used for quantification at a resolution of 60K.     Homogenization buffer for DNA and RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 volumes of beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and kept on ice until use. A piece of liver weighing between 20-30 mg was cut from each liver sample and immediately placed in 800 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4C and at 14,000 X g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to purify DNA and RNA via Qiagens AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). DNA was eluted twice per sample in 50 uL H2O per elution. RNA was eluted twice per sample in 30 uL H2O per elution. Concentration and absorbance ratios for all DNA and RNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer from Thermo Scientific (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was measured using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     Aliquots of each DNA sample were bisulfite-converted with the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold kit (Zymo Research). Sequencing libraries was generated from the converted DNA sample with the EpiGnome Methyl-Seq kit (Epicentre). The resulting libraries were QC-ed by bioanalyzer and quantified by fluorometric Qubic measurements and RT-PCR.     The BS-sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 3000 at UC Davis Genome Center. Each library was sequenced on one HiSeq lane by itself with paired end 100bp reads.",

Using dose-rates between 0.05 Gy/min and 0.17 Gy/min, iron and proton, respectively; 0.15 Gy was delivered using 1 GeV/nucleon iron ions (LET ~151 keV per um) or 0.9 Gy at 1 GeV energy protons (LET ~0.22 keV per um). All mice were handled in accordance with the guidelines set, reviewed, and approved by the International Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) at both GeneSys Research Institute and Brookhaven National Labs.     Primary left ventricular cardiac cells from 8–9 mo old C57BL/6NT mice were isolated using standard preparation protocol that included cannulation of the aorta and collagenase digestion, followed by a Ca2+ gradient selection. This procedure yielded greater than 90% of Ca2+-tolerant cardiomyocytes. The resulting cell suspension could contain a small population of inflammatory and/or endothelial cells.     Cardiac Cell Isolation - Primary left ventricular cardiac cells from 8-9 months old C57Bl/6NT mice were isolated using standard preparation protocol that includes cannulation of the aorta and collagenase digestion followed by a Ca2+ gradient selection (22, 25, 26, 33). This procedure yielded >90% of Ca2+ tolerant cardiomyocytes (CMs). The resulting cell suspension could contain a small population of inflammatory and/or endothelial cells.

          "Study Description": "We examined molecular responses using transcriptome profiling in isolated left ventricular murine cardiomyocytes to 90 cGy, 1 GeV proton (1H) and 15 cGy, 1 GeV/nucleon (n) iron (56Fe) particles 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after exposure. Unsupervised clustering analysis of gene expression segregated samples according to the radiation (IR) response, and time after exposure with 56Fe-IR showing the greatest level of gene modulation. 1H-IR exposures showed little differential transcript modulation. Network analysis categorized the major differentially expressed genes into cell cycle, oxidative responses and transcriptional regulation functional groups. Transcriptional networks identified key nodes regulating expression. Individual transcription factors were inferred to be active at 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after exposure. Validation of the signal transduction network by protein analysis showed that particle IR clearly regulates a long lived signaling mechanism for p38 MAPK signaling and NFATc4 activation. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays supported the role of additional key transcription factors GATA-4, STAT-3 and NF-kB as regulators of the response at specific time points. These data suggest that the molecular response to 56Fe-IR is unique and shows long-lasting gene expression in cardiomyocytes, up to 28 days after exposure. Additionally, proteins involved in signal transduction and transcriptional activation via DNA binding play a role in the response to high charge (Z) and energy (E) particles (HZE). Our study may have implications for NASA's efforts to develop heart disease risk estimates for astronauts safety via identification of specific HZE-IR molecular markers and for patients receiving conventional and particle radiotherapy.

          "Study Description": "We examined molecular responses using transcriptome profiling in isolated left ventricular murine cardiomyocytes to 90 cGy, 1 GeV proton (1H) and 15 cGy, 1 GeV/nucleon (n) proton (56Fe) particles 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after exposure. Unsupervised clustering analysis of gene expression segregated samples according to the radiation (IR) response, and time after exposure with 56Fe-IR showing the greatest level of gene modulation. 1H-IR exposures showed little differential transcript modulation. Network analysis categorized the major differentially expressed genes into cell cycle, oxidative responses and transcriptional regulation functional groups. Transcriptional networks identified key nodes regulating expression. Individual transcription factors were inferred to be active at 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after exposure. Validation of the signal transduction network by protein analysis showed that particle IR clearly regulates a long lived signaling mechanism for p38 MAPK signaling and NFATc4 activation. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays supported the role of additional key transcription factors GATA-4, STAT-3 and NF-kB as regulators of the response at specific time points. These data suggest that the molecular response to 56Fe-IR is unique and shows long-lasting gene expression in cardiomyocytes, up to 28 days after exposure. Additionally, proteins involved in signal transduction and transcriptional activation via DNA binding play a role in the response to high charge (Z) and energy (E) particles (HZE). Our study may have implications for NASA's efforts to develop heart disease risk estimates for astronauts safety via identification of specific HZE-IR molecular markers and for patients receiving conventional and particle radiotherapy.

In comparison to tumors from p53 single heterozygous (p53+/-) mice, we find that tumors from Fbxw7/p53 double heterozygous (Fbxw7+/-p53+/-) mice show significant deregulation of cholesterol metabolic processes independent of rapamycin treatment, while cell cycle related genes were upregulated in tumors from placebo treated Fbxw7+/-p53+/- mice, but not in tumors from rapamycin treated Fbxw7+/-p53+/- mice. On the other hand, tumors from rapamycin treated Fbxw7+/-p53+/- mice were enriched for genes involved in the integrated stress response, an adaptive mechanism to survive in stressful environments. p53+/− and p53+/−Fbxw7+/− mice were generated by crossing p53-/- mice with Fbxw7+/- mice.

Biotinylated cRNA were prepared with the Ambion MessageAmp kit for Illumina arrays     Standard Illumina hybridization protocol     Standard Illumina scanning protocol     The data were corrected with COMBAT correction and then quantile normalisation with GenePattern Illumina Normalizer Module ID_REF = VALUE = COMBAT, Quantile     Murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells, originally derived from a spontaneous tumor in a C57BL/6 mouse, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The LLC cells were cultured under standard conditions in high glucose DMEM (Gibco Invitrogen Cell Culture, Carlsbad, CA) with 10% FBS (Gibco Invitrogen Cell Culture) and 5% CO2.\n\nTumor Injections:\nInjections of C57BL/6 mice were made subcutaneously in the mid-dorsal region of the back with 10^6 LLC cells, 8 h after the first of three dose fractions. Unirradiated mice, serving as controls, were similarly injected with 10^6 LLC cells. Mice were anesthetized by inhalation of 4% isoflurane, for injection of 10^6 LLC cells suspended in 0.2 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Sham mice were treated identically.     Thirty C57BL/6 male mice 68 days old (Jackson Laboratory) and thirty 736 days old (National Institute of Aging) were used in this study, and irradiation protocols of these mice were previously published. Ten adolescent and ten old mice were given whole-body irradiation once a day for three days with 0.5 Gy of proton ions (1-GeV; LET 0.24-keV/µm; plateau, non-Bragg peak, region, 0.5 Gy/min dose rate) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) (Upton, NY). Mice were restrained and were not anesthetized during irradiation. An additional 20 adolescent and 20 old mice were not irradiated, but otherwise handled identically and used as sham, unirradiated controls. All animals, control and irradiated, were injected with syngeneic LLC cells after the first of three fractions of sham or proton irradiation. The timing of the dosing relative to cancer cell injection was chosen in order to maximize the likelihood of the impact of proton irradiation on tumor development and advancement. This was achieved by combining the situation where the first irradiation fraction acts on the normal cells of the host and later fractions modulate interactions between the host and the cancer cells.     Mice were monitored regularly, and tumor size was measured with calipers by a single individual. Once tumors reached ∼1.5 cm^3 , mice were sacrificed with a 0.6-ml intraperitoneal injection of 2,2,2-tribromoethanol at 20 mg/ml. Tissues to be frozen-sectioned were dissected and slow-frozen in OCT (Tissue Tek, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) in the gas phase of liquid nitrogen, and tissues for RNA isolation were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.",

          "Study Description": "Age plays a crucial role in the interplay between tumor and host; with further perturbations induced by irradiation. Proton irradiation on tumors induces biological modulations including inhibition of angiogenic and immune factors critical to ''hallmark'' processes impacting tumor development, in addition to physical targeting advantages. These advantages have provided promising results for proton therapy in cancer. Additionally, protons have implications for carcinogenesis risk of space travel (due to the high proportion of high energy protons in space radiation). Through a systems biology approach, we investigated how host tissue (i.e. splenic tissue) of tumor-bearing mice is altered with age, with or without whole-body proton exposure. Transcriptome analysis was performed on splenic tissue from adolescent (68 day) versus old (736 day) C57BL/6 male mice injected with Lewis lung carcinoma cells with or without three fractionations of 0.5Gy (1GeV) proton irradiation. Global transcriptome analysis indicated that proton irradiation of adolescent hosts caused significant signaling changes within splenic tissues that support carcinogenesis within the mice, as compared to old subjects. Increases in cell cycling and immunosuppression in irradiated adolescent hosts with CDK2, MCM7, CD74, and RUVBL2 as the key players were involved in the regulatory changes in host environment response (i.e. spleen). These results suggest a significant biological component to proton irradiation, operative through host age, that would indicate a modulation of host's ability to support carcinogenesis in adolescence and the bestowal of resistance to immunosuppression, carcinogenesis, and genetic perturbation by old age.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "50,000 4T1 tumor cells were injected to the right flank of a Balb/C mice     4T1 model: mice were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) in the right flank with 5×10^4 4T1 cells on day 0. TSA model: mice were injected s.c with 1×105 TSA cells in the right flank (primary tumor) on day 0, and in the left flank (secondary tumor) on day 2. Perpendicular tumor diameters were measured with a Vernier caliper, and tumor volumes calculated as length × width2 × 0.52. On day 12, when tumors reached 60-80 mm3, mice were randomly assigned to treatment groups. RT was delivered to the tumor volume as previously described with some modifications. Briefly, all mice (including mice receiving sham radiation) were anesthetized by intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection of avertin (240 mg/kg) and the primary tumors irradiated with 6 Gy on days 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 using the Small Animal Radiation Research Platform (SARRP Xstrahl Ltd, Surrey, UK). 13C4 and 1D11 mAbs were administered i.p. (200μg/mouse) every other day from day 12 to day 28. In some experiments, anti-PD-1 mAb RMP1-14 was injected i.p. (200μg/mouse) on days 18, 22, 26 and 30.\n\nReferenced Methods:\nAll mice were briefly anesthetized by i.p. injection of Avertin (240 mg/kg). Mice assigned to radiation were positioned on a dedicated plexiglass tray and the whole body was protected by lead shielding, except for the area of the tumor to be irradiated. RT was delivered to a field including the tumor with 5 mm margins using a 60CO radiation source by one fraction of 12 Gy. Control hamster IgG and 9H10 were given i.p. at 200 μg at 1, 4, and 7 days after RT. In a second set of experiments, RT was delivered by two fractions of 12 Gy given at 48 hours interval, and the treatment groups did not include 9H10 mAb alone. Tumor growth was evaluated every 2 to 3 days until death or sacrifice when mice seemed moribund. At death, presence of metastases in the lungs was confirmed by macroscopic and microscopic evaluation on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung sections stained with H and E using standard procedures. In some experiments, all mice were sacrificed at day 32 or 35 post-tumor inoculation, and metastatic nodules in the lungs were counted after formalin fixation using a dissecting microscope.\n\nCobalt-60 produces gamma rays with energies of 1.173 and 1.332 MeV and has a half-life of 5.27 years. Ionizing radiation energy values were added by GeneLab.     4T1-tumor bearing mice received i.p. injections of 1D11, a pan-isoform neutralizing TGFbeta monoclonal antobody (mAb) or its isotype control starting at day 12 post-tumor cells injection. In half of the mice of each group, tumors were treated with local RT given in 5 fractions of 6Gy starting on day 13. On day 22, tumors were harvested and kept in RNAlater at -80C until RNA extraction.     RNA was extracted and purified with Qiagen Rneasy Mini kit as described by the manufacturer.     Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).     Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip mouse genome 430.2 array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.     GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.5 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.5/Microarray/Affymetrix/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAffymetrix). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.4).

          "Managing NASA Center": "",
          "Study Description": "Accumulating data support the concept that ionizing radiation therapy (RT) has the potential to convert the tumor into an in situ, individualized vaccine; however this potential is rarely realized by RT alone. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is an immunosuppressive cytokine that is activated by RT and inhibits the antigen-presenting function of dendritic cells and the differentiation of effector CD8+ T cells. Here we tested the hypothesis that TGFβ hinders the ability of RT to promote anti-tumor immunity. Development of tumor-specific immunity was examined in a pre-clinical model of metastatic breast cancer. Mice bearing established 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma treated with pan-isoform specific TGFβ neutralizing antibody, 1D11, showed significantly improved control of the irradiated tumor and non-irradiated metastases, but no effect in the absence of RT. Notably, whole tumor transcriptional analysis demonstrated the selective upregulation of genes associated with immune-mediated rejection only in tumors of mice treated with RT+TGFβ blockade. Mice treated with RT+TGFβ blockade exhibited cross-priming of CD8+ T cells producing IFNγ in response to three tumor-specific antigens in tumor-draining lymph nodes, which was not evident for single modality treatment. Analysis of the immune infiltrate in mouse tumors showed a significant increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells only in mice treated with the combination of RT+TGFβ blockade. Depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells abrogated the therapeutic benefit of RT+TGFβ blockade. These data identify TGFβ as a master inhibitor of the ability of RT to generate an in situ tumor vaccine, which supports testing inhibition of TGFβ during radiotherapy to promote therapeutically effective anti-tumor immunity. We used genome-wide microarray to depict main biological processes responsibles for the therapeutic benefit of the combination ofTGF-beta blockade and local radiotherapy. To gain a more comprehensice protrait of the effects of RT and TGFbeta blockade on gene expressionin tumors, we collected 4T1 tumors 4 days after completion of RT. Three tumors from each group were then subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on affymetrix array.",

MLO-Y4 cells were digested by trypsin containing 0.03% EDTA, and seeded onto 96-well plates with a density of 30000 per well, then ten wells were placed into a 35-mm tissue-culture plate. Then the plate was delivered to the bore of the superconducting magnet with three different apparent gravity levels  (ug,1-g and 2-g). Superconducting magnet with LG-HMF was manufactured by Japan Superconductor Technology, Inc. (JASTEC) according to the specific specifications proposed by authors. These three plates were fixed on an object holder, and continuously 37C and 5%CO2 were supplied to the magnet bore. Control group was incubated at 37C and 5%CO2 under normal earth gravity condition.     MLO-Y4 osteocyte-like cell were cultured in alpha-Modified Eagle's Medium (alpha-MEM) containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% calf serum, 1% benzylpenicillin and 1% streptomycin. MLO-Y4 cells grew on culture flask coated with collagen (rat tail collagen type1, 0.15mg/ml) and cells were incubated at 37C with 5% CO2 before treated under LG-HMF.     Total RNA was extracted by using Trizol reagent (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, US) with the standard operating steps given by the manufacturer. The integrity of RNA samples were checked by an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US), which performed as a RIN number.     RNA was amplified, labeled and purified by using Ambion WT expression Kit (Amnion,US) and GeneChip WT Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, US) following the manufactuers instructions to obtain biotin labeled cDNA.

          "Study Description": "The diamagnetic levitation as a novel ground-based model for simulating a reduced gravity environment has recently been applied in life science research. In this study a specially designed superconducting magnet with a large gradient high magnetic field (LG-HMF), which can provide three apparent gravity levels (μ-g, 1-g, and 2-g), was used to simulate a space-like gravity environment. Osteocyte, as the most important mechanosensor in bone, takes a pivotal position in mediating the mechano-induced bone remodeling. In this study, the effects of LG-HMF on gene expression profiling of osteocyte-like cell line MLO-Y4 were investigated by Affymetrix DNA microarray. LG-HMF affected osteocyte gene expression profiling. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and data mining were further analyzed by using bioinfomatic tools, such as DAVID, iReport. 12 energy metabolism related genes (PFKL, AK4, ALDOC, COX7A1, STC1, ADM, CA9, CA12, P4HA1, APLN, GPR35 and GPR84) were further confirmed by real-time PCR. An integrated gene interaction network of 12 DEGs was constructed. Bio-data mining showed that genes involved in glucose metabolic process and apoptosis changed notablly. Our results demostrated that LG-HMF affected the expression of energy metabolism related genes in osteocyte. The identification of sensitive genes to special environments may provide some potential targets for preventing and treating bone loss or osteoporosis.",

          "Study Description": "Densely ionizing radiation is a major component of the space radiation environment and has potentially greater carcinogenic effect compared to sparsely ionizing radiation that is prevalent in the terrestrial environment. It is unknown to what extent the irradiated microenvironment contributes to the differential carcinogenic potential of densely ionizing radiation. To address this gap, 10-week old BALB/c mice were irradiated with 100 cGy sparsely ionizing g-radiation or 10, 30, or 80 cGy of densely ionizing, 350 MeV/amu Si particles and transplanted 3 days later with syngeneic Trp53 null mammary fragments. Tumor appearance was monitored for 600 days. Tumors arising in Si-particle irradiated mice had a shorter median time to appearance, grew faster and were more likely to metastasize. Most tumors arising in sham-irradiated mice were ER-positive, pseudo-glandular and contained both basal keratin 14 and luminal keratin 8/18 cells (designated K14/18), while most tumors arising in irradiated hosts were K8/18 positive (designated K18) and ER negative. Comparison of K18 vs K14/18 tumor expression profiles showed that genes increased in K18 tumors were associated with ERBB2 and KRAS while decreased genes overlapped with those down regulated in metastasis and by loss of E-cadherin. Consistent with this, K18 tumors grew faster than K14/18 tumors and more mice with K18 tumors developed lung metastases compared to mice with K14/18 tumors. However, K18 tumors arising in Si-particle irradiated mice grew even faster and were more metastatic compared to control mice. A K18 Si-irradiated host profile was enriched in genes involved in mammary stem cells, stroma, and Notch signaling. Thus systemic responses to densely ionizing radiation enriches for a ER-negative, K18-positive tumor, whose biology is more aggressive compared to similar tumors arising in non-irradiated hosts. Key Words: ionizing radiation; breast cancer; heavy ion radiation;initiation; promotion 3 different dose of Si were used. Total RNA was extracted from mammary tumors derived from transplantations of non-irradiated p53null mammary fragments into irradiated hosts. We analyzed a total of 45 Trp53-null tumors: 18 from sham-irradiated hosts, 9 from 10 cGy Si-irradiated hosts, 10 from 30 cGy Si-irradiated hosts, and 8 from irradiated hosts.",

When ingested or inhaled, it can expose the entire body for an extended period of time, potentially contributing to serious health consequences ranging from acute radiation syndrome to increased cancer risks. In order to identify changes in gene expression that may be informative for detecting such exposure, and to begin examining the molecular responses involved, we have profiled global gene expression in mice injected with 137CsCl. We extracted RNA from the blood of control or 137CsCl-injected mice at 2, 3, 5, 20 or 30 days after exposure. Gene expression was measured using Agilent Whole Mouse Genome Microarrays, and the data was analyzed using BRB-ArrayTools. Three-month old male C57Bl/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with 8.0 ± 0.3 MBq 137CsCl solution in a volume of 50 μL, or left as controls. Groups of treated and control mice were sacrificed at intervals during the first 2-30 days after exposure, and total blood was collected using cardiac puncture.

          "Study Protocol Description": "Eight-week-old female inbred C3H/He Slc, C57BL/6J Jms Slc, and A/J Jms Slc mice were purchased from Japan SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the National Institute of Radiological Sciences Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol no. 07-2014-1).     Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal injection), and the whole thorax was locally irradiated with 10 Gy of 290 MeV/n C-ion beams generated by the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) at the center of a 6-cm spread-out Bragg peak. The beams penetrated from the chest to the back, with the dose prescribed to the mid-plane of the mouse, which corresponded to a depth of 7 mm, assuming that the mouse had a homogeneous density equivalent to water. In control mice, the whole thorax was irradiated with 137Cs γ-rays in the same way. For the survival study, 10 mice were irradiated with 10 Gy or 12.5 Gy (C3H/He and A/J only) of C-ions, or with 10 Gy, 15 Gy, or 20 Gy of γ-rays, and they were observed over a period of 180 days after irradiation.\n\nCesium-137 produces gamma rays with an energy of 0.662 MeV and has a half-life of 30.1 years. Ionizing radiation energy values were added by GeneLab.     Both lungs were removed from three mice of each strain at 12 hours, 3 days, 5 days, 7 days, 56 days, 84 days, and 168 days after irradiation, and the wet weight was measured immediately. The lungs were completely dried in an incubator at 65°C for 24 hours for dry weight measurement. As an indication of lung edema, the ratio of lung weights (wet/dry) was determined.\nFor the other analyses, 10 mice of each strain were sacrificed at 6 hours, 14 days, 28 days, 56 days, 84 days, and 168 days after irradiation. Nonirradiated control samples were extracted at the same time. The right lobes of the lungs were placed in RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX) and stored at −20°C for gene expression analysis. The left lungs were fixed for 24 h in 10% neutralized formalin.     ISOGEN (NIPPON GENE) + RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN)     Agilent Quick Amp Labeling Kit     Cy3-labeled cRNA was synthesized using Agilent Low RNA Input Linear Amplification Kit PLUS, single color (Cyamine 3-CTP).     according to standard Agilent protocol     Scanned on an Agilent G2565BA scanner. Images were quantified using Agilent Feature Extraction Software (version 9.5).     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7112 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Agilent_1-channel/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7112_Versions/GL-DPPD-7112.md), using NF_MAAgilent1ch version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAgilent1ch_1.0.4/Microarray/Agilent_1-channel/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAgilent1ch). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.1). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3). Raw data quality assurance density, pseudo image, MA, and foreground-background plots were generated using limma (version 3.50.3), and boxplots were generated using ggplot2 (version 3.4.0). The raw intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the limma (version 3.50.3) quantile method. Normalized data quality assurance density, pseudo image, and MA plots were generated using limma (version 3.50.3), and boxplots were generated using ggplot2 (version 3.4.0).

          "Study Description": "The aim of our research is to clarify the mechanisms generating heterogeneity in response to C-ion irradiation that arise from individual genetic variations in humans. In this study, we performed whole lung C-ion irradiation using three different strains of mice to examine whether strain-dependent differences in radiation effects occur in high-LET C-ion thoracic irradiation. Murine strain-variance was evaluated by histopathological examination of intra-alveolar hemorrhage that is likely to occur during the early phase after irradiation, and of lung fibrosis during the late phase, occurring more than three months after irradiation. We also performed microarray analysis to identify the key genes that are differentially regulated in different mouse strains after C-ion irradiation and to determine the mechanism of strain-dependent pulmonary damage after high-LET C-ion irradiation. Eight-week old female inbred C3H/He Slc, C57BL/6J Jms Slc and A/J Jms Slc mice (3 kinds of mice) were used. The whole thorax of three mice was locally irradiated at 10 Gy with C-ion beams, with a reference beam, 137Cs gamma-rays (2 kinds of beam). Three mice of each strain (3 mice) were sacrificed, and immediately dissected for lung extraction at 6 h (6h sample). Lungs for three mice of each strain without irradiation were extracted at the same time as control samples (control sample). Hybridization to microarrays (Whole Mouse Genome 4x44K OligoMicroarray Kit, single color, Cyamine 3-CTP) consisting of 44,000 total spots was conducted using an Agilent Gene Expression hybridization kit. The arrays from three independent replicates for each sample (3 arrays) were scanned on an Agilent dual-laser Microarray Scanner (all from Agilent Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 108 samples were analyzed. 3 replicate arrays x 3 mice x 3 strains x 2 timing for sampling x 2 kinds of beam.",

          "Managing NASA Center": "",
          "Study Description": "Proton irradiation is touted for its improved tumor targeting due to the physical advantages of ion beams for radiotherapy. Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that in addition to targeting advantages proton irradiation can inhibit angiogenic and immune factors and thereby modulate tumor progression. High-energy protons also constitute a principal component of the galactic cosmic rays to which astronauts are exposed. Increased understanding of the biological effects of proton exposure would thus contribute to both improved cancer therapy and carcinogenesis risk assessment for space travel. In addition age plays a major role in tumor incidence and is a critical consideration for estimating cancer risk. We investigated the effects of host age and proton exposure on tumor progression. Tumor lag time and growth dynamics were tracked following injection of murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells into young (68 day) versus old (736 day) mice with or without coincident irradiation. Tumor progression was suppressed in old compared to young mice. Differences in progression were further modulated by proton irradiation (1GeV) with increased inhibition evident in old mice. Through global transcriptome analysis TGFB1 and TGFB2 were determined to be key players that contributed to the tumor dynamics observed. These findings point to older hosts providing decreased systemic tumor support which can be further inhibited by proton irradiation. Overall design: For genome-wide expression profiling of tumor tissue Mouse WG-6 BeadArray chips (Illumina San Diego CA) were used. Total RNA was amplified with the Ambion Illumina TotalPrep Amplification Kit (Ambion Austin TX) and labeled from all replicate biological samples for each condition. For tumor replicates thirty tumor samples from adolescent and thirty tumor samples from old mice for a total of 60 tumor samples were used. All replicate samples were run individually. For each age group ten tumor samples had received proton irradiation while twenty tumor samples were from unirradiated mice (as described above). Total RNA was isolated and purified using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and quantified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Samples were deemed suitable for amplification and hybridization if they had 28s/18s = 2:1 RIN >7. Total RNA of 500ng per sample was amplified using AmbionTotalPrep and 1.5ug of the product was loaded onto the chips. Following hybridization at 55C the chips were washed and then scanned using the Illumina iScan System. The data was checked with GenomeStudio (Illumina) for quality control. In GenomeStudio data was background subtracted and rank invariant normalization was applied. Data was imported into MultiExperiment Viewer MeV for statistical analysis. The statistically significant genes were determined using MeV by applying a one-way ANOVA analysis with standard Bonferroni correction with a FDR <0.05 that resulted in a list of significant genes. Average gene expression signals <10 were filtered out due to signal being",

          "Study Protocol Description": "3 week old BALB/cJ female mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and housed in the Berg Animal Facility at NYUMC. After acclimation, mice were cleared of the inguinal mammary gland on one side while the contra lateral inguinal mammary gland was kept intact. The mice were allowed to recover and aged 6 additional weeks at the Berg Animal Facility at NYUMC. Mice were given food and water ad libitum. At 9 weeks of age, all mice were transported by courier to the Brookhaven National Lab Animal Facility. After acclimation for one week, mice were irradiated or sham irradiated at 10 weeks of age. Tissues are harvested 1 week, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks post IR. The 4 and 12 week time points are collected after the mice are transported back to NYUMC. This data submission is for the mammary tissue that was kept intact. All procedures were done under protocols reviewed and approved by both IACUC committees at NYUMC and Brookhaven National Laboratories.     Mice were either irradiated or not with high-LET silicon particles (350MeV/amu) or low-LET gamma-radiation.\n\nMammary tissue irradiated at 10 weeks of age with either 100 cGy sparsely ionizing gamma-rays, or 10 cGy or 30 cGy densely ionizing radiation (350 MeV/amu Si). Mammary tissue was collected 1 weeks, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks post-irradiation. Four radiation treatment groups: sham, 100 cGy sparsely ionizing gamma-rays, 10 cGy or 30 cGy densely ionizing radiation (350 MeV/amu Si). Three time points post-irradiation (1, 4, and 12 weeks). Three or four replicates per time point.     Total RNA was extracted using Rneasy kit from Oiagen, according to manufacturer's instructions     250 ng of total RNA is first amplified into cRNA and then made into cDNA using the Ambion WT Expression Kit. 5.5 ug of the cDNA is then fragmented using the Affymetrix GeneChip WT Terminal Labeling kit. Fragmentation is confirmed by running each sample on the Agilent Bioanalyzer using the RNA 6000 kit. The fragmented cDNA is then labeled using the Affymetrix GeneChip WT Terminal Labeling kit.     The labeled cDNA is added to the hybridization cocktail that is prepared according to the protocol included in the Affymetrix GeneTitan Hybridization Wash, and Stain kit. The samples are then put onto a hybridization tray and loaded into the Affymetrix GeneTitan MC for hybridization, washing, and scanning. The samples are hybridized for 60 degrees C for 16 hours once all plates are loaded.     Arrays are scanned in the Affymetrix GeneTitan MC using a xenon light bulb and the image is captured using a camera.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.5 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.5/Microarray/Affymetrix/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAffymetrix). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.4). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using oligo (version 1.58.0). Raw data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). The raw probe level intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the oligo (version 1.58.0) quantile method. Normalized probe level data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). Normalized probe level data was summarized to the probeset level using the oligo (version 1.58.0) RMA method. Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probeset using biomaRt (version 2.50.0), Ensembl database (ensembl.org, release 107). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probeset to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned for every probeset that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "RNA was isolated from mouse tumor tissue. Tumor chunks of 1 to 2mm in diameter were placed in TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and homogenized using a Tissue Lyser II (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Tissue with TRIzol was centrifuged at 1200g and 0.2ml of chloroform was added for 5min. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000g for 15min at 4C. The aqueous phase with RNA was transferred to a 1.5ml eppendorf tube. Isopropyl alcohol (0.5ml) was added to each sample (room temperature) for 10min and samples were centrifuged at 10,000g for 10min at 4C. RNA pellets were washed once with 75% ethanol and resuspended in 100l RNase-free water. Quality and quantity of RNA were measured by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA).     Total RNA of 500ng per sample was amplified using Ambion TotalPrep (Ambion), and 1.5g of the product was loaded onto the chips.     Following hybridization at 55C, the chips were washed.     The data was checked with GenomeStudio (Illumina) for quality control. In GenomeStudio, data was background subtracted and rank invariant normalization was applied.     Standard Illumina scanning protocol using Illumina iScan.     Twenty C57BL/6 male mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), having an average lifespan of 878 days (36) were obtained at age 130 days, and another 20 mice were obtained at age 540 days from the National Institute on Aging Rodent Colony before transport to Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL, Upton, NY). The scaling of mouse age to human age was based on published criteria (37). Age comparisons are as follows: mice 143 and 551 days at tumor injection are considered equivalent to 23- and 58-year-old humans. Ten young and 10 middle-aged mice were irradiated for five consecutive days with 0.2 Gy of 56Fe ions (1 GeV/amu) with an LET of 151 keV/lm at BNL. The mice were given whole-body irradiation with the body axis oriented perpendicular to the beam. An additional 10 young and 10 middle-aged mice were not irradiated, but otherwise handled identically and used as sham, unirradiated controls. In this study, all animals were injected with tumor cells, as described below.     Murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells, a line originally derived from a spontaneous tumor in a C57BL/6 mouse, were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The LLC cells were cultured under standard conditions in DMEM with high glucose (Gibco Invitrogen Cell Culture, Carlsbad, CA) and 10% FBS (Gibco Invitrogen Cell Culture) and 5% CO2. The measured doubling time for LLC cells was 0.8 days\n\nTumor Injections\nC57BL/6 mice were injected subcutaneously in the mid-dorsal region of the back with 1 x 10^6 LLC cells 8 h after the first irradiation fraction, along with injections of unirradiated control mice.\nMice were prepared for injections by shaving the caudal half of the back and were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane before subcutaneous cell injection of 10^6 LLC cells suspended in 0.2 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Control, sham-irradiated, mice were otherwise treated identically.     Mice were monitored regularly and tumor size was measured with calipers. Once tumors reached approximately 1.5 cm3, mice were euthanized and the tissues were processed. LLC tumor histology was confirmed.",

          "Managing NASA Center": "",
          "Study Description": "Age plays a major role in tumor incidence and is an important consideration when modeling the carcinogenesis process or estimating cancer risks. Epidemiological data show that from adolescence through middle age, cancer incidence increases with age. This effect is commonly attributed to a lifetime accumulation of cellular, particularly DNA, damage. However, during middle-age, the incidence begins to decelerate and, for many tumor sites, it actually decreases at sufficiently advanced ages. We investigated if the observed deceleration and potential decrease in incidence could be attributed to a decreased capacity of older hosts to support tumor progression, and whether HZE (high atomic number (Z), high energy (E)) radiation differentially modulates tumor progression in young versus middle-age hosts, issues relevant to estimating carcinogenesis risk for astronauts. Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells were injected into syngeneic mice (143 and 551 days old), which were then subject to whole-body 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu). Three findings emerged: 1) among unirradiated animals, substantial inhibition of tumor progression and significantly decreased tumor growth rates were seen for middle-aged mice compared to young mice; 2) whole-body 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) inhibited tumor progression in both young and in middle-aged mice (with greater suppression seen in case of young animals), with little effect on tumor growth rates; and 3) 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) suppressed tumor progression in young mice, to a degree not significantly different than transiting from young to middle-aged. Thus, 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) acted similar to aging with respect to tumor progression. We further investigated the molecular underpinnings driving the radiation modulation of tumor dynamics in young and middle-aged mice. Through global gene expression analysis, the key players, FASN, AKT1, and the CXCL12/CXCR4 complex, were determined to be contributory. In sum, these findings demonstrate a reduced capacity of middle-aged hosts to support the progression phase of carcinogenesis and identify molecular factors contributory to HZE radiation modulation of tumor progression as a function of age. For genome-wide expression profiling of tumor tissue, Mouse WG-6 BeadArray chips (Illumina, San Diego, CA) were used. Total RNA was amplified with the Ambion Illumina TotalPrep Amplification Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and labeled from all replicate biological samples for each condition. The number of tumor sample replicates used from each condition is as follows: 10 samples from young unirradiated mice, 8 samples from young irradiated mice, 7 samples from middle-aged unirradiated mice, 5 samples from middle-aged irradiated mice. Total RNA was isolated and purified using Trizol (Invitrogen) or RNeasy (Qiagen), quantified and qualified using Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and samples were deemed suitable for amplification and hybridization if they had O.D. 260/280 = 1.7 - 2.1, 28s/18s = 2:1, RIN (RNA integrity number) >7. Total RNA of 500ng per sample was amplified using Ambion TotalPrep (Ambion), and 1.5ug of the product was loaded onto the chips. Following hybridization at 55C, the chips were washed and then scanned using the Illumina iScan (Illumina), and the data were analyzed using GenomeStudio (Illumina). Data were first analyzed for gene expression and then culled for present genes (genes that meet the criteria of detection p-value < 0.05). Expression above background was included in an expressed genes working data set for further analyses. Rank variant normalization was applied to the data before extensive analysis. Differential gene expression analysis was used to compare to the reference group, young unirradiated mice, and genes were then evaluated and validated.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Total RNA was extracted using Trizol Reaget (Invitrogen), according to manufacturer's instructions.     100 ng of total RNA were used to prepare cRNA following the Affymetrix 3 IVT Express Kit labeling protocol     12.5 micrograms of fragmented cRNA was hybridized for 16 hr to the Affymetrix MG 430 2.0 arrays using GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 and Genechip fluidics station FS 450, following standard Affymetrix protocols.     Affymetrix GeneArray scanner 7G was used to collect images     Feature intensity was extracted by Affymetrix GeneChip Operating System as CEL files. The probe-level analysis of the CEL files was performed by the RMA algorithm using Agilent GeneSpring GX10 program. No further adjustments were made to the data in the table. ID_REF equals VALUE equals RMA normalized probe intensity, no further adjustments were made     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.5 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.5/Microarray/Affymetrix/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAffymetrix). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.4). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using oligo (version 1.58.0). Raw data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). The raw probe level intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the oligo (version 1.58.0) quantile method. Normalized probe level data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). Normalized probe level data was summarized to the probeset level using the oligo (version 1.58.0) RMA method. Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probeset using biomaRt (version 2.50.0), Ensembl database (ensembl.org, release 107). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probeset to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned for every probeset that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).     All animal experiments were performed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory with institutional review and approval. BALB/c mice were purchased from Simonsen Laboratories (Gilroy, CA) and housed four per cage, fed with Lab Diet 5008 chow and water ad libidum. Trp53 null and Tgfb1 heterozygote BALB/c mice were bred in-house under similar conditions. For transplantation experiments, the epithelial rudiments in inguinal glands of 3-week-old mice were surgically removed.     These host mice were irradiated whole body at 10–12 weeks of age to the indicated dose at a rate of 23 cGy/min using 60Co gamma-radiation. Three days after irradiation, the cleared mammary glands of host mice were transplanted with a 1 mm^3 fragment of non-irradiated Trp53 null BALB/c mammary gland harvested and pooled from 3 or more inguinal glands of 8–10 week old donor mice. Mice were monitored for 365 days. Cobalt-60 produces gamma rays with energies of 1.173 and 1.332 MeV and has a half-life of 5.27 years. Ionizing radiation energy values were added by GeneLab.     p53null tumors developed from p53null mammary fragments that were orthotoically transplanted into the inguinal mammary fat pads of female host mice that had their endogenous epithelium removed at 3wks of age.",

          "Study Description": "We developed a mouse model that captures radiation effects on host biology by transplanting unirradiated Trp53 null mammary tissue to sham or irradiated hosts. Gene expression profiles of tumors that arose in irradiated mice are distinct from those that arose in naive hosts. Host irradiation induces a metaprofile consisting of gene modules representing stem cells, cell motility, macrophages and autophagy. Human orthologs of the host irradiation metaprofile discriminated between radiation-preceded and sporadic human thyroid cancers. An irradiated host centroid was strongly associated with estrogen receptor negative breast cancer. When applied to sporadic human breast cancers, the irradiated host metaprofile strongly associated with basal-like and claudin-low breast cancer intrinsic subtypes. Comparing host irradiation in the context of TGFB levels showed that inflammation was robustly associated with claudin-low tumors. The association of the irradiated host metaprofiles with estrogen receptor negative status and claudin-low subtype suggests that host processes similar to those induced by radiation underlie sporadic cancers. Total RNA was extracted from mammary tumors derived from transplantations of non-irradiated p53null mammary fragments into irradiated hosts. We analyized a total of 32 p53null tumors from irradiated wild type mice: 9 from sham-irradiated hosts, and 23 from irradiated hosts. We also analyzed 24 tumors from irradiated TGFb1 heterozygote hosts: 6 from sham-irradiated hosts, and 18 from irradiated hosts.",

Mice were euthanized 6 hours post exposure and blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture.     Cy3-labeled cRNA was generated from 400 ng total RNA using Agilent’s QuickAMP kit.     Cy3-labeled cRNA (1.65 μg) was hybridized to Agilent’s Mouse Whole Genome arrays (G4122F) with Agilent’s GEx Hybridization HI-RPM Buffer. The samples were hybridized for 16 hours in a rotisserie hybridization oven (G2545A, Agilent),     Image analysis and intra-chip normalization were performed with Feature Extraction 9.5.3.1 (Agilent). Unless otherwise noted, subsequent analyses were performed with the R statistical analysis framework (Team, 2010) and associated packages (Reimers and Carey, 2006). Probes that had intensity readings of at least 50 counts (as assessed by Feature Extraction) in over 20% of the test samples (for at least one dose) and 20% of the control samples were retained for analysis. To account for inter-chip variation, quantile normalization was performed on the retained probes using the R bioconductor limma package (Reimers and Carey, 2006).     The arrays were washed with Agilent’s gene expression wash buffers and scanned with an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner 2505A in an ozone hood.     Bioconductor limma quantile normalized signals     Male C57BL/6N mice, ages 8-12 wks old, were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, Inc. (Wilmington, MA). Mice were housed at Georgetown University under standard 12 hr light and 12 hr dark cycle conditions and given water and regular rodent chow ad libitum. All experimental procedures and animal handling were in accordance with animal protocols approved by the Georgetown University Animal Care and Use Committee.     RNA was purified using PreAnalytiX’s PAXgene blood RNA system (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or Ambion’s Mouse RiboPure-Blood RNA isolation kit (Applied Biosystems, Carslbad, CA).

          "Study Description": "Microgravity leads to a 10-15% loss of bone mass in astronauts during space flight. Osteoclast is the multinucleated bone resorbing cell. In this study, we used NASA developed ground based Rotary Wall Vessel Bioreactor (RWV), Rotary Cell Culture System (RCCS) to simulate microgravity (uXg) conditions and demonstrated a significant increase (2-fold) in osteoclastogenesis compared to ground based control (Xg) mouse bone marrow cultures. We further determined the gene expression profiling of RAW 264.7 osteoclast progenitor cells in microgravity by agilent microarray analysis. Gene expression pattern was functional group clustered by transcriptome analysis using gene ontology tree machine (GOTM) for cell proliferation/survival, differentiation and function. We confirm the microgravity modulated gene expression critical for osteoclast differentiation by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis in murine bone marrow cultures. We identify transcription factors such as c-Jun, c-Fos, PU-1 critical for osteoclast differentiation is up-regulated in microgravity conditions. In addition, microgravity resulted in 2.3 and 2.0-fold increase in the level of cathepsin K and MMP-9 matrix metalloproteinase expression in preosteoclast cells involved in the bone resorption process respectively. We also demonstrate a significant increase in the expression levels of M-CSF receptor, c-Fms and PLCy2 and S100A8 molecules that play an important role in Ca2+ signaling essential for osteoclast function. Further, microgravity stimulated preosteoclast cells showed elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels compared to ground based control cells. Thus, microgravity regulated gene expression profiling in preosteoclast cells provide new insights in to molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of osteoclast differentiation/activation responsible for bone loss and fracture risk in astronauts during space flight mission. Microgravity associated with space flight is a challenge for normal bone homeostasis. Astronauts experience 10-15% bone loss during a space flight mission. We aimed to determine the effect of simulated microgravity on osteoclast preosteoclasts cells. RAW264.7 cells (1.5 x 106 /ml) were loaded in RCCS with DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h. The cells were stimulated with RANKL (80ng/ml) for 24 h to obtain preosteoclasts in parallel with ground based control cells. Total RNA was isolated using RNAzol reagent (Biotecx Labs, Houston, TX) from control (Xg) and microgravity (uXg) subjected cells and hybridized with Agilent whole mouse genome 4x44K array system. Slides were washed and scanned on an Agilent G2565 microarray scanner. Data obtained were analyzed with Agilent feature extraction and GeneSpring GX v7.3.1 software packages (Genus biosystem, Inc.

          "Study Protocol Description": "Mice were maintained on a reversed 12:12-h light-dark cycle with controlled temperature (21± 1°C) and humidity. Food and water were provided ad libitum. At 1 wk after arrival, the animals were separated into individual cages for a 3-day acclimation period then were randomly assigned to either of two experimental groups: freely ambulating controls and hindlimb-unloaded animals.     Hindlimb muscles were unloaded using methods described previously (Matuszczak, Arbogast, Reid 2004). Briefly, Elastoplast tape (Beiersdorf-Jobst, Rutherford College, NC) was used to wrap the tail of each animal. A metal clip on the tape was attached to a nylon monofilament line via a stainless steel swivel. The distal end of the nylon line was attached to an overhead support and shortened to suspend the animal in a 45° head-down tilt position. The swivel enabled the animal to explore the cage (360-degree range of motion) and obtain food and water freely. Animals were observed daily for changes in appearance and activity. Each animal was weighed and the angle of hindlimb suspension was adjusted if necessary.     Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy kit Qiagen. The integrity of the RNA was confirmed with analysis by the Agilent 2100 bioanalyser using the RNA 6000 LabChip kit.     600 ng RNA and 3 ul Agilent One-Color RNA Spike-In RNA were labelled with the Agilent Low RNA Input Linear Amplification Kit PLUS, One-Color according to Manufacture's instructions as follows: 1.2 ul T7 Promoter Primer was added to 600 ng RNA and 3 ul spike in control and denatured at 65 C. First Strand Buffer, DTT, dNTP MMLV and RNaseOut was added. The cDNA was synthesised during the following incubation step (2h at 40 C). After 10 min denaturation at 65 C and the addition of Cy-labelled CTP, Transcription Buffer, DTT, NTP, PEG, RNaseOUT, Inorganic Phosphatase, and T7 RNA Polymerase the synthesis of the fluorescent labelled cRNA was performed during the second incubation step (2 h at 40 C). The labelled cRNA was purified with the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit according to Manufacturer's protocol.     The Agilent Hybridisation Kit (catalogue number 5188-5242) was used in conjunction with Agilent Mouse Oligo Arrays (catalogue number G4122F). 2ug of the labelled sample RNA were used for hybridisation according to the Agilent One-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis Protocol The hybridisation was performed for 17 h at 65 C at 10 rpm. Slides were them washed for 1 min at 22 °C in Wash Solution 1 (catalogue number 5188-5325) and 1 min at 22 C in Wash Solution 2, pre-warmed to 37 °C (catalogue number 5188-5326). Slides were incubated for 30s in Agilent Stabilisation and Drying Solution (catalogue number 5185-5979).     Microarrays were scanned using the Agilent Technologies Scanner G2505B US45102871 (ChipScan software version A.7.0.1), scan region 61 X 21.6mm, scan resolution 5 micron single pass, extended dynamic range selected (XDR Hi 100%; XDR Lo 10%).     After 1 day or 12 days, each animal was deeply anesthetized in the hindlimb-unloaded condition. The animal was removed from the unloading device, the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles were excised with the animal under surgical anesthesia, and the animal was euthanized. Muscle was immediately placed in RNAlater (Ambion, Foster City, CA) for subsequent analyses.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7112 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Agilent_1-channel/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7112_Versions/GL-DPPD-7112.md), using NF_MAAgilent1ch version 1.0.1 (GitHub link coming soon). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.2). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3). Raw data quality assurance density, pseudo image, MA, and foreground-background plots were generated using limma (version 3.50.3), and boxplots were generated using ggplot2 (version 3.4.0). The raw intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the limma (version 3.50.3) quantile method. Normalized data quality assurance density, pseudo image, and MA plots were generated using limma (version 3.50.3), and boxplots were generated using using ggplot2 (version 3.4.0). Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probe using biomaRt (version 2.50.0), Ensembl database (ensembl.org, release 107). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probe to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned for every probe that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "C57Bl6 J adult male mice, aged approximately 5-6 months were used. Animals were randomly divided into two groups: control (CT) and tail-suspended hindlimb-unloaded (HU) groups. Hindlimb suspension was performed as previously described (Desaphy et al. 1998) and was approved by the Animal Use and Care Committee of the University of Bari. Briefly, the animal was placed in a special cage that allowed only the forelimbs to touch the bottom of the cage while the hindlimbs were free and suspended; the animal's body was inclined at about 45 degrees from the horizontal. Control and suspended animals had food and water ad libitum.     At the end of the period of suspension (2 weeks), four CT and four HU mice were sacrificed under deep anesthesia induced by intraperitoneal injection of urethane. All animals were sacrificed within 1 h in the morning to avoid differences in circadian and homeostatic sleep-wake factors. The brains were immediately removed and placed in liquid nitrogen.     TRIzol (Invitrogen, CA)     60 ug of total RNA extracted in TRIzol from each brain was reversed transcribed into labeled cDNAs using fluorescent Cy5/Cy3-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences, NJ)     We used brains of four control (C1, C2, C3, C4) and four tail-suspended hindlimb-unloaded (E1, E2, E3, E4) mice to ensure statistical relevance of the study. 60 ug of total RNA extracted in TRIzol from each brain was reversed transcribed into labeled cDNAs using fluorescent Cy5 or Cy3-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences, NJ). Differently labeled cDNAs obtained from a pair of biological replicas were co-hybridized overnight at 50C with a microscope slide spotted with ~ 27,000 mouse cDNA sequences produced by the Microarray Core Facility of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the multiple yellow design (i.e.: C1C2, C3C4, E1E2, E3E4), described in Iacobas DA, Fan C, Iacobas S et al., Transcriptomic changes in developing kidney exposed to chronic hypoxia.

          "Study Description": "Changes in gravitational force such as that experienced by astronauts during space flight induce a redistribution of fluids from the caudad to the cephalad portion of the body together with an elimination of normal head-to-foot hydrostatic pressure gradients. To assess brain gene profile changes associated with microgravity and fluid shift, a large-scale analysis of mRNA expression levels was performed in the brains of 2 weeks control and hindlimb-unloaded (HU) mice using cDNA microarrays. Although to different extent, all functional categories displayed significantly regulated genes indicating that considerable transcriptomic alterations are induced by HU. Interestingly, the TIC class (transport of small molecules and ions into the cells) had the highest percentage of up-regulated genes, while the most down-regulated genes were those of the JAE class (Cell junction, Adhesion, Extracellular Matrix). TIC genes comprised 16% of those whose expression was altered, including sodium channel, nonvoltage-gated 1 beta (Scnn1b), glutamate receptor (Grin1), voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (Vdac1), calcium channel beta 3 subunit (Cacnb3) and others. The analysis performed by GeneMAPP revealed several altered protein classes and functional pathways such as blood coagulation and immune response, learning and memory, ion channels and cell junction. In particular, data indicate that HU causes an alteration in hemostasis which resolves in a shift toward a more hyper-coagulative state with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. Furthermore, HU treatment seems to impact on key steps of synaptic plasticity and learning processes. We used brains of four control (C1, C2, C3, C4) and four tail-suspended hindlimb-unloaded (E1, E2, E3, E4) mice to ensure statistical relevance of the study. 60 ug of total RNA extracted in TRIzol from each brain was reversed transcribed into labeled cDNAs using fluorescent Cy5 or Cy3-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences, NJ). Differently labeled cDNAs obtained from a pair of biological replicas were co-hybridized overnight at 50C with a microscope slide spotted with ~ 27,000 mouse cDNA sequences produced by the Microarray Core Facility of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the multiple yellow design (i.e.: C1C2, C3C4, E1E2, E3E4), described in Iacobas DA, Fan C, Iacobas S et al., Transcriptomic changes in developing kidney exposed to chronic hypoxia.

          "Study Protocol Description": "2T3 murine osteoblast precursor cells were cultured in MEM alpha‐minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin) in a standard humidified incubator (37C, 5% CO2). For RWV experiments, trypsinized cells were seeded on microcarriers (#P102-1521, Solohill, Ann Arbor, MI), which have polystyrene cores with no extracellular matrix coating. The cells were allowed to grow in low adhesion 100 mm plates (Corning, Inc. #3262) for 3 days to confluency and then were exposed to modeled microgravity using the RWV or static 1 g control.     Rotation of the RWV maintains microbeads attached with 2T3 pre-osteoblasts in a continuous free-fall state, simulating a microgravity environment [Schwarz et al., 1992]. The RWV was rotated at 22 rpm to achieve continuous freefall of the cell-bead aggregates. This RWV system has been shown to be an effective simulator of real microgravity conditions as demonstrated in comparative studies using blood mononuclear cells in space flight missions STS-54 and STS-56 [Pellis et al., 1997]. Cells were exposed to the RWV for 3 days so that the data could be directly compared to data obtained with RPM for the same time period [Pardo et al., 2005].     Following the RWV or static 1 g exposure, cells and beads were washed with cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) two times and lysed in 500 ul of a lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Tris-HCl, and 0.1 mM ZnCl2. The lysate and bead mixture was centrifuged for 3 min at 1,500 rpm to separate the beads from the lysate. The lysate was pipetted out of the mixture and stored at -20C until needed. Total RNA was prepared by using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Briefly, after two cold PBS washes, 500 ul of RLT lysis buffer containing beta-mercaptoethanol was added to the bead and cell mixture to isolate the RNA from the beads and cells. The bead and lysate mixture was centrifuged for 3 min at 1,500 rpm to separate the beads from the RNA, and the RNA was pipetted to the homogenizing column in the RNeasy kit. The RNA was purified with the kit and stored at -80C until needed. The RNA was then sent to Affymetrix microarray core facility at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX) for microarray analysis.     Affymetrix Generic Hybridization     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.5 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.5/Microarray/Affymetrix/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAffymetrix). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.4). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using oligo (version 1.58.0). Raw data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). The raw probe level intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the oligo (version 1.58.0) quantile method. Normalized probe level data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). Normalized probe level data was summarized to the probeset level using the oligo (version 1.58.0) RMA method. Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probeset using biomaRt (version 2.50.0), Ensembl database (ensembl.org, release 107). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probeset to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned for every probeset that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "All procedures were approved by the Animal Protection Commission of the Kanton Bern, Switzerland, and were carried out according to the newest guiding principles for research (3). Female C57BL/6 mice (~4 mo old) obtained from the Institut für Labortierkunde (Max Gassmann, Zurich, Switzerland) were used for all experiments. The animals were housed in a care facility with a 12:12-h light/dark cycle at a constant temperature of 22 C and maintained on a diet of standard chow with water ad libitum. All mice were kept individually in Macrolon type III cages (Indulab, Italy) for 7 days of acclimatization before they either underwent HS for 7 days or remained in identical cages without suspension (control, n equals 12). After HS the animals were either euthanized directly (HS7; n equals 23) or resumed ambulatory cage activity (reloading) for 1 (R1; n equals 13) or 7 days (R7; n equals 9).\nHS was performed using a modification of a protocol for tail suspension of mice. Before the suspension procedure, each mouse was weighed and slightly anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg body mass) to attach the suspension device. A swivel hook was fixed with a strip (~12 cm × 1.0 cm) of adhesive tape (Leukotape classic; BSN Medical SAS, Vibraye, France) distally at half the distance to the tails tip, thereby enclosing the tail on both sides. Two hours after recovery from anesthesia, the swivel hook was raised to a movable X-Y system preventing the mouse from touching the ground with its hindlimbs while permitting free movement within the entire cage. Control animals were anesthetized in the same way as the suspended ones.\nThe mice were weighed and anesthetized with a cocktail containing ketamine (74.0 mg/ml), xylazine (3.8 mg/ml), and acepromazine (0.7 mg/ml) at a dose of 3.0 ml/kg body mass. All HS animals were anesthetized without allowing them to touch the ground with their hindlimbs, and their body mass was determined 5 min after application of anesthesia. Both soleus muscles were excised 20 min after anesthesia, weighed, and either frozen within 60 s in isopentane cooled by liquid nitrogen and stored in liquid nitrogen until analysis or processed for electron microscopy as mentioned below. The anesthetized animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation.     For extraction of total RNA, a modification of the RNeasy mini-protocol (Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland) for skeletal muscle was used. Integrity of the RNA was checked with denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis, and the concentration was quantified using the RiboGreen RNA quantification kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR).     Microarray experiments were carried out on a set (8 membranes) of custom-designed low-density Atlas cDNA expression arrays (BD Biosciences, Allschwil, Switzerland) with 222 double-spotted probes of mouse cDNAs associated with skeletal muscle form and function. 211 cDNA spots corresponded to confirmed probes. Eleven cDNAs were newly designed by BD Biosciences according to established criteria (details are available at the BD Biosciences website http://atlasinfo.clontech.com). Additionally, cDNA probes for the internal reference, 28S rRNA, were included on the nylon membrane. More details to this cDNA array can be found on gene expression omnibus (GEO, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under GPL1097.     Batches of four samples (control, HS7, R1, R7) were always processed simultaneously with n = 6, except for R7 (n = 5). RNA had to be pooled in several cases from two to four mice to yield sufficient RNA for one single array hybridization. Probe synthesis and hybridization was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions with modifications. Briefly, [alpha-32P]dATP-labeled target cDNA was generated from 3 ug of total RNA by using the 222 gene-specific primers supplied. SuperScript II (200 U; Life Technologies, Basel, Switzerland) was used as reverse transcriptase as well as modified nucleotides from the Strip-EZ RT kit (Ambion, Bioggio, Switzerland). These modified nucleotides allow the repeated use of the membranes up to five times without losing sensitivity. The labeled target cDNAs were purified by column chromatography, denatured, and hybridized to the membranes in ExpressHyb solution overnight at 68°C. Membranes were washed four times for 1 h in 2× SSC (0.3 M sodium chloride, 0.03 M sodium citrate), 1% SDS and once for 30 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.5% SDS at 68°C. A PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) was used to detect the cDNA signals after 5 days of exposure.\nThe signal for 28S rRNA was measured as an internal reference to standardize expression signals for different intensities occurring from varying input of RNA, [alpha-32P]dATP incorporation efficiency, or exposure time among the six array runs. Therefore, 1 ug of total RNA of each sample was always run in parallel for [alpha-32P]dATP-labeled cDNA generation with a specific primer for 28S rRNA. Then, 1 ul of the 28S rRNA probe was finally added to the labeled target cDNAs for hybridization as mentioned above. This dilution of the 28S rRNA probe (1:900) was performed to remain in the linear phase of signal detection.     For gene expression signal analysis, raw signals of each cDNA probe on the membrane were determined using AIDA Array Easy software (Raytest Schweiz, Urdorf, Switzerland). Raw signals were set as the mean values of the two spots containing the same cDNA. Background was determined as the mean of the signals from 100 empty spots in all of the 4 quadrants on the array. Signals of 166 genes were at least 30% above background on > 4 of 6 membranes. Only those genes were called “expressed” for that animal group and further examined.",

          "Study Description": "A recent physiological study established that hindlimb unloading of rats at 3 and 7 weeks inhibits healing of injured ligaments, resulting in a badly aligned, discontinuous collagen matrix. Using tissue from these rats, we focused on the 3-week time point employing microarray analysis to identify what cellular processes or lack of processes could account for these observed deficiencies. We used the Affymetrix RG_U34A GeneChip and performed image analysis with Microarray Suite 5.0. For normalization we used the MAS global normalization protocol with a default target mean signal of 500. Gene expression in medial collateral ligament tissue under 4 different treatment conditions was measured: loaded control, loaded wound healing, unloaded control, and unloaded wound healing. From our results, it appears that unloaded tissue lags behind loaded tissue in its progression through the healing process and at 3 weeks is still engaged in the proliferative phase, whereas loaded tissue is actively remodeling its collagen matrix.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Animals were handled to habituate to investigators and room settings for one week prior to the start of behavioral testing. Behavioral assays were performed in dark rooms during the animals’ wake cycle. A combination of Ethovision software analysis and scoring manually by one investigator was used for analysis. Ethovision and investigator scores were compared for cross-validation, and a second investigator scored trials where Ethovision and the first investigator differed by more than 5% of the score. All behavioral analysis was performed by two female investigators. Blinding to the group condition was not possible, due to the isolation housing and limited personnel. Behavioral assessments took several weeks due to the size of the cohort. Trials were balanced so all experimental groups were represented on each day of an assessment. For some assessments, males and females were run on alternate days. Equipment was cleaned with 70% ethanol between all trials. The order of behavioral tests was: Balance Beam, Elevated Plus Maze, Three Chamber Social Approach Task, Adhesive Removal, Open Field, Novel Object Recognition, and Radial Arm Water Maze.     Behavioral assays were performed in dark rooms during the animals’ wake cycle.     The maze was a circular pool with a diameter of 118.5 cm and eight arms 41 cm in length. The pool was filled with water and a non-toxic white paint (Crayola, 54-2128-053) was added to make the water opaque. An escape platform was placed at the end of one of the arms, hidden from view below the surface of the water. Visual cues were placed around the room.     Animals ran 1 day of 6 consecutive 60 s trials with a 10 min interval. At the start of each trial, animals were placed in a different arm not containing the escape platform. Animals unable to locate the platform were guided to the platform. Once any animal reached the platform, they remained on the platform for 10 s and were returned to the holding cage.     All assays were recorded using an overhead camera connected to the Ethovision XT 12.0 tracking system (Noldus Information Technology). The number of errors (entries into an arm without the escape platform) was determined by Ethovision software. The number of errors in trials 1–6 were averaged to calculate the “day average”.     All experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of University of California (San Francisco, Protocol Number: AN181839) and Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL, Upton, NY). Female (N equals 60) and male (N equals 60) C57BL6/J wildtype (WT) mice 24 weeks of age were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and directly delivered to BNL in grouped cages. Mouse ages were timed for comparability to previous experiments and to represent a middle-aged adult astronaut. One female animal died before the experiment began. Each experimental group was assigned 10 mice, except normally loaded SI females, which was assigned 9 mice. A power calculation was not used to determine sample size; sample size was selected based norms for behavioral testing and maximum total colony capacity for the lab staff. Female and male mice were housed in separate rooms at BNL on a normal 12:12 light cycle. Animals acclimated at BNL for 1 week before animals in the two social isolation groups were separated into isolation housing in HU cages at 25 weeks of age. All isolated animals subsequently remained isolated for the duration of the experiment. Group housed controls remained in standard cages. Mice in the SI+HU group were unloaded at 26 weeks of age by a pulley apparatus with orthopedic traction tape as previously described. The SI-only group remained normally loaded. Animals were checked twice a day, and re-loading events were recorded and corrected. At 27 weeks of age, animals underwent simplified 5-ion Galactic Cosmic Ray simulation (GCRsim) exposure at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory during their light cycle. Sham irradiated animals were loaded into the ‘mouse hotel’, but not placed on the beam line. The SI + HU group remained unloaded during irradiation. Animals were reloaded at 29 weeks of age, after a total of 18 days of HU. Following 5 days of recovery, mice were shipped to UCSF via World CourierTM for behavioral and cellular analysis. At UCSF, animals were housed on a reverse light cycle in environmentally controlled conditions (12:12 h light:dark cycle at 21 ± 1 °C; ~ 50% humidity) with access to food and water ad libidum. Female and male mice were housed in the same room.     Mice were irradiated with 50 cGy of the NASA-approved simplified GCRsim protocol during the experimental campaign NSRL21A. The simplified GCRsim consisted of 35% protons (1000 meV), 1% silicon, 18% helium, 6% oxygen, 1% iron, and 39% protons (250 MeV). Energies were 1000 MeV/n protons (LET equals 0.20 keV/μm), 600 MeV/n silicon ions (LET equals 50.4 keV/μm), 250 MeV/n helium ions (LET equals 1.60 keV/ μm), 350 MeV/n oxygen ions (LET equals 20.9 keV/μm), and 250 MeV/n protons (LET equals 0.40 keV/μm). Mice were transported to the NSRL the night before exposure and returned to the animal care facility several hours after irradiation. During each exposure, mice were loaded into 7.3 × 4.0 × 4.0 cm polystyrene restraint boxes with air holes and mounted on the beam line. SI + HU animals remained at a declining angle by means of a wire attached to the tail harness and fixed to the restraint box holder outside the box. Due to the size of the box, hindlimbs could touch the wall of the restraint box. The beam spot size was 60×60 cm and animals were placed in the center of the field to assure best uniformity. The measured doses for the four runs were 50.0020 cGy delivered over 17.46 min, 50.0034 cGy delivered over 12.28 min, 50.0029 cGy delivered over 27.99 min, and 50.0021 cGy delivered over 42.76 min. NSRL GCR and SPE simulations are designed to approximate the chronic mixed field exposures in space by means of sequential acute exposures to a variety of ion/energy combinations.  The exposure protocols are on the NSRL website: https://www.bnl.gov/nsrl/userguide/simgcrsim.php (SimGCRSim).  The dose can be administered either in a single series of exposures lasting approximately an hour or in daily fractions over several weeks.  The GCR simulations are described in detail here: Simonsen LC, Slaba TC, Guida P, Rusek A (2020) NASA’s first ground-based Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: Enabling a new era in space radiobiology research.

Behavioral assays were performed in dark rooms during the animals’ wake cycle. All behavioral analysis was performed by two female investigators. Equipment was cleaned with 70% ethanol between all trials. Anxiety was assessed at 33 weeks of age using the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM). Bright white lights were used to illuminate the open arms.     The EPM apparatus consisted of two exposed open arms (35 cm) opposite each other, orthogonal to two enclosed arms (30.5 cm) opposite from each other, creating a ‘plus’ shape with a center platform of 4.5 cm2. The apparatus was elevated 40 cm off the floor.     Individual mice were placed in the center zone, with their nose directed into an enclosed arm. Activity on the maze was recorded over 5 min. Time in the open arms + center was recorded in seconds. Animals that fell from the apparatus were replaced, but their data was excluded from analysis.

All behavioral analysis was performed by two female investigators. Blinding to the group condition was not possible, due to the isolation housing and limited personnel.     The three-chamber social approach task was conducted when animals were 34–35 weeks of age to test sociability and social memory. The order of behavioral tests was: Balance Beam, Elevated Plus Maze, Three Chamber Social Approach Task, Open Field, Novel Object Recognition, and Radial Arm Water Maze.     Animals were handled to habituate to investigators and room settings for one week prior to the start of behavioral testing. Behavioral assays were performed in dark rooms during the animals’ wake cycle. All behavioral analysis was performed by two female investigators. Equipment was cleaned with 70% ethanol between all trials.     The total arena was 72 cm by 50 cm, and each chamber was 24 cm by 50 cm.     Individual animals were placed in the center chamber of a three chamber arena. The first stage, or habituation phase, consisted of 10 min of free exploration without any objects in the arena. The second phase measured sociability by placing an empty cage (10 cm in diameter) into one chamber of the arena, and an age- and sex-matched mouse (conspecific) not previously encountered into an identical cage in the opposite chamber of the arena. Cages were approximately 30 cm apart. Experimental animals explored the arena for 10 min. Placement of the conspecific mouse was alternated between the left and right chamber for each trial. Exploration was measured for 5 min, and time (in seconds) interacting with the novel and familiar mouse already encountered in the previous phase was recorded. A novel sex- and age-matched mouse was placed into the previously empty cage. Conspecifics consisted of two cages (four mice per cage) of nonaggressive, sex- and age-matched non-littermate mice). Investigators avoided odor mixing by cleaning the apparatus and cages with 70% ethanol and changing gloves each time they touched a new mouse. All four mice were used in all groups, and no aversions were noted.     Interactions with the empty cage or conspecific mouse were defined as instances when the nose point of the experimental mouse was less than 5 mm from the respective cage. The first 5 min of exploration were used for analysis. Time (in seconds) with the cage and conspecific mouse were recorded for analysis. Sociability was assessed using % interaction time with mouse equals ((time of nose interaction with mouse)/(total time of nose interaction with mouse + empty cage)) × 100. Social memory was measured in the third phase of the task. Social memory was assessed using the % interaction time with novel mouse equals ((interaction time with novel mouse)/(total nose interaction with novel+familiar mice))×100.     The order of behavioral tests was: Balance Beam, Elevated Plus Maze, Three Chamber Social Approach Task, Adhesive Removal, Open Field, Novel Object Recognition, and Radial Arm Water Maze.     Animals were handled to habituate to investigators and room settings for one week prior to the start of behavioral testing. Behavioral assays were performed in dark rooms during the animals’ wake cycle. All behavioral analysis was performed by two female investigators. Equipment was cleaned with 70% ethanol between all trials. Anxiety was assessed  at 39 weeks of age using the Open Field (OF).     The Open Field test took place in a 30 cm by 30 cm arena for 10 min under red lighting. Mice explored freely and activity was recorded. Time spent (in seconds) in the center 17 cm by 17 cm zone was analyzed to assess anxiety-like behavior.     All assays were recorded using an overhead camera connected to the Ethovision XT 12.0 tracking system (Noldus Information Technology). A combination of Ethovision software analysis and scoring manually by one investigator was used for analysis.

A 30 cm by 30 cm by 30 cm arena was used. Interactions were defined as instances where the nose point was less than 5 mm from the object. During the habituation phase on the first 2 days, animals explored freely for 10 min per day. During the training phase on day 3, two identical Duplo red blocks were secured to the floor of the arena in opposite corners.     Mice were given 5 min to freely explore the objects. During the testing phase on day 4, one of the Duplo red blocks (familiar object) was replaced with a novel object–a Duplo orange flower. Mice were given 5 min to freely explore.     Interactions were defined as instances where the nose point was less than 5 mm from the object. Percent time with the novel object was defined as the time in seconds spent with the novel object divided by the total time in seconds spent with the novel + familiar objects.     The order of behavioral tests was: Balance Beam, Elevated Plus Maze, Three Chamber Social Approach Task, Adhesive Removal, Open Field, Novel Object Recognition, and Radial Arm Water Maze. During the Training phase, trials ended when the mouse entered the goal box, or when 2 min had elapsed. The mouse was allowed 15 s in the goal box upon arrival before it was removed back to the home cage and given a 10-min rest period before the Testing phase.     Animals were handled to habituate to investigators and room settings for one week prior to the start of behavioral testing.

For some assessments, males and females were run on alternate days. Equipment was cleaned with 70% ethanol between all trials. Two overhead lights were directed onto the starting platform and beam, while the goal box remained shaded. Testing was conducted in the housing room.     The Balance Beam was manufactured by Conduct Science (ME-BB-M01) and consisted of a level plastic beam 80 cm long and of either 11 mm or 5 mm width, elevated 60 cm above the floor by two posts, with a dark goal box on the left, and a starting platform on the right. A hammock was placed below the beam to cushion falls. During the Testing phase, the 11 mm beam was replaced with the 5 mm beam.     The mouse was placed on the beam just past the right-hand starting platform, to encourage travel across the beam. The mouse was allowed to freely traverse the beam, and the trial ended when the mouse reached the goal box or when 2 min elapsed.     All assays were recorded using an overhead camera connected to the Ethovision XT 12.0 tracking system (Noldus Information Technology). A combination of Ethovision software analysis and scoring manually by one investigator was used for analysis. Ethovision and investigator scores were compared for cross-validation, and a second investigator scored trials where Ethovision and the first investigator differed by more than 5% of the score. All behavioral analysis was performed by two female investigators. Blinding to the group condition was not possible, due to the isolation housing and limited personnel. Main measures of the assay were distance traveled and velocity. Footfalls were not quantified due to frequent use of a ‘scootching’ strategy, where the mouse pinched the sides of the beam between its hind paws to move forward.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining. One animal (426) was excluded from all assays due to early euthanasia.",

          "Study Description": "Interplanetary space travel poses many hazards to the human body. To protect astronaut health and performance on critical missions, there is first a need to understand the effects of deep space hazards, including ionizing radiation, confinement, and altered gravity. Previous studies of rodents exposed to a single such stressor document significant deficits, but our study is the first to investigate possible cumulative and synergistic impacts of simultaneous ionizing radiation, confinement, and altered gravity on behavior and cognition. Our cohort was divided between 6‐month‐old female and male mice in group, social isolation, or hindlimb unloading housing, exposed to 0 or 50 cGy of 5 ion simplified simulated galactic cosmic radiation (GCRsim). We report interactions and independent effects of GCRsim exposure and housing conditions on behavioral and cognitive performance. Exposure to GCRsim drove changes in immune cell populations in peripheral blood collected early after irradiation, while housing conditions drove changes in blood collected at a later point. Female mice were largely resilient to deficits observed in male mice. Finally, we used principal component analysis to represent total deficits as principal component scores, which were predicted by general linear models using GCR exposure, housing condition, and early blood biomarkers. This dataset derives results from the behavior assays Balance Beam, Elevated Plus Maze, Open Field, Three Chamber Social Approach, Novel Object Recognition, and Radial Arm Water Maze using the same source animals as the flow cytometry blood samples in OSD-640.",
