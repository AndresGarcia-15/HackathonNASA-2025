          "Study Protocol Description": "Sterilized seeds of wild-type (ecotype Columbia-0) were planted on growth media (1.2% phyta-agar) consisting of 0.5X Murashige-Skoog (MS) salts and 1% (w/v) sucrose (pH of 5.7) layered onto 90 X 90 mm square Petri dishes (Simport Scientific Inc., Beloeil, Quebec, Canada).\n\nImmediately after planting, Petri dishes containing the seeds were exposed to far-red (FR) light (3.2 micromole per square meter per second) for 10 minutes using a specially constructed rectangular metal box as described in Nakashima et al. (2014). Such FR treatment promotes dormancy in A. thaliana seeds, preventing premature germination prior to arrival in orbit. A single light emitting diode (LED) (ER-R2, 4606, Norlux Corporation, Carol Stream, Illinois, USA) was used to provide FR illumination to the seeds inside the Petri dishes. FR treatment was carried out under dim light with the distance between the FR LED and Petri dish set at 70 mm. Petri dishes were immediately wrapped with a layer of aluminum foil after FR treatment to keep seeds in complete darkness during imbibition. Petri dishes were then stored in a 4C refrigerator prior to launch. The Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Dragon Spacecraft on the SpaceX Commercial Resupply Service (CRS)-5 mission was launched from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 4:47 A.M. (EST) on January 10, 2015.\n\nTo activate the experiment and trigger germination while in orbit, the aluminum foil was removed, and the Petri dishes were installed in the Veggie plant growth hardware. One Veggie unit was located at the ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES) located at the SSPF and used as the ground controls. The other unit was located in the Columbus module on the ISS and used as the spaceflight set. LEDs on Veggie were programmed to provide constant white light at an intensity of 120-140 micromole per square meter per second. Temperature in the Veggie was maintained at 24C. After the Petri plates were installed in Veggie, seedlings were harvested at 6 and 11 days.     Seedlings were harvested at 6 and 11 days after experiment activation and transferred to Kennedy Fixation Tubes (KFTs), containing either RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) or 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde and 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde (both from Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2). Harvesting and fixation on KFTs was performed by Expedition 42 commander Barry Wilmore who completed the process in 2 hours. KFTs containing the chemicals were kept in the dark and at 4C until fixation. Details on KFT actuation are described in Nakashima et al. (2014). Actuated KFTs with RNAlater were stored in a -80C laboratory freezer (ground controls), or in the Minus Eighty-Degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI), whereas those with aldehydes were kept at 4C. Samples returned to Earth at 4:44 P.M. (PST) on February 11, 2015. Fixed seedlings were retrieved from the KFTs at KSC four days after the Dragon Spacecraft splash down and were turned over to the investigator team three days later. Individual seedlings fixed by paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde mixture were then carefully separated into shoots and roots, and photographed prior to processing for microscopy. Seedlings from spaceflight and corresponding ground controls fixed in RNAlater were thawed, dried using Kimwipes, ground in liquid nitrogen, and stored in -80F prior to RNA isolation.     Seedlings from spaceflight and corresponding ground controls fixed in RNAlater were thawed, dried using Kimwipes, ground in liquid nitrogen, and stored in -80F prior to RNA isolation. Seedlings were divided into shoots and roots, and total RNA was isolated using Plant RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The pellet of cell-debris in the QIAGEN shredder spin columns were saved and processed for glycomics. Glycome profiling of cell wall extracts was conducted using a single step extraction. Briefly, alcohol insoluble materials from root debris were first isolated and extracted with a 4 M KOH solution containing 1% (w/v) sodium borohydride. The extract was dialyzed exhaustively against water and lyophilized before subjecting to glycome profiling. The 4 M KOH extract was then screened by ELISA using a comprehensive suite of plant cell wall glycan-directed mAbs that recognized most of the major non-cellulosic glycan epitopes in plant cell walls. ELISAs were performed by coating 0.3 μg glucose equivalents of carbohydrate materials onto the each well of a 384-well dish (Costar 3700, Corning Inc, Corning, NY, USA). ELISAs were conducted with a fully automated robotic system (Automated ELISA Workstation, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Waltham, MA, USA). The ELISA response values are depicted as heat maps to reflect the relative abundance of glycan epitopes recognized by the mAbs.",

Based on our previous space flight studies using the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware on the STS-131 Space Shuttle mission, we found that plants respond to microgravity in large part through the transcriptional reprogramming of genes that control cell wall remodeling. This follow-up spaceflight experiment called the Advanced Plant EXperiments (APEX 03-1) in Space was designed to use Veggie unit on the ISS and on the ground unit on the Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF) to probe deeper into spaceflight-induced cell wall associated transcript expression changes. In this study we used RNA-Seq in combination with glycome profiling (glycomics) to correlate spaceflight-induced gene expression changes with actual cell wall modifications within seedlings.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "The Advanced Plant Experiment 04– Epigenetic Expression (APEX-04-EpEx) spaceflight experiment was launched onto International Space Station (ISS) through the SpaceX mission CRS-10. In brief, seeds were sterilized and sown on growth medium containing 0.5% phytagel, 0.5× Murashige–Skoog salts, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose, and 1 × Gamborg’s Vitamin Mixture, in Petri dishes (100 mm × 15 mm; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, USA), which were then sealed with breathable tape (3 M Micropore, Maplewood, USA). Plants were grown in the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) facility on the ISS and the Veggie hardware in the ISS environmental simulator (ISSES) chamber at Kennedy Space Center under constant LED light of 100–135 µmol/m2s Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) until 11 days after germination. Plates were held in place within Veggie using the APEX Petri Plate Holder. Veggie was outfitted with a holder that allowed for the lighting from the Veggie unit to illuminate the science within.     Harvest was conducted on-orbit using RNALater (Ambion, Grand Island, USA) in Kennedy Space Center fixation tubes (KFTs). Plants from each plate were collected into individual KFTs and stored at -80 °C until delivery to the lab for analysis.     DNA extraction was conducted using the protocol designed for RNAlater preserved plant samples. Root and shoot samples were blotted with kimwipes, weighed, and rinsed twice in 3 mL of wash buffer (50 mM EDTA, 25 mM EGTA) for 10 minutes. Samples were blotted again on kimwipes and transferred to mortar and pestle and ground in liquid nitrogen. 900 µL of lysis buffer (10 mM EDTA, 50 mM EGTA, 50 mM Tris), 80 µL of proteinase K (80 mg/mL), and 100 µL of 10% SDS were added and further ground. Samples were incubated at 65°C overnight. 300 µL of 5M potassium acetate was added to each sample and put on ice for 30 minutes. Each sample was then spun in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 5 minutes, supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and spun for an additional 5 minutes. The supernatant was then split between two 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and 800 µL isopropanol was added and the tubes were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Tubes were then spun at maximum speed for 10 minutes, the liquid was poured off, and the resulting pellet was air-dried for 15 minutes at room temperature. Pellets were suspended in 50 µL of TER buffer (10 mM TrisHCl, 1 mM EDTA, 100 µg/µL RNase), split tubes were combined into one tube per sample and incubated at 60°C for 20 minutes. 100 µL of 25:24:1 phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol was added to each tube, mixed, and spun at max speed for 10 minutes. The aqueous (upper) phase was transferred to a new tube and 40 µL of 7.5 M ammonium acetate (AmOAc) and 300 µL of 95% ethyl alcohol (EtOH) were added, the tubes were inverted to mix, and placed at -20°C overnight. Tubes were then spun at 4°C for 10 minutes, the EtOH and AmOAc solution was poured off, and the pellets were rinsed with 70% EtOH three times, dried for 15 minutes and suspended in 100 µL 0.25x TE buffer.     The library construction of FENGC products on the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) Sequel IIe SMRT platform was performed by Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) at the University of Florida. Products of flap-enabled next-generation capture (FENGC) were subjected to EM-seq conversion and PCR using universal primers. Instrument: Sequel II, Strategy: Targeted-Capture, Source: OTHER, Selection: other, Layout: SINGLE. Approximately 200 ng of Arabidopsis genomic DNA was fragmented by sonication using a Bioruptor Pico (Diagenode, Denville, USA) for 6 cycles of 5 sec on and 30 sec off in 20 µl ddH~2~O. The concentration of oligo-1, -2, and − 3 was 18 nM each in the master tube as recommended. Flap cleavage was performed in the presence of FENGC universal oligo 1-T (U1-T oligo), flap oligos-1 and − 2 specific for 108 targets, and thermostable FEN1 (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, USA). Ligation was initiated by adding a stock mixture of oligos-3 for all 108 targets, U2 oligo, and Ampligase (Lucigen, Middleton, USA) to the same tube. DNA not ligated to U2 oligo and therefore not protected by 3’ C3 Spacer was removed by addition of exonucleases I and III (NEB, Ipswich, USA). The enriched products were purified and then subjected to enzymatic methylation conversion according to the manual of NEBNext Enzymatic Methyl-seq Conversion Module (NEB, Ipswich, USA). Converted DNA was amplified for 23 cycles using U1 and U2 primers and KAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil + DNA polymerase (Roche, Pleasanton, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. FENGC amplification products were purified and product quality and quantity were determined using Agilent TapeStation D1000 system (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) and Qubit 3 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, USA), respectively.     The sequencing of FENGC products on the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) Sequel IIe SMRT platform was performed by Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) at the University of Florida. The HiFi reads were generated using 30-h movie of circular consensus (CCS) mode with filtering for ≥ 3 passes per single polymerase read, with default settings for other parameters.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.",

Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) revealed distinct spaceflight associated methylation differences, presenting the need to explore specific space-altered methylation at single-molecule resolution to associate specific changes over large regions of spaceflight related genes. To date, tools of multiplexed targeted DNA methylation sequencing remain limited for plant genomes.

          "Study Protocol Description": "Arabidopsis thaliana L., ecotype Columbia-0 seeds were surface sterilized with 30% (v/v) bleach, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 for 2 mins, washed repeatedly with sterile water (5x) and dried on round filter paper. Approximately 30 seeds were plated on each 60mm round petri plate containing 6.7ml of 0.5x + Benomyl Murashige and Skoog (MS) growth media with Gamborg’s B5 vitamins, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose and 0.75% (w/v) phytagel, and cold stratified for 16h. Seeded plates were loaded in a horizontal orientation, with the face of the growth media parallel to the ground in the BRIC LED hardware petri dish fixation units (PDFUs). Each hardware canister holds 6 PDFUs, with each PDFU holding a 60mm petriplate. This configuration was replicated 6 times, making a total of 36 seeded 60mm plates loaded aboard ISS. All BRICs were kept in cold storage (4°C) prior to the spaceflight launch. The experiment was flown on the SpaceX CRS-13 mission launched aboard the Falcon 9 Full Thrust rocket on December 15, 2017. The dormant Arabidopsis seeds were activated with light and placed at ambient temperature aboard the ISS, with a light wavelength composition of 85% red, Q13 15% blue, and 60 μmol m-2 s-1 intensity. Due to hardware constraints, lighting could not be maintained longer than 4 hours at a time. The plants were grown for 10 days with a 4-hour/2-hour light-dark cycle. The experiment concluded with flooding the PDFUs with RNAlater.     Actuation of the PDFUs, released about 6-7ml RNAlater into the petri plates for seedling fixation on-orbit. The seedlings were then incubated in Invitrogen RNAlater for 12 hours after which they were frozen aboard the ISS at -80℃ till returned to Earth. A similar experimental setup was established on the ground at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in the Space Station Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber, USA.  Frozen plates containing both the spaceflight and ground samples were packed in dry ice and transported to Ohio University where they were stored at -80℃ prior to protein extraction and processing while another group was also sent to the University of Florida, Gainesville for RNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing.     Seedlings from spaceflight and ground controls were divided into root and shoot for soluble and membrane protein extractions according to a protocol adapted from (Basu et al., 2015). Approximately 0.1g of tissue per replicate was crushed in liquid nitrogen and vortexed thoroughly in the extraction buffer. The samples were subsequently centrifuged at 8000g and 100,000g to isolate membrane protein. Both the precipitated soluble protein stored in methanol and the membrane protein in microsome resuspension buffer were sent to the Proteomics and Metabolomics Facility, at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln for 6-plex TMT labeling and mass spectrometric analysis.     Briefly, protein samples were assayed using the CB-X protein assay from G-Bioscience. 100µg membrane and 200µg soluble samples in triplicates were reduced and trypsin digested.100µg of each was labeled with 0.8mg each of a unique 6-plexTandem Mass Tag (TMT). Labeled samples were combined into 4 6-plex experiments and 300µg of each was sub-fractioned into 96 fractions using high pH reverse phase C18 chromatography (ACQUITY UPLC® BEH™ C18, 1.7μm, 2.1 x 100mm, Waters Corp), and recombined according to the concatenated strategy of Yang et al. to give 6 total fractions. Each of the 6 fractions was analyzed by LC-MS/MS on an RSLCnano system (ThermoFisher Scientific) coupled to an Eclipse Orbitrap Tribrid mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific).     Following trapping of the peptides (Acclaim PepMap™ 100, 75μm x 2 cm, ThermoFisher Scientific), separation was performed on a C18 nano column (Acquity UPLC® M-class, Peptide CSH™ 130A, 1.7μm 75μm x 250mm, Waters Corp) at 300 nL/min with a linear gradient from 4-22% over 2 h for a total 2.5h run time.  Peptide  MS2 spectra were acquired using the ion trap with CID activation.  Synchronous Precursor Selection (SPS) using 10 notches was used for the acquisition of MS3 spectra to give the optimal quantification of reporter ion ratios. To minimize the collection of lengthy MS3 spectra, MS2 spectra underwent real-time searching against the canonical version of the Uniprot reference proteome of A. thaliana (downloaded on 17th Feb 2022) during spectral acquisition, with identification triggering MS3 acquisition.  High Field Asymmetric Waveform Ion Mobility Spectrometry (FAIMS Pro™ interface) was used to sub-fractionate peptide fractions using 3 compensation voltages (CVs of –40, -55 and -70) for deeper coverage. Both FAIMS and SPS help alleviate the negative influence of interfering ions and the ratio compression issues associated with TMT labeling.     Data were analyzed in Proteome Discoverer 2.4 software (ThermoFisher Scientific) using the Sequest HT search engine. Methionine oxidation was set as a variable modification, whilst TMT-6plex (K) and TMT-6plex (N-term) and cysteine carbamidomethylation were specified as fixed modifications. A maximum of 1 trypsin missed cleavages was permitted and the precursor and fragment mass tolerances were set to 10 ppm and 0.06 Da, respectively. Peptides were validated by Percolator with a 0.01 posterior error probability (PEP) threshold. The data were searched using a decoy database to set the false discovery rate to 1% (high confidence). The protein quantification was processed using the co-isolation threshold set to 50% and the average S/N to 10. The peptides were quantified using the peak intensity of the reporter ion in the MS2 spectrum. The peak abundance was normalized for differences in sample loading using total peptide amount where the peptide group abundances are summed for each sample and the maximum sum across all runs is determined. The pooled sample was used to normalize each TMT experiment based on the same sample. The protein ratios and log2 fold change are calculated from the grouped protein abundances. The significance of differential expression is tested using an ANOVA test which provides a p-value and an adjusted p-value using the Benjamini-Hochberg method for all the calculated ratios. Supplemental files contain excel files. Raw and CSV files are provided in the sample table for simplified analysis.     For each condition (Spaceflight and Ground), four individual plants from each replicate were pooled for RNA extraction. Individual plants were first dissected into leaves, hypocotyls, and root tissues under an Olympus dissecting microscope (Olympus, Japan). The intervening hypocotyls were set aside and not processed for downstream analyses. Leaf tissues without their hypocotyl are referred to herein as shoots and are the only ones processed for RNA analysis. RNA extraction was performed using the Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. RNA concentration was assessed using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA), and RNA quality was determined on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc., USA). For all samples, the RNA integrity number (RIN) was more than 6.     RNA-Sequencing Library Preparation was performed at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) Gene Expression Core (https://biotech.ufl.edu/gene-expression-genotyping/, RRID: SCR_019145). Here, 100 ng of total RNA was used for mRNA isolation using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs, catalog   E7490). Next, RNA library construction was done with the NEBNext Ultra II  Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, catalog  E7760) according to the manufacturer's user guide. Briefly, RNA was fragmented in NEBNext First Strand Synthesis Buffer via incubation at 94 °C for the desired time. This step was followed by first-strand cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primer.  Synthesis of ds-cDNA was performed using the 2nd strand master mix provided in the kit, followed by end-repair and adaptor ligation.  At this point, Illumina adaptors were ligated to the sample.  Finally, each library (uniquely barcoded) was enriched by 12 cycles of amplification, and purified with Agencourt AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter, catalog   A63881). The 12 barcoded libraries were sized on the Bioanalyzer and quantified with the Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer. Finally, these 20 individual libraries were pooled in equimolar concentration.     The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 was used to sequence the libraries for 2 x 150 cycles. Sequencing was performed at the ICBR NextGen Sequencing (https://biotech.ufl.edu/next-gen-dna/, RRID:SCR_019152). Normalized libraries were submitted to the “Free Adapter Blocking Reagent” protocol (FAB, Cat  20024145) to minimize the presence of adaptor-dimers and index hopping rates. The library pool was diluted to 0.8 nM and sequenced on one S4 flow cell lane (2x150 cycles) of the Illumina NovaSeq6000. The instrument’s computer utilized the NovaSeq Control Software v1.6. Cluster and SBS consumables were v1.5. The final loading concentration of the library was 120 pM with 1% PhiX spike-in control. One lane generated 2.5-3 billion paired-end reads (~950Gb) with an average Q30% 92.5% and Cluster PF 85.4%. FastQ files were generated using the BCL2fastQ function in the Illumina BaseSpace portal. One NovaSeq S4, 2x150 cycles lane resulted in an average of 50 Million demultiplexed, paired-end reads when sequencing a pool of 48 samples.     Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of A-thaliana rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.4/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Arabidopsis thaliana STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl Plants release 54, genome version TAIR10 (Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.toplevel.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.54.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis thaliana STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) to generate the RSEM_Unnormalized_Counts_GLbulkRNAseq.csv table.",

          "Study Description": "Spaceflight presents a unique environment with complex stressors, including microgravity and radiation, that can influence plant physiology at molecular levels. Combining transcriptomics and proteomics approaches, this research gives insights into the coordination of transcriptome and proteome in Arabidopsis’ molecular and physiological responses to Spaceflight environmental stress. Arabidopsis seedlings were germinated and grown in microgravity (µg) aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in NASA Biological Research in Canisters -Light Emitting Diode (BRIC LED) hardware, with the ground control established on Earth. At 10 days old, seedlings were frozen in RNA-later and returned to Earth. RNA-seq transcriptomics and TMT-labeled LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis of cellular fractionates from the plant tissues suggest the alteration of the photosynthetic machinery (PSII and PSI) in spaceflight, with the plant shifting photosystem core-regulatory proteins in an organ-specific manner to adapt to the microgravity environment. An overview of the ribosome, spliceosome, and proteasome activities in spaceflight revealed a significant abundance of transcripts and proteins involved in protease binding, nuclease activities, and mRNA binding in spaceflight, while those involved in tRNA binding, exoribonuclease activity, and RNA helicase activity were less abundant in spaceflight. CELLULOSE SYNTHASES (CESA1, CESA3, CESA5, CESA7) and CELLULOSE-LIKE PROTEINS (CSLE1, CSLG3), involved in cellulose deposition and TUBULIN COFACTOR B (TFCB) had reduced abundance in spaceflight. This contrasts with the increased expression of UDP-ARABINOPYRANOSE MUTASEs, involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides, in spaceflight. Both transcripts and proteome suggested an altered polar auxin redistribution, lipid, and ionic intracellular transportation in spaceflight. Analyses also suggest an increased metabolic energy requirement for plants in Space than on Earth, hence, the activation of several shunt metabolic pathways. This study provides novel insights, based on integrated RNA and protein data, on how plants adapt to the spaceflight environment and it is a step further at achieving sustainable crop production in Space.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Three lines of Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) including two wild-types, Columbia-0 (Col-0) and Wassilewskija (Ws), and a Col-0 PHYD mutant (phyD, SALK_027956C), were grown in phytagel plates on orbit or at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) within the ISS Environment Simulator (ISSES) Chamber for 11 days. Six plates were used for each genotype and 11 seedlings were planted in each plate. Seedlings were grown in the ambient, diffuse light (4–6 μmol m–2 s−1) of the ISS cabin wall, or in the dark (plates were unwrapped for 4 h to activate germination, then re-wrapped by black-out cloth, which were also affixed to the wall). The ground control in the ISSES (ISS Environmental Simulation) chamber of KSC were performed 24 h later than spaceflight samples, allowing the manipulation of lighting and atmospheric composition for the ISSES to mimic the conditions that plants were experiencing on the ISS.     The 11-day old plants were harvested into RNAlater in Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tubes (KFTs) and kept for 12–18 h at ambient temperature to ensure perfusion before being transferred to the MELFI freezer for storage on orbit. The KFTs were also kept frozen in transit to Earth and KSC, and during the transportation back to UF Space Plants Lab.     Seedlings frozen in RNAlater were thawed at 4 °C and then leaf tissues were dissected from the hypocotyl using a dissecting microscope and collected. The plants used in this study were from the same plates as those used for the collection of root tips in OSD-120. All leaves from one plate were pooled for RNA extraction, thus one plate comprised a biological replicate. RNA extraction was conducted using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, USA).     Three biological replicates were used for RNA-seq. RNA samples were multiplexed and sequenced in the NovaSeq 6000 platform with 2 × 150 bp reads at the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR), University of Florida, including Core of Gene Expression and Genotyping (RRID:SCR_019145) for library construction and Core of NextGen DNA sequencing (RRID:SCR_019152) for sequencing.

Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.At.tair.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Description": "The Characterizing Arabidopsis Root Attractions (CARA) spaceflight experiment provides comparative transcriptome analyses of plants grown in both light and dark conditions within the same spaceflight. CARA compared three genotypes of Arabidopsis grown in ambient light and in the dark on board the International Space Station (ISS); Col-0, Ws, and phyD, a phytochrome D mutant in the Col-0 background. In all genotypes, leaves responded to spaceflight with a higher number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) than root tips, and each genotype displayed distinct light / dark transcriptomic patterns that were unique to the spaceflight environment. The Col-0 leaves exhibited a substantial dichotomy, with ten-times as many spaceflight DEGs exhibited in light-grown plants versus dark-grown plants. Although the total number of DEGs in phyD leaves is not very different from Col-0, phyD altered the manner in which light-grown leaves respond to spaceflight, and many genes associated with the physiological adaptation of Col-0 to spaceflight were not represented. This result is in contrast to root tips, where a previous CARA study showed that phyD substantially reduced the number of DEGs. There were few DEGs, but a series of space-altered gene categories, common to genotypes and lighting conditions. This commonality indicates that key spaceflight genes are associated with signal transduction for light, defense, and oxidative stress responses. However, these key signaling pathways enriched from DEGs showed opposite regulatory direction in response to spaceflight under light and dark conditions, suggesting a complex interaction between light as a signal, and light-signaling genes in acclimation to spaceflight.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Whatman grade 17 CHR chromatography paper and black gridded polyethersulfone (PES) membrane (PALL Life Sciences, 65561) were cut to fit the seed cassettes. The blotter paper was pre-soaked in 0.5 x Murashige and Skoog (MS) media (without sucrose), and blotter paper and membranes were sterilized by autoclaving. Seeds were surface sterilized and allowed to dry. Healthy seeds with well-developed endosperm were selected under a dissecting microscope and mounted to the gridded membrane using guar gum. Seeds were positioned with the micropyle pointing down (away from lights) with 27 seeds/membrane. Gridded membrane/blotter paper sandwiches were fixed to the base plate, the covers were attached and sealed with aluminum foil tape (3M, 425). Dormant seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 Wild Type (from internal lab stock of Dr. Imara Perera) were launched and hydrated once on board the ISS and installed into the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS). The experiment is conducted in the EMCS, utilizing the on-orbit centrifuges and experiment unique containers. One rotor spins at 1g while the second rotor remains stationary (micro-g). Seedlings are grown for 4 or 6 days under a dark light cycle. A staggered hydration schedule was used so that some samples were hydrated and grown for 6 days, while others were hydrated 2 days later and grew for 4 days. Each rotor holds 4 Experimental Containers (EC)s, and each EC holds 5 separate seed cassettes with 27 seeds each. Two consecutive experiments are run back to back. The ERM-2 software controls the day/light cycle, temperature, humidity, and atmospheric composition.     At the end of 6 day period, the seed cassettes are removed from the EC and stored in the Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) at -80°C, until return for further analysis.     RNA extracted using RNAqueous Micro Kit (Ambion)     Sequencing was carried out by Novogene Corporation using NEB Next Ultra™ II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina     Sequencing was carried out by Novogene Corporation.\nIllumina HiSeq 150 bp PE     Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of A-thaliana rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.4/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Arabidopsis thaliana STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl Plants release 54, genome version TAIR10 (Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.toplevel.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.54.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis thaliana STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.At.tair.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Seeds were adhered to PES membrane on top of filter paper in EMCS cassettes. Filters were pre-soaked in 0.5x Murashige-Skoog salts, 1 mM MES, pH 5.7 and rehydrated on orbit with sterile, reagent-grade water. Seeds were grown at 1g under white light for 3 days.     At 3 days of growth the rotor was turned off inducing microgravity conditions. Unidirectional blue light was provided perpendicular to the previous direction of growth for 12 hours to induce phototropic bending. Seedlings were then given a fractional gravity stimulus for 36h to track gravitropic response of root tips of the two genotypes under different gravitational intensities. To test the interactions of gravity and light a subset of the samples experienced an alternative treatment : 12h white light 1g. 12h red light 1g. 48h white light 1g. 12h blue light 1g. 12h unidirectional blue light µg. 26h infrared for imaging at fractional g. This treatment was used for all samples at 0.107g, 0.127g, and 0.166g.\n\nLight Treatment 2: '12h white light. 12h red light. 48h white. 12h blue light. 12h unidirectional blue light' samples were exposed (during the 3 day growth period) to 12 hours of white light, followed by 12 hours of red light, followed by 48 hours of white light. During the treatment period those samples were exposed to a gravity + unidirectional blue light for first 12 hours of treatment, then the rotor was switched off and they received another 12 hours of unidirectional blue (same source as before) but without any centrifugation.\n\nLight Treatment 1: '24h light for 3 days. Blue light for 12 hours' samples were exposed (during the growth period) to 24 hours of white light for 3 days. During the treatment period those samples were exposed to 12 hours of blue light and 12 hours of gravity treatment.     Seedlings were dissected into root tip, mature root, hypocotyl, and cotyledon tissues. Half the seedlings from each cassette were pooled into one replicate, resulting in 8 samples per cassette (2x root tip, 2x mature root, 2x hypocotyl, 2x cotyledon). Cassettes were removed from -80 C and flooded with RNA extraction buffer to help release the tissue from the frozen PES membrane. After the membrane was flooded with RLT, all the root tips were excised at one time and placed in two bead tubes with RLT extraction buffer. Half were collected for one replicate and half were collected for a second replicate. This strategy was repeated for mature root, then hypocotyl, then cotyledon tissues.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation. Run 1: 2018-02-03 to 2018-02-8, Run 2: 2018-02-15 to 2018-02-20, Run 3: 2018-02-24 to 2018-03-01, Run 4: 2018-04-07 to 2018-04-12     RNA was extracted per manufacturer’s recommended protocol for the RNeasy kit. Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer was the QA instrument.     Takara SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit was used for library prep with Nextera DNA Library kit for sample indexing.     Sequencing was performed on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 using a NovaSeq S2 flow cell. There are 2 raw fastq files per sample.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Total RNA was extracted from rosette leaves of WT plants and FG plants grown under the LD and the SD in space and on ground, respectively. Each treatment included four full expansion rosette leaves from two different plants. The RNA was then purified using miRNeasy Mini Kit (Cat 217004, QIAGEN, GmBH, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions and checked for a RIN number to inspect RNA integration by an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2,100 (Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US). RNA was amplified, labeled, and purified by using GeneChip 3′ IVT PLUS Reagent Kit (Cat 902416, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, US) following the manufacturer’s instructions to obtain biotin labeled cRNA.     RNA amplified, labeled and purified by using GeneChip 3' IVT PLUS Reagent Kit (Cat 902416, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, US) following the manufacturer’s instructions to obtain biotin labeled cRNA     Array hybridization and wash was performed using GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit (Cat 900720, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, US) in Hybridization Oven 645 (Cat 00-0331-220V, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, US) and Fluidics Station 450 (Cat 00-0079, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, US) following the manufacturer’s instructions.     Slides were scanned by GeneChip® Scanner 3000 (Cat 00-00212, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, US) and Command Console Software 4.0 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, US) with default settings.     Raw data were normalized by MAS 5.0 algorithm, Affymetrix packages in R. Probe sets with signal values lower than the detectable range were adjusted to 75 and probe sets with the values of 75 for all conditions were removed from subsequent analysis. The averages of normalized ratios are calculated by dividing the average of normalized signal channel intensity by the average of the normalized control channel intensity. The standard deviation of the ground control (two biological replicates) was employed to identify genes of significant changes relative to the ground controls (P value less than 0.05). Only genes that showed transcript level changes in at least two folds in comparison with its ground control and with the same tendency in both biological replicates were considered as relevant for microgravity.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.3 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.3/Microarray/Affymetrix/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAffymetrix). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.4). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using oligo (version 1.58.0). Raw data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). The raw probe level intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the oligo (version 1.58.0) quantile method. Normalized probe level data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). Normalized probe level data was summarized to the probeset level using the oligo (version 1.58.0) RMA method. Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probeset using the Plants Ensembl database ftp server (plants.ensembl.org, release 54). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probeset to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned for every probeset that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.At.tair.db (version 3.15.0).     The plant growth system used for the SJ-10 experiment consisted of four growth compartments, illumination, photograph, air-flowing heating, and humidity controlling system. Plants had about six to seven rosette leaves when they were loaded into the growth chamber. Two set of plants were prepared and placed in the plant growth units (PGUs) for spaceflight experiment and the ground control, respectively. The flight PGU was positioned in the capsule of satellite SJ-10 about 8 h prior to launch. The SJ-10 satellite was in orbit for about 12 days and 15 h (launch: 1:38, April 6, 2016; landing: 16:30, April 18, 2016). Illumination was provided by light banks made up of 200 solid state light emitting diode (LED) lamps (400–700 nm white light and red light, 2:1) in LD (16 h light/8 h dark) and SD (8 h light/16 h dark) photoperiod conditions, respectively. Inside the chambers, temperatures were 22 plus or minus 2C, relative humidity was between 90 and 100%. The photosynthetically active photon flux density produced by LED lamps was 120 μmol m−2. s−1 for Arabidopsis at the surface of the first leaf of the experimental plants. Temperature and humidity were recorded every 1 min during flight. These data were used to set the ground control in a control PGU. Three digital cameras were mounted in the PGU to allow the recording of plant growth and development of plants in space. Photographic equipment consisted of two digital cameras (image size 1,280 × 1,024 pixels) and one GFP fluorescence camera, which was automatic and preprogrammed and allowed the recording of plants in PGUs both in visible light and in GFP fluorescence. The photographs were taken at 2 h intervals during the light period. Two digital cameras were used for photographed seedlings grown under the LD and the SD conditions, respectively. The GFP fluorescence camera was used to follow the expression of GFP in seedlings after heating was induced. All manipulations involved in the experiment were automated or carried out by remote control.     The plant growth system used for the SJ-10 experiment consisted of four growth compartments, illumination, photograph, air-flowing heating, and humidity controlling system. Plants had about six to seven rosette leaves when they were loaded into the growth chamber. Two set of plants were prepared and placed in the plant growth units (PGUs) for spaceflight experiment and the ground control, respectively. The flight PGU was positioned in the capsule of satellite SJ-10 about 8 h prior to launch. The SJ-10 satellite was in orbit for about 12 days and 15 h (launch: 1:38, April 6, 2016; landing: 16:30, April 18, 2016).     After SJ-10 satellite return to Earth (after 12 days and 15 h in orbi) the PGU was unloaded and received at a temporary laboratory in the landing site about 2 h post-landing. Plants were harvested and fixed with RNAlater solution (ambion, Austin, TX, United States ) at the landing site. The samples were then brought to our Shanghai laboratory where they were analyzed for transcriptional changes.",

          "Study Description": "Spaceflight has an impact on growth and development of higher plants at both vegetative stage and reproductive stage. A great deal of information has been available on the vegetative stage in space, but relatively little is known about the influence of spaceflight on plants at the reproductive stage. In this study, we constructed a transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants expressing flowering control gene, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), together with green fluorescent protein gene(GFP) under control of a heat shock-inducible promoter (HSP17.4), by which we induced FT expression inflight through remote controlling heating shock (HS) treatment. Inflight photography data showed that induction of FT expression in plants in space under short-day condition could eliminated the difference of stem length between spaceflight and ground control . Whole-genome microarray analysis of gene expression changes in leaves of wild-type and these transgenic plants grown under the long-day and short-day photoperiod conditions in space indicated that the function of the photoperiod-related spaceflight responsive genes are mainly involved in protein synthesis and post-translation protein modulation, notably protein phosphorylation. In addition, changes of circadian component gene expression in response to spaceflight under different photoperiod indicated that roles of circadian oscillator could act as integrators of spaceflight response and photoperiodic signals in Arabidopsis plants grown in space.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Seedlings stored in RNA later were recovered from -80°C freezer. Each tube containing the seedlings was allowed to thaw in the fridge overnight. After completely thawing the samples to room temperature, the seedlings were observed under the microscope. The preserved seedlings from the spaceflight and ground control harvests were dissected into distinct plant parts: leaf, hypocotyl, and root. DNA extraction was done using a modified phenol/chloroform protocol (LeFrois et al., 2016) and genomic-wide bisulfite sequencing was performed using a similar procedure as described by (Wang et al., 2013). 700-1700 ng of genomic DNA ( greater than 5 Kb in length) observed on the TapeStation Genomic Screen Tape (Agilent) was processed for sequencing library construction. DNA was transferred into 6 × 16 mm glass microtubes with AFA fiber and pre-slit snap caps (Cat  520045, Covaris, Inc.) and sheared into an average fragment size of ∼400 bp using the Covaris S220 ultrasonic disruptor. Short DNA fragments (less than 100 bp) were removed using AMPure magnetic beads (Cat  A63881, Beckman Coulter) at a 1:1 bead to sample ratio. 100–250 ng of clean, fragmented DNA was used for the Illumina sequencing library construction.     Illumina libraries (containing methylated adaptors) were subjected to sodium bisulfite treatment using the EZ DNA Methylation Direct kit (ZYMO Research, Cat  D5020) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting libraries were enriched by a 13-15 cycle amplification using an uracil-insensitive polymerase (EpiMark hot start Taq polymerase, NEB, Cat M0490S). The amplified library products were separated on a 2% agarose gel from which library fragments in the 250-500 bp range were excised (QIAquick gel extraction kit, Cat  28704, QIAGEN) and AMPure purified (Cat  A63881, Beckman Coulter). Gel staining was done with SYBR safe (Life Technologies) and visualized on a blue light transilluminator (Life Technologies) to avoid UV damage to the DNA. The final libraries were quantitated by the QUBIT fluorometer, sized on the Agilent TapeStation (DNA5000 Screen Tape) and by qPCR with the Kapa SYBR Fast qPCR reagents (Cat  KK4824, Kapa Biosystems) with monitoring on an ABI7900HT real-time PCR system (LifeTechnologies). The average library size was 350 bp. Care was taken to generate WGBS libraries that were approximately the same size as the RNA-Seq libraries.     Sequencing experiments were performed at the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) gene expression and sequencing core, University of Florida. Uniquely barcoded libraries were normalized to 2.5 nM and pooled (equimolarly) for sequencing on the HiSeq3000 Illumina sequencer. Bisulfite-converted sequencing libraries were sequenced together with RNAseq libraries (uniquely barcoded) to maximize data output. The RNAseq libraries in the pool served to compensate for the low base diversity of bisulfite-converted genomic libraries. The final library was created by mixing RNA-seq vs bisulfite-converted libraries at a 60%:40% ratio, with a mere 1% PhiX spike-in. Library pools were processed according the Illumina protocol (HiSeq3000) for clustering on the cBOT machine. After denaturation, neutralization and mixing with the ExAmp reagent, the final pool concentration for clustering was 0.25 nM. Sequencing was done using a 2x101 cycles format (paired-end configuration). The 48-sample project was sequenced on 12 lanes for a robust reads/lane output.\n\nGeneLab concatenated the submitted raw data files to be one forward and one reverse read each sample.     Dry, sterilized Arabidopsis seeds were planted aseptically on the surface of 10-cm2 solid media plates comprised of 0.5% Phytagel/0.5x MS media, and then immediately wrapped in light-tight black cloth (Duvetyne, SeattleFabrics.com) and transported to KSC (Kennedy Space Center), FL, USA. The wrapped plates were stored at temperatures between 4 and 10 °C until launch within a cold stowage bag nominally at 4 °C. The seeds remained dormant until removed from cold stowage and exposed to light at the initiation of the experiment on the ISS (International Space Station). Plant growth on the ISS and ISSES: The plates were installed into the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) hardware on the ISS and a comparable set installed into the Veggie hardware on the ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). These plates made up the NASA Advanced Plant Experiment 04 – Epigenetic Expression (APEX04-EPX) experiment that was launched on the SpaceX mission CRS-10. Plants in the Veggie hardware were exposed to constant light conditions of 100-135 umoles/m2/s PAR and grown for eleven days (11d) before being harvested into Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tubes (KFTs) and fixed in RNAlater (Ambion, Grand Island, NY, USA). Samples from each plate were harvested into individual KFTs. The KFTs were then stowed at -80°C in the MELFI freezer aboard the ISS. The ground control plates were grown inside the Veggie ground unit within the ISSES (International Space Station Environment Simulator) chamber at KSC with the 48-h delay. The ISSES chamber replicated the temperature, CO2 levels and lighting that had been experienced by the spaceflight plants in the previous 48 h. Ground control plants were harevested after 11 days of growth into KFTs with RNAlater and stored in a at -80°C freezer.     At 11 days, seedlings were harvested by an astronaut into KFT (Kennedy Fixation Tube) containing RNAlater solutions. Once the plants were placed in the KFTs, the KFT was actuated with RNAlater to preserve the sample. At 24 hours post-harvest, KFTs were then transferred to MELFI freezer. Following Dragon Capsule splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, the KFTs transferred to the Cold Stowage charter plane at the Long Beach Airport, placed into an insulated shipper with dry ice, and flown to Johnson Space Center (JSC). The KFTs were then transferred via FedEx ground to the Kennedy Space Center. The KFTs were removed from dry ice and transferred to a -80°C freezer. The PIs retrieved the plant samples from the KFTs and transferred the samples back to the University of Florida. The harvested material was used to compare the transcriptomes of each genotype. The patterns of gene expression and the genome-wide methylation profiles were compared between treatments (spaceflight versus ground control) and within each genotype.",

Here, we investigate how known terrestrial stress associated epigenetic modulations might play a role in spaceflight adaptation. To examine the role of 5mCyt in spaceflight adaptation, the APEX04-EPEX experiment conducted onboard the ISS evaluated the spaceflight altered genome wide methylation profiles of two methylation regulating gene mutants, methyltransferase 1 (met1-7) and elongator complex subunit 2 (elp2-5), that are involved in pathogen defense response, along with a wild type Col-0 control. MethylSeq and RNAseq analyses were performed on both spaceflight grown samples and ground grown controls. In addition, the epigenetics effects that may contribute to the differential gene expression patterns observed between leaf and root tissues were also investigated in an organ-specific manner.",

After completely thawing the samples to room temperature, the seedlings were observed under the microscope. The preserved seedlings from the spaceflight and ground control harvests were dissected into distinct plant parts: leaf, hypocotyl, and root. Total RNA extraction: Total RNA was extracted using Qiashredder and RNAeasy kits from QIAGEN (QIAGEN Sciences, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Residual DNA was removed by performing an on-column digestion using an RNase Free DNase (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Integrity of the RNA was evaluated using the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).     Basically, 2ul of of 1:200 diluted RNA spike-in ERCC (half amount of suggested in the ERCC user guide: Cat 4456740) spike to 1000 ng of total RNA followed by mRNA isolating using NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation module (New England Biolabs, catalog E7490).

Then followed by RNA library construction with NEBNext Ultra Directional Lib Prep (New England Biolabs, catalog  E7420) according to the manufacturer's user guide. Briefly, RNA is fragmented in NEBNext First Strand Synthesis Buffer by heating at 94 C for desired time. This step is followed by first strand cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase and oligodT primers. Synthesis of ds cDNA is performed using the 2nd strand master mix provided in the kit, followed by end-repair and adaptor ligation. At this point, Illumina adaptors are ligated to the sample. Finally, library is enriched (each library has a unique barcode) by 10 cycles of amplification, and purified by Agencourt AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter, catalog   A63881). 48 barcoded libraries were sized on the bioanalyzer, quantitated by QUBIT. Finally, 48 individual libraries were pooled with equimolar. The RNAseq libraries in the pool served to compensate for the low base diversity of bisulfite-converted genomic libraries. The final library was created by mixing RNA-seq vs bisulfite-converted libraries at a 60 percent:40 percent ratio, with a mere 1 percent PhiX spike-in. Library pools were processed according the Illumina protocol (HiSeq3000) for clustering on the cBOT machine.

The 48-sample project was sequenced on 12 lanes for a robust reads/lane output.\n\nGeneLab concatenated the submitted raw data files to be one forward and one reverse read for each sample     UMIs were extracted from fastq files using UMI-tools (version 1.1.2). Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Arabidopsis thaliana STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 54, genome version TAIR10 (Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.toplevel.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.54.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis thaliana + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), distance between forward and reverse reads using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.22.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. The data were normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only group B ERCC genes to estimate the size factor*. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the GeneLab Reference Annotations pipeline version GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.At.tair.db (version 3.15.0). *ERCC-normalized data are available upon request.     Dry, sterilized Arabidopsis seeds were planted aseptically on the surface of 10-cm2 solid media plates comprised of 0.5% Phytagel/0.5× MS media, and then immediately wrapped in light-tight black cloth (Duvetyne, SeattleFabrics.com) and transported to KSC (Kennedy Space Center), FL, USA. The wrapped plates were stored at temperatures between 4 and 10 C until launch within a cold stowage bag nominally at 4C. The seeds remained dormant until removed from cold stowage and exposed to light at the initiation of the experiment on the ISS (International Space Station). Plant growth on the ISS and ISSES: The plates were installed into the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) hardware on the ISS and a comparable set installed into the Veggie hardware on the ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Plants in the Veggie hardware were exposed to constant light conditions of 100-135 umoles/m2/s PAR. Stratification exposure calculated by GeneLab as the time seeds spent in 4C, moist conditions between launch and exposure to germination conditions. Mission launch (MM/DD/YYYY) was 02/19/2017 and growth time began on 02/25/2017.     At 11 days, seedlings were harvested by an astronaut into KFT (Kennedy Fixation Tube) containing RNAlater solutions. Once the plants were placed in the KFTs, the KFT was actuated with RNAlater to preserve the sample. At 24 hours post-harvest, KFTs were then transferred to MELFI freezer. Following Dragon Capsule splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, the KFTs transferred to the Cold Stowage charter plane at the Long Beach Airport, placed into an insulated shipper with dry ice, and flown to Johnson Space Center (JSC). The KFTs were then transferred via FedEx ground to the Kennedy Space Center. The KFTs were removed from dry ice and transferred to a -80 degrees C freezer. The PIs retrieved the plant samples from the KFTs and transferred the samples back to the University of Florida. The harvested material was used to compare the transcriptomes of each genotype. The patterns of gene expression and the genome-wide methylation profiles were compared between treatments (spaceflight versus ground control) and within each genotype.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "At the time of the experiment, seeds were dehusked, surface-sterilized with five successive 1-min washes with 95% (w/v) ethanol, and then air-dried in a sterile hood for at least 20 mins. 24 seeds per APEX Growth Chamber were inserted into the foam (6 per side), oriented with the embryo directed outward on the surface. Each accession was represented by a total of four APEX growth units (total of 96 seeds per accession). The seeded APEX Growth Units were packed in Cold Bags [5] held at 4°C and transferred to the Dragon capsule on SpaceX-14 where they were stored for 3 days before launch. SpaceX-14 launched on April 2nd 2018, and docked with the ISS ~2 days later. Twelve APEX growth units (4 per accession) were unpacked by astronaut Scott Tingle on April 12 2018, and the experiment was activated by injection of 90ml half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS: Sigma M5624 and MES: M2933) liquid medium into each APEX Growth Chamber through the injection port (Fig. 1). The APEX Growth Chambers were then integrated into the onboard VEGGIE growth unit fitted with Magenta-box holders following the pattern illustrated in Supplemental Figure S1 [6]. The red-LED lights were switched on to promote synchronized germination (low setting). After 24 h, the green and blue LED lights were also switched on (low setting) and the seedlings were allowed to grow for a period of 4 days under continuous light (blue, green and red LEDs at an intensity of approximately 40-55 µmol/m2/s). HOBO environmental sensors were placed into VEGGIE near the APEX Growth Chambers to capture the environmental conditions (temperature, humidity) during the entire growth period.\n\n Old protocol: Half-strength of Murashige and Skoog (MS) liquid medium were injected into the growth chamber at the time experiment initiated. Seedlings are then growing in Vegetable Production System (VEGGIE) hardware on ISS or ground control with 24 hours red light for synchronizing the germination. Then, seedlings were grown under green/blue/red light intensity around 40 to 55 umol/m2/s and 24 hours photo period for 4 additional days.     At the end of this growth period, seedlings were photographed with a Nikon D5 camera and then harvested into Kennedy Fixation Tubes (KFTs) preloaded with RNAlater (one KFT per APEX Growth Chamber). Tissue fixation was initiated by forcing RNAlater from the storage chamber of the KFTs into the fixation chamber containing harvested plant tissue. Fixation occurred at room temperature for a period of 24 h. The tubes were then stored in the Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer on the ISS (MELFI) for 20 days before being loaded onto the Dragon capsule and returned to Earth on May 5th 2018. The fixed samples were de-integrated from the KFTs and transferred into 50ml Falcon Tubes at KSC, then delivered frozen at -80°C to the Principle Investigator's laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for molecular analysis.     Bd21-3 and Gaz8: Plant tissues were homogenized while frozen. 1mL of TRIzol (Zymo Research, cat R2061) was added per each 50-100mG of tissue and the sample was vortexed. Homogenized sample was incubated at room temperature for 15mins. 200uL of chloroform was added to the homogenate and the sample was vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 3min. The samples were spun down for 15min at 8000 RPM and 4C for phase separation. The upper colorless aqueous phase was transferred into a new tube. 1 volume of 100% ethanol (Sigma, cat E7023) was added directly to one volume of sample and mixed well by inverting the tube. Whole volume was transferred immediately in to Direct-zol column (Zymo Research, cat R2061) and spun for 1 minute at top speed. On column RNase-free DNase I (Qiagen, cat 79254 ) treatment took place as following: 400uL of RNA Wash Buffer was added to the column and the column was centrifuged, flow through discarded. 80uL of DNase in RDD Buffer (10uL of DNase+70uL of Buffer RDD) was added in to the center of the column. The column with the DNase was incubated at room temperature for 15min. To wash away the DNase, 400uL Direct-zol RNA pre-wash solution was added to the column and the column was spun for 1min at top speed. The flow through was discarded and additional 700uL wash was preformed followed by 1min spin down at top speed. The flow trough was discarded. To elute the RNA, 50uL of DNase/RNase free water was added on to the column and the tubes were spun down for 1 min attop speed. The flow through containing the RNA was collected and transferred to a fresh tube. RNA concentration and quality was checked using Nanodrop 2000.\n\nBd21: Total RNA was extracted from the root or shoot tissues using Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Plus extraction kits (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA). DNAse-I treatment was performed in column using RNase-Free DNase-I Set (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). RNA quality was monitored using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and Eukaryotic total RNA NanoChip technologies (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA).”     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat #4456739, v92) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol.     Bd21-3 and Gaz8: RNA ribo depletion done with Illumina Ribo-Zero gold reagent (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN greater than 4.  Index adapters were 1.5 uM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters).  15 cycles PCR were performed.  Library fragment size ~300 bp was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).  Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit DNA HS kit. Library quality was determined by iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA), libraries were screened for rRNA and the pool was balanced.\n\nBd21: Approximately 1µg total RNA from each sample was used to generate cDNA libraries with rRNA reduction using TruSeq Stranded Total RNAlibrary Prep Plant Kits (lllumina, San Diego, CA).     Bd21-3 and Gaz8: RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Paired end 100bp. PhiX included as control at 1%.\n\nBd21: Paired-end sequencing (2x150bp) was performed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotech Center DNA sequencing Facility using NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina, USA). Libraries were multiplexed with a target of ~60 Million reads per sample for Bd21.     Seeds of three Brachypodium distachyon accessions (Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8) were obtained from Drs. Daniel Wood and Richard Amasino (University of Wisconsin-Madison). They were germinated and grown in soil (Berger Soil, BM2: Perlite: Vermiculite 2:1:1) side-by-side in the same growth chamber exposed to a constant temperature of 22°C, 65% relative humidity, 20 hours day / 4 hours night cycles and 100-120 micromole per square meter per second cool-white fluorescent light during the days. The plants were fertilized every other week with Blossom Booster Fertilizer (10-30-20). They were allowed to self-fertilize and generate seeds under these conditions. After harvesting, seeds were allowed to rest at room temperature for a minimum of three weeks to lift dormancy.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.     Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of B-distachyon rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.",

          "Study Description": "Most major cereal grain crops are monocots. Yet, most investigations of plant adaptation to the spaceflight environment have been carried out on the dicotyledonous model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. It remains unknown whether the conclusions from such studies can be extrapolated to monocotyledonous plants. To fill this knowledge gap, seedlings of three different accessions of Brachypodium distachyon (Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8), a model for temperate grasses including cereal crops, were grown on the International Space Station in the Veggie hardware and on the ground in matched conditions. To synchronize germination, seedlings were grown for 24 hours in red light. Then, seedlings were grown with green/blue/red light using a 24 hour photo period for 4 additional days. At this point, seedlings were harvested and placed in room temperature RNAlater for 24 hours before being moved to -80 C for storage and later dissection into roots and shoots. This dataset features ribodepleted RNA-seq data from the Bd21, Bd21-3 and Gaz8 accessions.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "For each experimental condition, 3-4 biological replicates, derived from roots fixed in a single KFT, were used. Excess RNALater was removed from roots, and RNA was extracted using the QIAshredder and RNAeasy kits from QIAGEN (QIAGEN Sciences, MD, USA), using the manufacturer's instructions. RNase-free DNase (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) was used for on-column digestion and removal of DNA.\n\nThe BO and VG RNA extracts were submitted for RNA-Seq analysis. The total RNA concentration was determined with a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY, USA), and RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The RINs of the total RNA used for RNA-Seq library construction were between 7.1 and 9.4.     Briefly, 1 ul of 1:2000 diluted RNA spike-in ERCC (half the amount suggested in the ERCC user guide) spike to 50 ng of total RNA followed by mRNA isolation using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation module (New England Biolabs, Catalog   E7490).     RNA-Seq libraries were constructed at the UF ICBR Gene Expression Core using the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Two ERCC controls were used for the experiment: ERCC Mix 1 was used for flight samples and ERCC 2 was used for ground control samples. Briefly, 1 ul of 1:2000 diluted RNA spike-in ERCC (half the amount suggested in the ERCC user guide) spike to 50 ng of total RNA followed by mRNA isolation using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation module (New England Biolabs, Catalog # E7490). RNA-Seq libraries were then constructed with the NEBNext Ultra Directional Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, catalog #E7420) according to the manufacturer's user guide. Briefly, RNA was fragmented in NEBNext First Strand Synthesis Buffer by heating at 94 C for the desired time. This step was followed by first strand cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) primers. Synthesis of double-stranded cDNA was performed using the 2nd strand master mix provided in the kit, followed by end-repair and Illumina adaptor ligation. Finally, the uniquely-barcoded libraries were enriched by 10 cycles of PCR amplification, and purified by Agencourt AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter, catalog # A63881). 24 barcoded libraries were sized on the Bioanalyzer, and quantitated via the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer. Finally, the 24 individual libraries were pooled equimolarly.     Illumina NovaSeq 6000     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Arabidopsis thaliana rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.3 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.3/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Arabidopsis Thaliana STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl Plants release 54, genome version TAIR10 (Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.toplevel.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.54.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis Thaliana + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. The data were normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor*. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.At.tair.db (version 3.15.0). Assessment regarding ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis.html report.\n\n*ERCC-normalized data are available upon request.     Petri dishes (100 mm x 15 mm; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), containing 50 mL of a 0.5% Phytagel-based growth medium supplemented with: 0.5x Murashige-Skoog salts, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose, and 1x Gamborg's Vitamin Mixture, were prepared aseptically for planting. Seeds were sterilized via treatment with 70% ethanol for 10 minutes, and then with 50% bleach supplemented with Tween-20 at 2-3 drops per mL for 20 minutes, with seeds being mixed throughout the process. Seeds were washed with sterile water at least 6 times, and stored at 4 C for 3-5 days. Seeds were dispensed onto the media surface in a laminar flow hood in one row of 12-15 seeds, and plates were sealed with Micropore tape (3M, Maplewood, MN, USA). Plates were maintained vertically in a growth room at 19 +/- 2 C, with 24-h fluorescent lighting at approximately 80 umol m-2 s-1 PAR, until the time of transport to the experimental location. At the VG site, plates were maintained in the ambient conditions of the payload facility, under an LED light bank. At the BO site, plates were maintained in the payload processing facility in a Danby herb cultivator at 26 C (Danby, Ontario, CA; Catalog   DFG17A1B). For each experiment, flight plates were wrapped in Duvetyne Black-Out Cloth (Seattle Fabrics) and this package was Velcro-mounted to the inner wall of the FLEX imaging payload as a piggyback payload.     The VG VP-03 flight launched on December 13th, 2018 from the Mojave Air and Spaceport in California. The VSS Unity detached from its mothership one hour after takeoff, to begin the suborbital portion of the flight. The one minute ascent was characterized by hyper-g which increased steadily to nearly 4.5g over 30 seconds, and then decreased. This was followed by three minutes of microgravity, and one minute of hyper-g on descent, increasing to around 3.5g and decreasing again. A glide of about nine minutes followed, containing a mixture of short hyper- and hypo-g spikes. The VSS Unity landed, and access was provided to the cabin for opening of the FLEX payload. The plates were removed and transported from the runway to a nearby vehicle with a harvest station set up in the rear bay.\n\nThe BO payload was transported to the launch pad, and loaded into the payload stack of the New Shepard capsule. The NS-12 mission launched at 12:53 PM EST on December 11th, 2019 from the BO West Texas Launch Site. The ascent took about two minutes, reaching a maximum of near 3g before engine cutoff. After a three minute window of microgravity was a one minute hyper-g portion of the descent, with a peak of 5.7g measured. The release of the capsules' drogue and primary parachutes generated short spikes between 3g and 3.5g, but otherwise this portion of the descent was around 1g, and lasted for four minutes. The FLEX payload was removed from the capsule after landing, and before capsule recovery operations. Plates were removed from the FLEX payload, and carried briefly to a nearby area set up for harvest. The 11-day-old seedlings were harvested and fixed in the same manner as in the VG experiment. The fixation was 33 minutes after landing, with an elapsed time of 43 minutes for the experiment. GC seedlings, which were maintained in the BO Payload Processing Facility during the flight , were removed from the Danby unit and harvested one hour after the FLT seedlings.     RNALater-fixed samples were removed from -80C storage, and thawed overnight at 4C. Seedlings were disentangled, and roots were dissected from shoots.",

          "Study Description": "The increasing availability of flights on suborbital rockets creates new avenues for the study of spaceflight effects on biological systems, in particular the transitions between hypergravity and microgravity. This paper presents an initial comparison of the responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to suborbital and atmospheric parabolic flights as an important step toward characterizing these emerging suborbital platforms and their effects on biology. Transcriptomic profiling of the response of the Arabidopsis ecotype Wassilewskija (WS) to the aggregate spaceflight experiences in the Blue Origin New Shepard and Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo rockets revealed that the transcriptomic load induced by flight differed greatly between the two flights, yet was biologically related to traditional parabolic flight responses. The sku5 skewing mutant and 14-3-3κ:GFP regulatory protein overexpression lines each showed altered intra-platform responses compared to WS in the Blue Origin and parabolic flights, respectively. An additional parabolic flight using the F-104 Starfighter showed that the response of 14-3-3κ:GFP to flight was modulated in a similar manner to the WS line. Despite the differing genotypes, experimental workflows, flight profiles and platforms, alteration of gene expression remodeling central metabolic processes was commonly observed as a response to the flights. The processes included carbon and nitrogen metabolism, branched-chain amino acid degradation, and hypoxic responses. The timing and directionality of differentially-expressed genes involved in the conserved pathways differed among the platforms. The data presented herein highlight the potential for various suborbital platforms to contribute insights into biological responses to spaceflight, and further suggest that in-flight fixation during suborbital experiments will provide insights into responses to each phase of flight. Multiple genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were flown on either the Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo (VG VP-03; Col-0 and WS) or Blue Origin New Shepard (BO NS-12; WS and sku5) suborbital flight platforms. Plates containing the seedlings, 10 days and 11 days old in VG and BO, respectively, were wrapped in Duvetyn Black-Out cloth and mounted to the internal wall of the FLEX imaging system payload used in these flights. Gene expression was compared between the ground control and spaceflight-exposed seedlings via RNA-Seq analysis of extracted total RNA from the roots of these seedlings",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana wild type (WT) ecotype Columbia (Col 0) were surface sterilized with 70% (v/v) ethanol (Sigma 270741) for 4 min, rinsed twice with 95% (v/v) ethanol for 1 min and dried in laminar flow cabin. Then, 28 selected seeds were affixed onto a sterile nitrocellulose membrane (VWR 28149-472) with 1% (w/v) Guar Gum (Sigma G-4129) and the membranes with seeds were affixed in turn on blotter paper (Whatman 17 CHR, Fisher Scientific 3017-915) previously soaked in 1/2 MS (Murashige and Skoog's, Duchefa) growth medium and placed on the cassette (culture chamber, CC) base. These samples belong to the ground reference control (1g) at nominal Earth gravity and to the larger spaceflight experiment (Seedling Growth 2 and 3, at the Mars (0.3g) or ISS (0g) g levels). The seedlings grew in the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) of the European Space Agency (ESA) at Trondheim, Norway or the ISS model. The EMCS was an incubator able to hydrate the seeds and control atmospheric conditions as humidity, O2, CO2 and ethylene levels, also providing videorecording and image capture facilities. Standard EMCS Experiment Containers (ECs) need to be complemented with an Experiment Unique Equipment (EUE) providing specific experimental requirements. In our case, we used the 'Tropi' EUE, developed by NASA, consisting of culture chambers (CC), or cassettes, providing semiautomatic hydration and a lighting system with white, red and blue LEDs. Each EC could accommodate five 'Tropi' cassettes. Ground control began with the hydration of the cassettes, and the seedlings grew for 6 days at 22C and in a controlled atmosphere. The first 4 days (96 h) of growth all seedlings were illuminated with a photoperiod regime (16 h white light/8h darkness) (30-40 umol/m2s).     During the experiment, seedlings were grown for four days in a long day photoperiod (16 h white light, 30–40 umol/m2s and 8 h darkness) at two nominal g-levels on board the ISS (microgravity and Mars gravity level nominally 0.3 g (0.34 ± 0.05 g), as provided by the EMCS centrifuge) and the Ground Reference Run 1g control. In the last two days of the timeline of the experiment, a change in the light conditions was introduced, half of the material was photostimulated with red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on one lateral of the ECs, and the rest of the material was grown in darkness. Red Light Treatment: Seedlings were illuminated under white light for 96 hours, followed by 48 hours of unidirectional photostimulation with RED light. Dark Treatment: Seedlings were illuminated under white light for 96 hours, followed by 48 hours of light deprivation (DARKNESS).     After the growth period in the Ground Model, the seedlings were collected from the cassettes and frozen in tubes with RNAlater (Ambion AM7020) at -80C. Once frozen (stable state), they were transported to Madrid (Spain) for processing. For the Spaceflight samples frozen at -80C was provided after the experimental run and estabilization with RNAlater was used when recovered on Earth to allow further conservation until processing.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. SG2 was sent to the International Space Station (ISS) during the SpaceX CRS-4 (September 2014) and returned on CRS-5 (February 2015), and SG3 was sent to the ISS during the SpaceX CRS-11 campaign (June 2017) and returned a month later, on the same mission. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.  Seeds were dormant at launch, then germinated and grown for six days, then harvested and frozen. Absorbed radiation dose and dose rate reported are from the germination to harvest.     Total RNA was extracted independently in three replicates (pooling 8-10 seedlings) per each experimental condition using a commercial kit and following manufacturer's instructions (MACHEREY-NAGEL, 740949.250). This kit includes one digestion step with DNAse for 15 min at room temperature. The quantity and quality RNA was measured in Bioanalyzer 2100 expert_Plant_RNA nano with Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies#5067-1511). RNA Integrity Number were above 7.     Seventeen total RNA samples (representing six experimental conditions with three biological replicates each except one of the spaceflight experiment sample) were used to generate seventeen sequencing libraries using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, USA). Samples were individually indexed. The samples then were combined at equimolar proportions (theoretical) into a first pool. This pool was sequenced providing a sets of fastq files for each library, then a second pool was prepared attending to the total count number to compensate deviations in the equimolar proportions and sequenced for a total of at least 25 million single-end reads per sample (when the two pools are combined).     The samples were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer from Genomics Unit at the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG core facilities, Spain) with stranded RNA read type and 50bp read length. Single-end sequencing was performed using one of two library pools and the total number of reads were assessed, then the second library pool was subsequently sequenced to reach the 25 million reads per sample objective.     Raw fastq files for each sample were concatenated (or merged) together to create one raw fastq file per sample. The merged raw fastq file from each sample was assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and merged raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate raw MultiQC reports. Data from merged raw fastq files through RSEM counts were processed as described in GL-DPPD-E (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-E.md). Raw RSEM count data generated with GL-DPPD-7101-E, were re-processed through normalization and DGE analysis as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md).In short, merged raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate trimmed MultiQC reports. Arabidopsis thaliana STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl plants release 48, genome version TAIR10 (Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.toplevel.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.48.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis thaliana STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.1.2) with tximport (version 1.22.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.At.tair.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Description": "The response of plants to the spaceflight environment and microgravity is still not well understood, although there has been an increased emphasis on this topic. Even less is known about plants' response to partial or reduced gravity levels. In the absence of the directional cues provided by the gravity vector, the plant is especially perceptive to other cues such as light. Here, we investigate the response of Arabidopsis thaliana 6-day-old seedlings to microgravity and the Mars partial gravity level during spaceflight, as well as the effects of red light photostimulation by determining meristematic cell growth and proliferation. These experiments involve microscopic techniques together with transcriptomic studies. We demonstrate that microgravity and partial gravity trigger differential responses. The microgravity environment activates hormonal routes responsible for proliferation/growth and upregulates plastid/mitochondrial-encoded transcripts, even in the dark. In contrast, the Mars gravity level inhibits these routes and activates responses to stress factors to restore cell growth parameters only when red photostimulation is provided. This response is accompanied by upregulation of numerous transcription factors such as the environmental acclimation-related WRKY family. In the long term, these discoveries can be applied in the design of bioregenerative life support systems and space farming.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Samples of flight and ground control experiments were preserved in RNAlater in situ and kept at -80C. The Petri dishes were removed from packaging and thawed in groups of three to prevent excess exposure to room temperature during sample collection. After removing most of the RNAlater from the plates, sterile forceps were used to transfer seed- lings from the plates to microcentrifuge tubes containing two glass beads. Seedlings were then frozen in liquid nitrogen. This procedure was carried out quickly to maximize RNA recovery. Accordingly, only some pictures were taken of plates before extraction for example purposes. Most pictures were taken after the bulk of the sample was removed, with the remaining seedlings also imaged for post hoc inspection. All plates were free from any visible evidence of bacterial or fungal contamination. Frozen samples were ground to a powder with a Retsch Mixer Mill (Retsch, Haan, Germany). RNA was extracted from tissues by using a NucleoSpin RNA Plant Kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer's instructions including DNase digestion. The overall quality and RNA integrity number (RIN) of RNA samples were assessed with Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).     RNA-seq libraries were constructed using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).     Sequence was done in single-end mode on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform (50-nt) at Research Technology Support Facility Genomics Core at Michigan State University.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.3) screened against a fasta file of Arabidopsis thaliana rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.3 (GitHub link coming soon). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Arabidopsis thaliana STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl Plants release 54, genome version TAIR10 (Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.toplevel.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.54.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis thaliana STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.22.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.At.tair.db (version 3.15.0).     Arabidopsis thaliana seeds of the following genotypes were used for flight and ground controls: WT (Col-0 ecotype), atire1, bzip60, bzip28, and bzip28 bzip60. Petri dishes (60 mm) were prepared with 6.7 mL of sterile ½ Murashige and Skoog media supplemented with Gamborg's B5 Vitamins (PhytoTechnology Laboratories), 0.5% sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.4% Phytagel (Sigma-Aldrich), pH adjusted to 5.7. In a sterile hood, seeds of WT and UPR-mutant genotypes were surface sterilized with one wash of 70% ethanol, one wash of 50% bleach containing 0.5% Tween 20, and then nine additional washes with sterile H2O distilled twice. After the final wash was removed, seeds were resuspended in 1.5 mL sterile water for wet plating by using a 1 mL pipette equipped with sterile filter tip. For each experimental unit (flight and ground control), five plate replicates of WT and bzip28/bzip60 genotypes and four plate replicates of atire1, bzip28, and bzip60 genotypes were prepared. Each plate replicate contained 70–80 seeds evenly spaced in a grid pattern on the plate surface. The Petri dishes were sealed with Parafilm (Heathrow Scientific), and individual plates were then wrapped twice with sterile aluminum foil. Individually wrapped plates were grouped by BRIC configuration and wrapped together with two more layers of sterile aluminum foil before sample removal from the sterile hood. Plates were placed at 4°C until the integration of samples into science hardware the following morning. This flight experiment utilized 4 Biological Research In a Canister (BRIC) containing a total of 22 Petri Dish Fixation Unit (PDFU) hardware (Wells et al., 2001) to cultivate sterile dark-grown seedlings germinated aboard the ISS for a 14 day period. An identical set of samples was prepared and grown on Earth with a 2-day offset at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) ISS Environmental Simulator to allow for data transmission and reproduction of incubation conditions experienced by flight samples in orbit. HOBO data loggers equipped with temperature sensors were integrated into two of the four BRICs to record temperatures experienced by samples during the experiment for post hoc analysis. Launch samples (i.e., Arabidopsis seeds) were integrated into BRIC flight hardware in a sterile hood ∼48 h before the August 14, 2017, launch of SpaceX CRS12 spacecraft. Integrated science/hardware was kept at 4°C to maintain seed dormancy before packing in cold storage bags while being loaded onto Dragon capsule and during launch.     This experiment utilized 4 Biological Research In a Canister (BRIC) containing a total of 22 Petri Dish Fixation Unit (PDFU) hardware to cultivate sterile dark grown seedlings germinated aboard the International Space Station (ISS) for a 14 day period. PDFU actuation chambers were loaded with tissue fixative (RNAlater; Invitrogen) to preserve samples at the conclusion of the experiment. An identical set of samples was prepared and grown on earth with a two-day offset at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES) to allow for data transmission and reproduction of incubation conditions experienced by flight samples in orbit. Petri dishes (60mm) were prepared with 6.7 ml of sterile 1/2 MS media supplemented with Gamborg's B5 Vitamins, 0.5% Sucrose, 0.4% Phytagel, pH adjusted to 5.7. In a sterile hood, seeds of wild-type and UPR mutant genotypes were surface sterilized with one wash of 70% ethanol, one wash of 50% bleach containing 0.5% Tween 20, and then nine additional washes with sterile double distilled H2O. After the final wash was removed, seeds were resuspended in 1.5 ml sterile water for wet plating using a 1 ml pipette equipped with sterile filter-tips. Each plate replicate contained 70-80 seeds evenly spaced in a grid pattern on the plate surface. Petri dish lids were closed by Parafilm wrap and individual plates were then double wrapped in sterile aluminum foil. Individually wrapped plates were grouped by BRIC configuration and wrapped together with two more layers of sterile foil prior to sample removal from the sterile hood. Plates were placed at 4C until integration of samples into science hardware the following morning. Launch samples (i.e., seeds) were integrated into BRIC flight hardware in a sterile hood approximately 48 hours before the August 14th, 2017 launch of SpaceX-CRS12 spacecraft. Integrated science/hardware was kept at 4C to maintain seed dormancy prior to packing in cold storage bags while being loaded onto Dragon capsule and during launch. After docking, samples were removed from cold storage bags by ISS astronauts, warmed to ambient ISS temperature, allowing seed germination and experiment initiation in the BRIC. After 14 days ISS astronauts actuated PDFUs, which were then incubated at room temperature for a further 3 hours.     PDFU actuation chambers were loaded with a tissue fixative (RNAlater; Invitrogen) to preserve samples at the conclusion of the flight experiment. After treatment before samples were transferred to the ISS -80 MELFI freezer. Samples were kept at approximately -80C until BRICs were conditioned to -32C in double cold bag storage and stowed in the Dragon capsule before undocking and atmospheric reentry on September 16th. After returning to KSC, samples were stored at -80C until de-integration of the flight and ground samples.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped.

          "Study Description": "Plants are primary producers of food and oxygen on Earth and will likewise be indispensable to the establishment of large-scale sustainable ecosystems and human survival in space. To contribute to the understanding of how plants respond to spaceflight stresses, we examined the relevance of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a conserved signaling cascade that responds to a number of unfavorable environmental stresses, in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. To do so, we compared the transcriptional responses of wild type and UPR-defective seedlings to spaceflight during the SpaceX-CRS12 mission to the International Space Station. We established that orbital culture substantially altered the expression of hundreds of stress related genes compared to ground control conditions. Although many of these genes were differentially regulated in the UPR mutants in the ground control conditions compared to wild type, their expression was largely equalized in all genotypes by flight. Our results have yielded new information on how plants respond to growth in orbit and support the hypothesis that spaceflight induces the activation of signaling pathways that compensate for the loss of UPR regulators in the control of downstream transcriptional regulatory networks.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Landsberg erecta (Ler) were flown to the ISS via the SpaceX Dragon. Spaceflight experiments were conducted utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) in the Columbus Module of the ISS. The EMCS facility provides two centrifuges for creation of simulated gravity vectors, as well as atmospheric, temperature and hydration monitoring and control. In addition, the EMCS contains a video camera for image acquisition as well as monitoring of growth. The Seedling Growth series of experiments was conducted in three parts. Seedlings from SG1 and SG2 experiments were used here. The first set of seedlings were uploaded on SpaceX CRS-2 (March 2013) followed by return via CRS-3 (May 2014), and the second set of seedlings were carried to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-4 (September 2014) and returned on CRS-5 (February 2015). Experimental containers were uploaded to the ISS and loaded into the EMCS as previously described. Experimental conditions were controlled remotely from the Norwegian User Support and Operations Centre (N-USOC; Trondheim, Norway). The experiment was initiated via hydration of the seeds.     Plants were grown under 6 nominal gravity conditions produced by different rotational speeds on the EMCS centrifuge, microgravity (stopped EMCS centrifuge), 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8g and 1.0g. The angular speed to generate each nominal fractional gravity level was calculated for the cassette in the center of the Experimental Container. In the case of the 1.0g cassettes, the value was calculated for the fifth cassette in order to prevent values higher than Earth nominal gravity. Seedlings were illuminated under white light (30-40 micromoles per meter squared per second) for 96 h, followed by 48 hours of unidirectional photostimulation with blue light. Some samples were exposed to a short red light treatment also (but the main illumination stimuli is still blue light). Light sources were LEDs. Light Treatment 1: Seedlings were illuminated under white light (30-40 micromoles per square meter per second) for 96 h, followed by 48 hours of unidirectional photostimulation with blue light. Light sources were LEDs. Light Treatment 2: Seedlings were illuminated under white light (30-40 micromole per square meter per second) for 96 h, followed by 48 hours of unidirectional photostimulation with blue light and exposed to a short red light treatment also (but the main illumination stimuli is still blue light. Light sources were LEDs. Light Treatment 3: Seedlings were illuminated under white light (30-40 micromole per square meter per second) for 96 h, followed by 48 hours of unidirectional photostimulation with blue light. Light sources were LEDs. Light Treatment 4: Seedlings were illuminated under white light (30-40micromole per square meter per second) for 96 h, followed by 48 hours of unidirectional photostimulation with blue light and exposed to a short red light treatment also (but the main illumination stimuli is still blue light. Light sources were LEDs     After conclusion of the experiments, seedlings were frozen in dedicated holders by placing them at -80C in the General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator (GLACIER) freezer of the ISS. Upon return of frozen seedlings to Earth, samples were transported on dry ice and immediately preserved with RNALater for subsequent RNA-Seq analysis.

Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module.

Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation. The first set of seedlings (SG1) were uploaded on SpaceX CRS-2 (March 2013) and returned on CRS-3 (May 2014), and the second set of seedlings (SG2) were carried to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-4 (September 2014) and returned on CRS-5 (February 2015). Dates from R. Herranz (priv. comm.).   The total mission duration of SG1 was ~443 days and SG2 was ~147 days. Seeds were dormant at launch, then germinated and grown for six days, then harvested and frozen. Absorbed radiation dose and dose rate reported are from the germination to harvest. Absorbed radiation dose (from launch to sample harvest) is also included.     A plant specific RNA extraction NucleoSpin kit (MACHEREYNAGEL, Catalog # 740949.250) including a DNase treatment was used to isolate whole plant mRNA. The quantity and quality of the extracted RNA was determined by Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific). Extracted RNA was kept frozen at -80C.     ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA Cat # 4456739, v92) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added immediately after RNA extractions at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol.     RNA ribo-depletion was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Plant. Input RNA were approximately <100 - 500 ng with A260/ A280 greater than 1.8, A260/ A230 greater than 1. Index adapters were 1.5 uM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size ~279 bp was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured by Universal qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control was determined by iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).     RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Paired end 149bp. PhiX included as control.     UMIs were extracted from fastq files using UMI-tools (version 1.1.2). Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Arabidopsis thaliana STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl Plants release 54, genome version TAIR10 (Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.toplevel.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.54.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis thaliana + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), distance between forward and reverse reads using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data was imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. The data were normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor*. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.At.tair.db (version 3.15.0). Assessment of ERCC spiked genes was performed as detailed in the ERCC_analysis.html report. *ERCC-normalized data are available upon request.",

Here, we present results from the Seedling Growth space experiments on the ISS, to complement the previously released GLDS-251 dataset including seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana wildtype plants. Seeds were germinated, and seedlings grew for six days under different gravity levels, namely micro-g, several intermediate partial-g levels, and 1g, and were subjected to irradiation with blue light for the last 48 hours.

          "Study Protocol Description": "Total RNA was extracted from dry or CAAT seeds for each of Earth-WS, Earth, and Space seed batches, three replicates per treatment, as outlined previously. Its quality was verified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100.          RNA libraries of the 18 samples were sequenced using a HiSeq V4 sequencer (Illumina) generating paired-end 125 bp reads (Vienna BioCenter Core Facilities GmbH, Austria).     Seed Material, Space Travel and Packaging: Seeds of salad rocket, Eruca sativa Mill. (TZ 5007 seed lot 09835147, Tozer Seeds Ltd. Pyports, Downside Bridge Road, Cobham, Surrey, KT11 3EH, UK) were used in the Rocket Science project. Company warehouse storage of this seed lot was at 14C with a relative humidity (RH) of 25% in foil bags. Three seed batches originating from this seed lot were used in our experimental work: (1) The seed batch ‘Earth-WS (Warehouse Stock)’ was directly taken from this seed lot stored in the described warehouse conditions (14C, 25% RH). The Earth-WS seed batch therefore provides a ground control which remained in the warehouse storage and therefore directly represents the original seed lot (no space journey, no packaging process). (2) The seed batch ‘Earth’ also provides a ground control, but in addition to the several-month warehouse storage (~22C, 25% RH) it also underwent the packaging process in March 2016. In this packaging process, individual foil packets (red) were filled with 100 seeds each (Seed Packers Ltd., Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, IP32 6NL, UK). (3) The seed batch ‘Space’ underwent the space journey and subsequently the same packaging process in March 2016 to provide individual foil packets (blue). During the entire space journey, seed were transported and stored in sealed foil bags with a humidity of 25% inside a jiffy envelope. While Space seeds underwent the space journey (plus packaging), Earth-WS (no packaging) and Earth (plus packaging) remained in warehouse storage. Packaging of the Space and Earth seeds was conducted under the same conditions and with the same foil bags (red and blue) in the second half of March 2016.\n\nFor the space journey, Space seed were transported in the sealed foil bags by airplane from London (UK) to Baikonur (Kazakhstan) via Noordwijk (Netherlands) and Moscow (Russia) in August 2015. The transport was at room temperature (18–25C), but as no temperature datalogger was used, we cannot exclude occasional fluctuations beyond this temperature range. Space seeds were launched aboard Soyuz 44S (air temperature on board 18–25C) to the ISS on 2nd September 2015. Space seeds were stored for six months inside the ISS (with an average temperature of 22 to 23C and occasional fluctuations between 18 and 32C), and the location within the space station changed; the seeds were stored most of the time in the Columbus laboratory and occasionally were removed for photographs (still sealed within foil bags). Space seeds boarded the Soyuz capsule on 2nd March 2016 for re-entry to Earth, landing on the Kazakh Steppe. Seeds were transported to London (UK) by airplane via Moscow (Russia), Stavanger (Norway), and Houston (USA) and underwent the packaging process in the UK starting 14 March 2016. The sealed foil bag during the space journey was to maintain humidity (low), air composition, and pressure throughout. Moisture content was determined by drying 100 mg of seed in glass vials using a drying oven for 17 h at 103C and reweighing. Dry storage of the seeds in red and blue foil bags in the Seed Science Laboratory at Royal Holloway University of London was at 22C in a sealed plastic container above silica gel (generating <15% RH). Conductivity assays were conducted in May 2016, CAAT assays took place January–April 2017, and RNA extraction for the transcriptome analysis was in May 2017.     Controlled Artificial Ageing Treatment (CAAT): Seeds were transferred to 2 mL Eppendorf tubes and exposed to 70% RH (in the headspace of a sealed container above 25 g/100 mL LiCl) for three days at 22C and then exposed to 35C for the specified number of days (length of CAAT). Seeds were then dried above silica beads at 35C for 2 h and subsequently stored in sealed vials at room temperature until germination assays were carried out. CAAT is a commonly used method in seed science and industry to compare the ageing sensitivity of seeds during dry storage. To achieve this in an experimentally reasonable time, the combination of increased temperature (usually to 35–45C) and RH (usually 70–90% to generate an elevated seed moisture content) is required.",

          "Study Description": "In the 'Rocket Science' citizen science project Eruca sativa (salad rocket) seeds stored for six months on board of the International Space Station caused delayed crop establishment. Here we investigated the physiological and molecular mechanisms underpinning the spaceflight effects on dry seeds. We found that 'Space' seed germination vigor was reduced and aging sensitivity increased, but the spaceflight did not compromise seed viability and the development of normal seedlings. Comparative analysis of the transcriptomes (using RNASeq) in dry seeds and upon controlled artificial aging treatment (CAAT) revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with spaceflight and ageing. DEG categories enriched by spaceflight and CAAT included transcription and translation with reduced transcript abundances for 40S and 60S ribosomal subunit genes. Among the 'spaceflight-up' DEGs were Heat Shock Protein (HSP), DNAJ-related chaperones, a Heat Shock Factor (HSFA7a-like), and components of several DNA repair pathways (e.g. ATM, DNA ligase1). The 'response to radiation' category was especially enriched in 'spaceflight-up' DEGs including HSPs, catalases and the transcription factor HY5. The major finding from the physiological and transcriptome analysis is that spaceflight causes vigor loss and partial ageing during air-dry seed storage, for which space environmental factors and consequences for seed storage during spaceflights are discussed.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "The laboratory preparations and launch conditions: Dry, sterilized Arabidopsis seeds were planted aseptically on the surface of 10-cm2 solid media plates comprised of 0.5% Phytagel/0.5× MS media, and then immediately wrapped in light-tight black cloth (Duvetyne, SeattleFabrics.com) and transported to KSC (Kennedy Space Center), FL, USA. The wrapped plates were stored at temperatures between 4 and 10 °C until launch within a cold stowage bag nominally at 4 °C. The seeds remained dormant until removed from cold stowage and exposed to light at the initiation of the experiment on the ISS (International Space Station). Plant growth on the ISS and ISSES: The APEX03-2 experiment plates were grown in the Vegetable Production System (VPS/Veggie) hardware on the Columbus Module of the ISS. The 10-cm2 Petri plates were housed perpendicular (“vertical”) to the overhead LED lighting of the VPS. Plants received between 100–135 μmoles/m2/s PAR inside the VPS. Four and eight days after germination was initiated by unwrapping the plates and exposing them to light in the VPS. The ground control plates were grown inside the VPS ground unit within the ISSES (International Space Station Environment Simulator) chamber at KSC with the 48-h delay. The ISSES chamber replicated the temperature, CO2 levels and lighting that had been experienced by the spaceflight plants in the previous 48 h.     On Orbit Operations and harvest: At four or for the second experimental set at eight days, seedlings were harvested by an astronaut into KFT (Kennedy Fixation Tube) containing RNAlater solutions. Once the plants were placed in the KFTs, the KFT was actuated with RNAlater to preserve the sample. At 24 hours post-harvest, KFTs were then transferred to MELFI freezer. Following Dragon Capsule splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, the KFTs transferred to the Cold Stowage charter plane at the Long Beach Airport, placed into an insulated shipper with dry ice, and flown to Johnson Space Center (JSC). The KFTs were then transferred via FedEx ground to the Kennedy Space Center. The KFTs were removed from dry ice and transferred to a -80°C freezer. The PIs retrieved the plant samples from the KFTs and transferred the samples back to the University of Florida. The harvested material was used to compare the transcriptomes of each genotype. The patterns of gene expression was compared between treatments (spaceflight versus ground control) within each genotype of same age or between two ages within same genotype and within same treatment.     Seedlings stored in RNAlater were recovered from -80°C freezer. Each tube containing the seedlings was allowed to thaw in the fridge overnight. After completely thawing the samples to room temperature, the seedlings were observed under the microscope. Roots of the preserved seedlings from the spaceflight and ground control harvests were dissected and the rest of the seedlings were saved in RNAlater and stored back to -80°C freezer. For 4 day old roots 5-8 roots were combined to serve as one biological replica. For 8 day old roots 2-3 roots were used to form one biological replica. In each case the four biological replicas were used for the transcriptomic analysis.     Seedlings stored in RNAlater were recovered from -80°C freezer. Each tube containing the seedlings was allowed to thaw in the fridge overnight. After completely thawing the samples to room temperature, the seedlings were observed under the microscope. Roots of the preserved seedlings from the spaceflight and ground control harvests were dissected and the rest of the seedlings were saved in RNAlater and stored back to -80°C freezer. For 4 day old roots 5-8 roots were combined to serve as one biological replica. For 8 day old roots 2-3 roots were used to form one biological replica. In each case the four biological replicas were used for the transcriptomic analysis. Total RNA extraction: Total RNA was extracted using Qiashredder and RNAeasy™ kits from QIAGEN (QIAGEN Sciences, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Residual DNA was removed by performing an on-column digestion using an RNase Free DNase (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Integrity of the RNA was evaluated using the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).     RNASeq libraries preparation using SMART-Seq V4 ultra low input RNA kit for sequencing combined with Illumina Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit. Five ng of total RNA was used for each cDNA library construction using the CloneTech SMART-Seq V4 ultra low input RNA kit for sequencing (Clontech Laboratories, Inc, cat : 634890) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, first strand cDNA was primed by the SMART-Seq v4 oligonucleotide and then base-pairs with these additional nucleotides, creating an extended template. The reverse transcriptase then switched templates and continued transcribing to the end of the oligonucleotide, resulting in full-length cDNA that contains an anchor sequence, which served as a universal priming site for second strand synthesis. cDNA was amplified with primer II A for 9 PCR cycles. Then Illumina sequencing libraries were generated with 120 pg of cDNA using Illumina Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Cat : FC-131-1024) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 120 pg of cDNA was used as input for the Nextera tagmentation reaction (fragmentation and tagging) and then adapter sequences added onto template cDNA by PCR amplification. Libraries were quantitated by Bioanalyzer and qPCR (Kapa Biosystems, catalog number: KK4824). Finally, the libraries were pooled equal molar concentration and sequenced by Illumina 2X75 NextSeq 500.     Sequencing experiments were performed at the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) gene expression and sequencing core, University of Florida. In preparation for sequencing, barcoded libraries were sized on the bioanalyzer, quantitated by QUBIT and qPCR (Kapa Biosystems, catalog number: KK4824). Individual samples were pooled equimolarly at 4 nM. This “working pool” was used as input in the NextSeq500 instrument sample preparation protocol (Illumina, Part # 15048776, Rev A). Typically, a 1.3 pM library concentration resulted in optimum clustering density in our instrument (i.e., ~200,000 clusters per mm2). Samples were sequenced on 5 flowcells (5 NextSeq 500 runs), using a 2x75 cycles (paired-end) configuration. A typical sequencing run in the NextSeq500 produced 750-800 million paired-end read with a Q30>=85%. For RNA seq, around 40 million reads provided sufficient depth for transcriptome analysis.     Merged raw reads files were generated using sratools (version 2.11.0) to fetch associated SRA files for each sample and extract raw reads and finally concatenate into forward and reverse raw reads files. Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Arabidopsis thaliana rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.4/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Arabidopsis thaliana STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl Plants release 54, genome version TAIR10 (Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.toplevel.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.54.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis thaliana STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.At.tair.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Description": "The wild type WS plants and the Sku5 mutant plants in the WS background were germinated on ISS or on the ground and the gene expression profiles in roots at 4 days or 8 days were established. The Sku5 gene (AT4G12420) codes for a multi-copper oxidase-like protein SKU5 protein that is involved in directed root tip growth. The Sku5 protein is glycosylated, GPI-anchored and localizes to the plasma membrane and the cell wall. The Sku5 gene is expressed most strongly in expanding tissues. The development of WS and Sku5 plants on orbit differs from that on the ground as demonstrated by the comparison of the gene expression profiles between 4 days old to 8 days old plant in the two environments. However the development of Sku5 mutant plants also differs from WS at either age and in either environment, suggesting the role of the genetic background in these developmental decisions. The 4 days old Sku5 roots in orbit engaged substantially more genes than the 4 days old WS roots in orbit but also more than the 4 days old Sku5 roots on the ground. Overall the 4 days old roots differentially expressed more genes in spaceflight relative to ground than the 8 days old roots of either genotype. Finally, the 4 days old Sku5 roots in orbit differ in 862 genes from the 8 days Sku5 roots in orbit while on the ground there is merely half of the number of genes differentially expressed between the 4 days and 8 days developmental stages of the Sku5 roots. APEX03-2 (Advanced Plant Experiment 03-2) also identified as TAGES-Isa (Transgenic Arabidopsis Gene Expression System—Intracellular Signaling Architecture) was launched on SpaceX mission CRS-5 on 10 January 2015. Dry, sterilized Arabidopsis seeds were planted aseptically on the surface of 10-cm2 solid media plates and remained dormant until removed from cold stowage and exposed to light at the initiation of the experiment on the ISS (International Space Station).

The first set of seedlings were uploaded on SpaceX CRS-2 (March 2013) followed by return via CRS-3 (May 2014), and the second set of seedlings were carried to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-4 (September 2014) and returned on CRS-5 (February 2015).  Experimental containers were uploaded to the ISS and loaded into the EMCS as previously described (Kiss et al., 2014;Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016;Vandenbrink et al., 2019). Experimental conditions were controlled remotely from the Norwegian User Support and Operations Centre (N-USOC; Trondheim, Norway).  The experiment was initiated via hydration of the seeds.  Plants were grown under 6 nominal gravity conditions produced by different rotational speeds on the EMCS centrifuge, microgravity (stopped EMCS centrifuge), 0.1-g, 0.3-g, 0.5-g, 0.8-g and 1.0-g. The angular speed to generate each fractional gravity level was calculated for the cassette in the center of the Experimental Container. In the case of the 1.0-g cassettes, the value was calculated for the fifth cassette in order to prevent values higher than Earth nominal gravity.     RNA was extracted individually for each EC TROPI cassette for most of the samples (i.e. from 24 cassettes, 20 samples were obtained to collect approximately 10-15 seedlings per extraction). A plant specific RNA extraction NucleoSpin kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL, Catalog # 740949.250) including a DNase treatment was used to isolate whole plant mRNA. The quantity and quality of the extracted RNA was determined by Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific). Extracted RNA was keep frozen at -80C until shipped on dry ice to the David H. Murdoch Research Institute in Kannapolis; North Carolina, USA.      Twenty total RNA samples were used to generate twenty sequencing libraries using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, USA). Samples were individually indexed.     The samples then were combined at equimolar proportions into three pools with 6-7 samples per pool. Each pool was loaded onto a single lane of a flow cell. A 125bp paired end sequencing run was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2500.     Paired-end 125bp reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis TAIR10 genomes using the HISAT2 pipeline on the Clemson University Palmetto Cluster (Kim et al., 2015).  Fragments with a Phred score below 33 were filtered using Trimmomatic (Trimmomatic, 2013).  HISAT2 (v2.1.0) was used to align sequencing reads.  Reads were assembled into transcripts using StringTie (v1.3.4). Annotation was conducted using TAIR10 FASTA sequence the TAIR10 genome GTF annotation file (https://www.arabidopsis.org).      Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Arabidopsis thaliana STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 44, genome version TAIR10 (Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.toplevel.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.44.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis thaliana STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads from 3 samples were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.0.3) with tximport (version 1.18.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.30.0). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.30.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.2.0), PANTHER.db (v1.0.10), and org.At.tair.db (v3.12.0).     Seedlings were illuminated under white light (30-40 umol m-2 s-1) for 96 h, followed by 48 hours of unidirectional photostimulation with blue light. Light sources were LEDs. Spaceflight experiments were conducted utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) in the Columbus Module of the ISS.  The EMCS facility provides two centrifuges for creation of simulated gravity vectors, as well as atmospheric, temperature and hydration monitoring and control.     After conclusion of the experiments, seedlings were frozen in dedicated holders by placing them at -80C in the General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator (GLACIER) freezer of the ISS. Upon return of frozen seedlings to Earth, samples were transported on dry ice and immediately preserved with RNALater for subsequent RNA-Seq analysis.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module.  Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account.\n\nThe measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei).\n\nBoth active and passive dosimeters are used.  Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification.  Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground.\n\nThe dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload.\n\nFor plant studies the experiment duration begins at the time of onset of conditions that allow for seed germination. Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped.  Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://www.nasa.gov/reference/osdr-environmental-data/.\n\nThe first set of seedlings (SG1) were uploaded on SpaceX CRS-2 (March 2013) and returned on CRS-3 (May 2014), and the second set of seedlings (SG2)  were carried to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-4 (September 2014) and returned on CRS-5 (February 2015). Dates from R. Herranz (priv. comm.). The total mission duration of SG1 was ~443 days and SG2 was ~147 days. Seeds were dormant at launch, then germinated and grown for six days, then harvested and frozen. Absorbed radiation dose and dose rate reported are from the germination to harvest. Absorbed radiation dose (from launch to sample harvest) is also included.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Arabidopsis seeds, wild type (Col-0) and transgenic line over expressing type I InsP 5-ptase were sterilized and mounted on gridded membranes (presoaked in MS media and dried).  Onboard the ISS, ECs were loaded into the EMCS by the attending astronaut. The experiment was initiated by remotely controlled hydration. The seeds stayed dormant until the experiment was initiated by hydration once inserted into the EMCS chamber.  Seedlings were grown for 5 days under continuous white light (LEDs).  The temperature in seed cassettes was ~ 24C.  O2 levels ~ 21%.  CO2 levels ramped up from ~ 200- 800 ppm over the course of the 5 day experiment.  Images were acquired every 6 hours. NOTE: The EMCS chamber has 2 rotors, allowing for the 1G control to be carried out in space at the same time as the microgravity exposure. For each experimental run, one rotor was set to 1g and second rotor held stationary (micro g). The 1g controls carried out in space were located in the cassette position 3 of the rotor, which actually corresponds to 0.76g. Additionally, there were 2 back to back runs in the EMCS (for a total of 2 replicate experiments). Flight samples were launched on Shuttle mission STS-135 and returned on SpaceX Dragon Cargo Resupply CRS-2.     At the end of the experiment, seed cassettes were removed from the ECs and frozen immediately in the onboard -80C freezer (MELFI). Seed cassettes remained frozen onboard the ISS. Samples were maintained at freezing temperatures during return via Space-X Dragon, after splashdown and until delivery to the laboratory. Samples were then stored at -80C until processing for RNA     RNA was isolated from sample using the RNAqueous Micro kit (Ambion, Waltham, MA, USA). RNA recovery and integrity was monitored by Bioanalyzer. Typical RNA integrity number (RIN) exceeded 9.5.     Library preparation and sequencing was carried out by the Genomic Sciences Laboratory at North Carolina State University. PolyA RNA was captured using the NEBNext Poly (A) mRNA magnetic isolation module and libraries were prepared using the ultra-directional library kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA).     Sequencing was carried out on 3 lanes of Illumina HiSeq2500 (125 bp single end reads).     The original raw sequence files for samples: F03, F08, F13, F18, F23, F28, F33, F38, F43, F48, F53, F58, F63, F68, F73, F78, GC01, GC13, GC14, GC16 contained duplicate headers. To ensure all read headers were unique, awk (version 5.0.1) was used on all fastq files containing duplicate headers to relabel each read with a unique header while preserving original read sequences, quality and order. Raw fastq files from each sample were then assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Arabidopsis thaliana rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on Sept-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.3 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.3/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Arabidopsis thaliana STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl Plants release 54, genome version TAIR10 (Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.toplevel.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.54.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis thaliana STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.2) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) to generate the RSEM_Unnormalized_Counts.csv table.",

The objective of our spaceflight experiment “Plant Signaling in Microgravity” (carried out on the International Space Station, ISS), was to compare transcript profiles of wild type and transgenic InsP 5-ptase plants with compromised InsP3 signaling. The transgenic Arabidopsis plants constitutively express the mammalian type I inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (InsP 5-ptase), an enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes the lipid-derived second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3). These transgenic plants exhibit normal growth and morphology; however, their responses to environmental stimuli including gravity and drought are altered. Seedlings were grown for 5 days under continuous light in experimental containers placed in the European Modular Cultivation system (EMCS) onboard the ISS. The EMCS consists of two rotors within a controlled chamber, allowing for a “1g” control in space. After sample retrieval from the ISS, RNA was isolated from shoot and root tissue and subjected to RNA sequencing. Two-way comparisons of micro g versus “1”g have uncovered regulatory mechanisms that are both conserved and altered between the wild type and transgenic seedlings.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Genomic-wide bisulfite sequencing was performed using a similar procedure as described by Wang et al. (2013) with several modifications. In summary, genomic DNA was extracted from leaves and roots of spaceflight and ground control samples using a modified phenol/chloroform extraction method (LeFrois et al. 2016). Between 700-1700 ng of genomic DNA was processed for sequencing library construction. The average size of the genomic DNA for this type of samples was 5 Kb as observed on a DNA12000 BioAnalyzer chip (Agilent). DNA was transferred into 6x16 mm glass microtubes with AFA fiber and pre-slit snap caps (Cat# 520045, Covaris, Inc.). As it is required by the Illumina sequencing procedure, the DNA was sheared into average fragments size of ~400 bp, using the Covaris S220 ultrasonic disruptor, and following the recommended settings by the manufacturer. Short DNA fragments (<100 bp) were removed using AMPure magnetic beads (Cat# A63881, Beckman Coulter) at a 1:1 bead to sample ratio. At this point we obtained a yield of 300-750 ng of clean, fragmented DNA. Between 100-250 ng of this material was used for Illumina sequencing library construction using the NEBnext Ultra DNA Illumina construction kit (Cat# E7370S, NEB) in conjunction with Illumina-specific methylated and barcoded adaptors (Cat# E7535S, NEB) from the same source. This particular library construction kit was chosen because it contains reagents that have been optimized for relatively low-input DNA in the library construction process. At the end of the end-repair, 3'-adenylation, and adaptor-ligation steps, 75-150 ng of clean, adaptor-ligated DNA fragments (Illumina library) were recovered in Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. It should be noted that the libraries were not PCR-amplified at this stage, as it would normally be done in the most typical Illumina library construction protocol. Libraries were quantitated using a QUBIT fluorometer (Life Technologies).Illumina libraries (containing methylated adaptors) were subjected to sodium bisulfite treatment using the EZ DNA Methylation Direct kit (ZYMO Research, Cat #D5020) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting libraries were enriched by a 13-15 cycle amplification using an uracil-insensitive polymerase (EpiMark hot start Taq polymerase, NEB, Cat#M0490S). The amplified library products were separated on a 2% agarose gel from which library fragments in the 250-500 bp range were excised (QIAquick gel extraction kit, Cat# 28704, QIAGEN) and AMPure purified (Cat# A63881, Beckman Coulter). Gel staining was done with SYBR safe (Life Technologies) and visualized on a blue light transilluminator (Life Technologies) in order to avoid UV damage of DNA. The final libraries were quantitated by the QUBIT fluorometer, and by qPCR with the Kapa SYBR Fast qPCR reagents (Cat# KK4824, Kapa Biosystems) with monitoring on an ABI7900HT real-time PCR system (LifeTechnologies). The average library size was 350 bp. In preparation for sequencing on the HiSeq3000 Illumina sequencer, barcoded libraries were normalized to 2.5 nM and pooled (equimolarly). Up to 6 samples were pooled for sequencing on a single HiSeq3000 flow cell lane, using a 2x101 cycle multiplex, paired-end configuration. Typically, the PhiX library is used for a spike-in (at 20%) in order to correct for the low base diversity of bisulfite-converted genomic libraries. Alternatively, bisulfite-converted libraries were sequenced alongside RNA-seq libraries (60%:40% ratio of RNA-seq vs Bisulfite-converted libraries), without a PhiX spike-in. Library pools were processed according the Illumina protocol (HiSeq3000) for clustering on the cBOT machine. The final pool concentration for clustering was 0.25 nM, following denaturation, neutralization, and mixing with the ExAmp reagent.     DNA was extracted using a modified phenol/chloroform protocol as previously described [105], as residual components from the RNAlater preservation interfered with spin-column based gDNA kits. The quality and quantity were determined using a DNA1200 BioAnalyzer chip (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Three biological replicates of root and leaf samples from spaceflight and ground controls were used for both RNA-seq and WGBS.This DNA material was then submitted to the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology at the University of Florida for bisulfite conversion and Next-Generation sequencing. Genome_build: Arabidopsis thaliana WS reference genome (Mott et al. Nature 2011)     Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing was performed similarly to previous experiments [106]. In brief, 700 to 1000_ng of genomic DNA was processed for sequencing library construction. The DNA was transferred into 6 by 16 mm glass microtubes with AFA fiber and pre-slit snap caps and sheared into average fragments of around 200 bp using the Covaris S2 ultrasonic disruptor, following the manufacturer settings. Fragments of less than 100 bp in size were removed using AMPure magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) at a 1:1 bead to sample ratio and 300 to 750ng of clean, fragmented DNA was obtained. Between 100 and 250ng of this material was used for Illumina sequencing library construction using the NEBnext Ultra DNA Illumina construction kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) in conjunction with Illumina-specific methylated and barcoded adaptors (New England Biolabs). After end-repair, 3 adenylation, and adaptor-ligation steps, 75 to 150ng of clean, adaptor-ligated DNA fragments (Illumina library) were size-selected to 250 to 500_bp (average 320bp) using AMpure beads and recovered in Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 with quantification using a QUBIT fluorimeter (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Likewise, libraries were bisulfite converted using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer instructions.      The fastq files containing short reads from whole-genome bisulfite sequencing were trimmed to remove low-quality bases using trimmomatic (version 0.36). Fastq files before and after trimming were analyzed for quality control with FastQC (version 0.11.4). The fraction of reads removed because of low quality was never more than 0.01%.  Total number of reads after trimming for each sample ranged from 22,446,135 to 39,065,215. A second filtering step was performed to remove reads showing evidence of incomplete conversion, using the cscall tool (http://compbio.ufl.edu/software/cscall/). The fraction of reads removed in this step ranged between 0.05% and 0.08%. The remaining reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis genome using bsmap (http://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-10-232) version 2.87. The percentage of aligned reads ranged from 87.57% and 90.52%. Methylation calling was performed with cscall using the ws_0.v7.allPlusChlMito-CG index. A site was included in the analysis if it reached a coverage of 20 in at least 2 out of the three replicates of each sample. Differential methylation was determined using the mcomp program, part of the MOABS suite (https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2014-15-2-r38), version 1.3.4. Sites for which the P-value of the difference between test and control methylation rates was below 0.01 were considered significant. Sites with a methylation difference above 0.3 were classified as Strongly hyper/hypo methylated(++ or  --), otherwise they were classified as hyper/hypo methylated (+ or -). Genome_build: Arabidopsis thaliana WS reference genome (Mott et al. Nature 2011)     Dry, sterilized Arabidopsis seeds of wild-type cultivar Wassilewskija were planted aseptically on the surface of 10 cm2 solid media plates comprised of 0.5% Phytagel/0.5 MS media, and then immediately wrapped in light-tight black cloth (Duvetyne, SeattleFabrics.com) and transported to KSC (Kennedy Space Center), FL, USA. This WS Arabidopsis seed line has been propagated in the Ferl laboratory for about 25_years; the WS line is curated as ABRC stock CS915 (www.arabidopsis.org).The wrapped plates were stored at temperatures between 4 and 10C and remained dormant until removal from cold stowage and exposure to light at the initiation of the APEX03-2 experiment on the ISS (International Space Station). Plates were integrated and grown in the Vegetable Production System (VPS/Veggie) hardware on the Columbus Module of the ISS. The 10 cm2 Petri plates were housed perpendicular (vertical) to the overhead LED lighting of the VPS. Plants received between 100to 135 micromoles/m^2/s PAR inside the VPS. The plants were grown for eleven days after germination, which was initiated by unwrapping the plates and exposing them to light in the VPS. The ground control plates were grown inside the VPS ground unit within the ISSES (International Space Station Environment Simulator) chamber at KSC with a 48-h delay. The ISSES chamber replicated the temperature, CO2 levels and lighting that had been experienced by the spaceflight plants in the previous 48h.      The two treatments involved in this experiment were spaceflight and ground control. Spaceflight plants were grown for 11 days aboard the ISS in the VEGGIE hardware. Ground control plants were grown for 11 days in the VEGGIE hardware in the ISSES chamber at KSC, which replicates the temperature, CO2 levels and lighting that had been experienced by the spaceflight plants in the previous 48h.     Individual plates were subsequently removed from Veggie and harvested by astronaut CDR Butch Wilmore into Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Fixation Tubes (KFTs) and fixed in RNAlater (Ambion, Grand Island, NY, USA). KFTs provide three levels of liquid containment and are quintessential ISS hardware for studying many aspects molecular biology. One plate of plants was harvested to an individual KFT. The three KFTs were then stowed at 80C in the MELFI freezer aboard the ISS, and remained frozen during the return to Earth for de-integration at KSC. The frozen samples were transferred from KFTs to 50_mL falcon tubes, and remained frozen until delivery to the Principal Investigators for analysis.     RNA extraction was performed using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturers guidelines RNA concentration was determined on Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher/Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY), RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). Three biological replicates of root and leaf samples from spaceflight and ground controls were used for both RNA-seq and WGBS.     RNAseq libraries were constructed using NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, USA) for poly(A) mRNA isolation following manufacturers recommendations.     Twelve barcoded bisulfite-seq libraries and 12 barcoded RNA-seq libraries (with triplicates for each condition) were pooled with the ratio of RNA: DNA is 60%: 40% and sequenced on three flow cell lanes on the HiSeq3000 instrument using a 2 x 101 cycle multiplex paired-end reads per lane.     The quality of the RNA-Seq sequence data was first evaluated using FastQC prior to further downstream analysis. Low quality sequences were removed and poor quality part of the reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic. The Star Aligner was used to map high quality paired-end reads to TAIR10 genome. Gene expression was obtained using RSEM [109]. The expected read counts and Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM), were extracted for further analysis. A generalized linear regression model was built to perform the differential gene analysis using edgeR [110]. The criteria that Counts per Million mapped reads (CPM) above 5 in at least 3 samples out of all RNA libraries was used to gate genes with extremely low expression.     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Arabidopsis thaliana STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 44, genome version TAIR10 (Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.toplevel.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.44.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis thaliana STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads from 3 samples were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.0.3) with tximport (version 1.18.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.30.0). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.30.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.2.0), PANTHER.db (v1.0.10), and org.At.tair.db (v3.12.0).",

The High Altitude Student Platform (HASP) program out of Louisiana State University offered the opportunity to develop and fly an initial balloon payload as an undergraduate project preliminary to the work described here and was funded in part by the NASA Florida Space Grant Consortium (NNX15_011). The NASA Balloon Payload Office (BPO) out of Goddard Space Flight Center created the opportunity to fly CRESS as a piggyback payload in Antarctica. The entire BPO administration and especially flight development and operations crews were exceedingly accommodating and helpful throughout the payload design and implementation process. The BACCUS team created the entire Antarctic balloon mission and graciously accommodated our piggyback payload. Dr. Howard Levine of Kennedy Space Center was instrumental in enabling and supporting the connections between Space Biology and the use of NASA balloons through a non-reimbursable NASA Space Act Agreement KCA-4572-1. Dr. Ye Zhang of Kennedy Space Center together with Dr. Levine and Dr. Megumi Hada (PI of the primary beam time) of Prairie View A&M University created the opportunity to expose CRESS seeds at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) as a piggyback experiment on an NSRL grant awarded to Dr. Zhang again using Space Act Agreement KCA-4572-1. The National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs particularly Dr. Nature McGinn guided the CRESS payload through the processes of permitting biological samples in Antarctica. The Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) at the University of Florida conducted the DNA sequencing. Dr. David Moraga and Dr. Yanping Zhang from ICBR guided the application and design of the PacBio sequencing approach used in these preliminary analyses.

Samples were ground in 500 mL lysis buffer (100 mM EDTA 50 mM EGTA 50 mM Tris-Cl ph 7.5) 1  xb5L RNase A (100 mg/mL) and 55.6  xb5L 10% SDS. Samples were then incubated overnight at 55  xb0C with 44.4  xb5L Proteinase K (25 mg/mL). The following day 1/3 volume of 5M Potassium Acetate (KOAc) was added and the samples were placed on ice for 30-60 minutes before being spun down at 4  xb0C for 5 minutes. The supernatant was then transfered to a new tube spun an additional time and transferred once more to a new tube. Isopropanol (0.7 vol) was added and the solution set at room temperature for 30 minutes. Then after a 10 minute centrifugation the supernatant was decanted. The pellet was dried and resuspended in 50  xb5L TE. 20  xb5L 7.5 M Ammonium Acetate (AmOAc) and 150  xb5L 95% EtOH were added and the tube was mixed by inversion. The samples were set at -20  xb0C for 2 hours and centrifuged at 4  xb0C for 10 minutes. The supernatant was decanted and the pellet washed three times with 70% EtOH.

          "Study Description": "The Cosmic Ray Exposure Sequencing Science (CRESS) payload system is a proof of concept experiment to assess the genomic impact of space radiation on seeds. CRESS was designed as a secondary payload for the December 2016 high-altitude high-latitude and long-duration balloon flight carrying the Boron And Carbon Cosmic Rays in the Upper Stratosphere (BACCUS) experimental hardware. Investigation of the biological effects of Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR) particularly those of ions with High-Z and Energy (HZE) is of interest due to the genomic damage this type of radiation inflicts. The biological effects of upper-stratospheric mixed radiation above Antarctica (ANT) were sampled using Arabidopsis thaliana seeds and were compared to those resulting from a controlled simulation of GCR at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and to laboratory control seed. The payload developed for Antarctica exposure was broadly designed to 1U CubeSat specifications (10cmx10cmx10cm <1.33kg) maintained 1 atm internal pressure and carried an internal cargo of four seed trays (about 580,000 seeds) and twelve CR-39 Solid-State Nuclear Track Detectors (SSNTDs). The irradiated seeds were recovered sterilized and grown on Petri plates for phenotypic screening. BNL and ANT M0 seeds showed significantly reduced germination rates and elevated somatic mutation rates when compared to non-irradiated controls with the BNL mutation rate also being significantly higher than that of ANT. Genomic DNA from mutants of interest was evaluated with whole-genome sequencing using PacBio SMRT technology. Sequence data revealed the presence of an array of genome structural variants in the genomes of M0 and M1 mutant plants.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Total cellular RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN).     cDNA was synthesized using Ovation Pico WTA System (NuGEN Technologies Inc.) and cDNA was labeled using Encore Biotin Module (NuGEN Technologies Inc.)     Amplified and labeled cDNA (5 ug/sample) was fragmented and hybridized with rotation onto Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays for 16h at 45 C. Arrays were washed on a Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) with the Hybridization Wash and Stain Kit (Affymetrix) and the Washing Procedure FS450_0004.     Scan was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.     The MAS5 data was generated by using the Affymetrix Expression Console software using default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.3 (GitHub link coming soon).  In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.2). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using oligo (version 1.58.0). Raw data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). The raw probe level intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the oligo (version 1.58.0) quantile method. Normalized probe level data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0).  Normalized probe level data was summarized to the probeset level using the oligo (version 1.58.0) RMA method. Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probeset using the Plants Ensembl database ftp server (plants.ensembl.org, release 54). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probeset to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned for every probeset that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.At.tair.db (version 3.15.0).     Two Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 cell culture lines were used: Wild Type (WT) and ARG1 KO SALK_024542C line (ARG1 T-DNA insertion knockout), all cell cultures derived from hypocotyls. Tissue culture cells were plated on 60mm round, nutrient agar Petri plates cultured in a horizontal position until turnover and installation into the BRIC hardware. All of the sub-culturing on the plates was conducted in the laboratory of the PIs and the University of Florida. Plates were planted in a laminar flow hood and stored in sterile Biotransfer Boxes (BT). Plates with cells were kept in the dark and at ambient temperature. After pouring, the plates were allowed to solidify, and then transferred to a sterile Biotransporter (to maintain sterility of external surface) until planting. The liquid media from a sterile cell suspension was decanted, and the cells were washed once with fresh liquid media, and then decanted again. A sterile scoop was used to place about 1 gram of cells in the surface on the plate and disperse evenly across the surface. The cover was replaced, but not taped, and transferred to a sterile BT. The BT was wrapped in black cloth and stored at room temperature. The same day plates were transported by car to the Kennedy Space Center, NASA for the same night (3:00 AM) Turn Over. The ground control plates were turned over 48 hours later. The hardware for this experiment was the NASA BRIC-LED (Biological Research In a Canister - Light Emitting Diode). The LED component of the hardware was disabled and all biology was held in the dark for the duration of the experiment. The BRIC-LED canisters hold six 60 mm diameter Petri plates in small sub-compartments called PDFUs (Petri Dish Fixation Units). The PDFUs allow an externally activated fixation step without manipulating the samples. An additional set of Petri plates within BRIC hardware, identical to that launched for Spaceflight, was prepared for the Ground Control. The Ground Control was housed in the OES (Orbital Environmental Simulator) chamber in the Spaceflight Life Sciences Laboratory (SLSL) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The Ground Control was initiated with a precise 24 hour delay to enable the OES environment to be programmed with the environmental profile taken from telemetry of the Space Shuttle. Nominally, the Ground Control BRIC hardware and samples experienced the same external environment profile as the hardware and samples on the Space Shuttle. Environmental parameters that were controlled on the OES and made identical to flight are cabin temperature, humidity and CO2 concentration.     The BRIC-17 experiment was turned over to payload engineers in the SLSL at KSC 48 hours before the scheduled launch time. The payload launched on Dragon cargo spacecraft, SpaceX-2 on March 1st, 2013, at 10:10 EST, and achieved orbit approximately twelve minutes later. Dragon berthed to the ISS on the March 3rd, 2013.     The biology was in orbit 10 days before being fixed on orbit with RNAlater. The Dragon unmanned spacecraft unberthed the ISS and splashed into Pacific on the March 26th and the biology was returned to the Kennedy Space Center and handed to the PIs at SLSL on the April the 2nd.",

          "Study Description": "The Heat Shock Factor A2 (HsfA2), as a part of the HSF network, is essential to the plant's response to almost any environmental stress and to the cellular homeostatic control mechanisms. Plant cell cultures disabled in HsfA2 function were grown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in order to ascertain whether or not they use the same terrestrially effective systems to adapt to the novel environment of spaceflight. Cultured lines of Arabidopsis thaliana derived from wild type (WT) cultivar Col-0 and from a knock-out line deficient in the gene encoding HSFA2 (HSFA2 KO) were launched to the ISS on SpaceX-2 as part of the Cellular Expression Logic (CEL) experiment of the BRIC17 spaceflight mission and were fixed in-flight after 10 days on orbit. Microarray gene expression data were analyzed using a two-part comparative approach. First, differentially expressed genes were identified between the environments (spaceflight to ground) within cells of the same genotype, which represented physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment. Second, gene expression profiles were identified between the genotypes (HSFA2 KO to WT) within the same environment, defining genes uniquely required by the two genotypes in the ground and spaceflight adapted states. The physiological state of the cells as a result of disabling a gene has tremendous control over the mechanisms induced to adapt to the environment of spaceflight. The HsfA2 demonstrated a role in the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment since the cells disabled in the HsfA2 gene used substantially different genes to achieve the spaceflight adapted state than the WT cells. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) define the HSFA2 KO cells' physiological state regardless of the environment and likely result from the deficiency in the chaperone-mediated protein folding machinery. HsfA2 seems to have a universal stress response role but also specific roles in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight through cell wall remodeling, signal perception and transduction and starch biosynthesis. Implementation of knock-out cells identified a set of genes with a required expression level in order for a cell to achieve a spaceflight-adapted state. The HSFA2 KO cells helped to unravel the HsfA2-dependent genes of the adaption of wild type cells to the environment of spaceflight.",

After stratification, the Petri dishes containing the seeds were placed in a culture room with an ambient temperature of 22 ± 1 C and 16 h light at 8000 lx. After germination and growth for 3 days in the Petri dishes, 49 seedlings were transferred to individual culture chambers in cultivation unit 1 and precultivated for 3 days until launch.     The seedlings continued to grow for up to 60 h under microgravity conditions.     These seedlings were fixed with RNAlater (Ambion, Foster City, CA, USA) under microgravity at 60 h of spaceflight. After the chemically fixed seedlings were returned to the ground, 49 seedlings in a culture chamber were transferred to a Falcon tube containing RNAlater as a single sample. Three independent samples prepared in this manner were used for further DNA methylome analysis. The samples were preserved and stored at −80 °C before further processing for DNA isolation.     Total genomic DNA was isolated from Arabidopsis seedlings according to a previous protocol. Using a sonicator, 5mg of genomic DNA was fragmented to a DNA length of approximately 200 bp. The DNA fragments\nwere then treated three times using the Qiagen 59104 EpiTect Bisulfite Kit. Lambda DNA was used to determine the bisulfite conversion rate.

          "Study Protocol Description": "The laboratory preparations and launch conditions: Dry, sterilized Arabidopsis seeds were planted aseptically on the surface of 10-cm2 solid media plates comprised of 0.5% Phytagel/0.5× MS media, and then immediately wrapped in light-tight black cloth (Duvetyne, SeattleFabrics.com) and transported to KSC (Kennedy Space Center), FL, USA. The wrapped plates were stored at temperatures between 4 and 10 C until launch within a cold stowage bag nominally at 4 C. The seeds remained dormant until removed from cold stowage and exposed to light at the initiation of the experiment on the ISS (International Space Station). Plant growth on the ISS and ISSES: The APEX03-2 experiment plates were grown in the Vegetable Production System (VPS/Veggie) hardware on the Columbus Module of the ISS. The 10-cm2 Petri plates were housed perpendicular ('vertical') to the overhead LED lighting of the VPS. Plants received between 100–135 μmoles/m2/s PAR inside the VPS. Four and eight days after germination was initiated by unwrapping the plates and exposing them to light in the VPS. The ground control plates were grown inside the VPS ground unit within the ISSES (International Space Station Environment Simulator) chamber at KSC with the 48-h delay. The ISSES chamber replicated the temperature, CO2 levels and lighting that had been experienced by the spaceflight plants in the previous 48 h.     On Orbit Operations and harvest: At four or for the second experimental set at eight days, seedlings were harvested by an astronaut into KFT (Kennedy Fixation Tube) containing RNAlater solutions. Once the plants were placed in the KFTs, the KFT was actuated with RNAlater to preserve the sample. At 24 hours post-harvest, KFTs were then transferred to MELFI freezer. Following Dragon Capsule splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, the KFTs transferred to the Cold Stowage charter plane at the Long Beach Airport, placed into an insulated shipper with dry ice, and flown to Johnson Space Center (JSC). The KFTs were then transferred via FedEx ground to the Kennedy Space Center. The KFTs were removed from dry ice and transferred to a -80C freezer. The PIs retrieved the plant samples from the KFTs and transferred the samples back to the University of Florida. The harvested material was used to compare the transcriptomes of each genotype. The patterns of gene expression was compared between treatments (spaceflight versus ground control) within each genotype of same age or between two ages within same genotype and within same treatment.     Sample preparation for transcriptomics:Seedlings stored in RNAlater were recovered from -80°C freezer. Each tube containing the seedlings was allowed to thaw in the fridge overnight. After completely thawing the samples to room temperature, the seedlings were observed under the microscope. Roots of the preserved seedlings from the spaceflight and ground control harvests were dissected and the rest of the seedlings were saved in RNAlater and stored back to -80°C freezer.For 4 day old roots 5-8 roots were combined to serve as one biological replica. For 8 day old roots 2-3 roots were used to form one biological replica. In each case the four biological replicas were used for the transcriptomic analysis. Total RNA extraction: Total RNA was extracted using Qiashredder and RNAeasy™ kits from QIAGEN (QIAGEN Sciences, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Residual DNA was removed by performing an on-column digestion using an RNase Free DNase (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Integrity of the RNA was evaluated using the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).     Library preparation: RNASeq Libraries Preparation using SMART-Seq V4 ultra low input RNA kit for sequencing combined with Illumina Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit Ten ng of total RNA was used for cDNA library construction using CloneTech SMART-Seq V4 ultra low input RNA kit for sequencing (Clontech Laboratories, Inc, cat : 634890) according to manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 1st strand cDNA was primed by the SMART-Seq v4 oligonucleotide and then base-pairs with these additional nucleotides, creating an extended template. The reverse transcriptase then switches templates and continues transcribing to the end of the oligonucleotide, resulting full-length cDNA that contains an anchor sequence that serves as a universal priming site for second strand synthesis. cDNA was amplified with primer II A for 8 PCR cycles. Then Illumina sequencing libraries were generated with 150 pg of cDNA using Illumina Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Cat : FC-131-1024) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 150 pg of cDNA was fragmented by tagementation reaction and then adapter sequences added onto template cDNA by PCR amplification. Libraries were quantitated by Bioanalyzer and qPCR (Kapa Biosystems, catalog number: KK4824). Finally, the libraries were pooled equal molar concentration and sequenced by Illumina 2X75 NextSeq 500.     Illumina sequencing:Sequencing experiments were performed at the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) gene expression and sequencing core, University of Florida. In preparation for sequencing, barcoded libraries were sized on the bioanalyzer, quantitated by QUBIT and qPCR (Kapa Biosystems, catalog number: KK4824). Individual samples were pooled equimolarly at 4 nM. This working pool was used as input in the NextSeq500 instrument sample preparation protocol (Illumina, Part # 15048776, Rev A). Typically, a 1.3 pM library concentration resulted in optimum clustering density in our instrument (i.e., ~200,000 clusters per mm2). Samples were sequenced on 5 flowcells (5 NextSeq 500 runs), using a 2x75 cycles (paired-end) configuration. A typical sequencing run in the NextSeq500 produced 750-800 million paired-end read with a Q30>=85%. For RNA seq, around 40 million reads provided sufficient depth for transcriptome analysis.     The data analysis was performed at the ICBR bioinformatics core, University of Florida. Input fastq files were trimmed to remove the adapters and low-quality bases using trimmomatic (version 0.36) with the following parameters: LEADING:3, TRAILING:3, SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15, MINLEN:50. Quality control on the trimmed reads was performed using FastQC version 0.11.2. Reads were aligned to the Col-0 TAIR10 genome using the STAR aligner (version 2.5.1b), and duplicate reads due to PCR artifacts were removed using the Picard MarkDuplicates tool. In total, 502 million reads were aligned to the transcriptome.\nExpression quantification and differential gene expression analysis were performed using cufflinks and cuffdiff respectively (version 2.2.1) with default parameters. The cuffdiff output files were parsed with custom scripts to generate the final annotated tables of differentially expressed genes.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.3) screened against a fasta file of Arabidopsis thaliana rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on Sept-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.3 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.3/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Arabidopsis thaliana STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl Plants release 54, genome version TAIR10 (Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.toplevel.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.54.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis thaliana STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none (unstranded) and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.At.tair.db (version 3.15.0).",

The Sku6 gene (At2g03680) codes for a protein that localizes to microtubule within the cortical array and putatively acting as an intramolecular linker. The development of Col-0 and Sku-6 plants on orbit differs from that on the ground as demonstrated by the comparison of the gene expression profiles between 4 days old to 8 days old plant in the two environments. However the development of Sku-6 mutant plants also differs from Col-0 at either age and in either environment, suggesting the role of the genetic background in these developmental decisions. The 4 days old Sku-6 roots in orbit engaged more genes than the 4 days old Col-0 roots in orbit but also more than the 4 days old Sku-6 roots on the ground. Overall the 4 days old roots differentially expressed more genes in spaceflight relative to ground than the 8 days old roots of either genotype.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Dry, sterilized Arabidopsis seeds were planted aseptically on the surface of 10-cm2 solid media plates comprised of 0.5% Phytagel/0.5% MS media, and then immediately wrapped in light-tight black cloth (Duvetyne, SeattleFabrics.com) and transported to KSC (Kennedy Space Center), FL, USA. The wrapped plates were stored at temperatures between 4 and 10C until launch within a cold stowage bag nominally at 4C. The seeds remained dormant until removed from cold storage and exposed to light at the initiation of the experiment on the ISS (International Space Station). Plant growth on the ISS and ISSES (International Space Station Environment Simulator): The APEX03-2 experiment plates were grown in the Vegetable Production System (VPS/Veggie) hardware on the Columbus Module of the ISS. The 10-cm2 Petri plates were housed perpendicular (vertical) to the overhead LED lighting of the VPS. Plants received between 100-135umoles/m2/s PAR inside the VPS. Four and eight days after germination was initiated by unwrapping the plates and exposing them to light in the VPS. The ground control plates were grown inside the VPS ground unit within the ISSES (ISS Environmental Simulator) chamber at KSC with the 48-h delay. The ISSES chamber replicated the temperature, CO2 levels and lighting that had been experienced by the spaceflight plants in the previous 48h.     On Orbit Operations and harvest: At four or for the second experimental set at eight days, seedlings were harvested by an astronaut into KFT (Kennedy Fixation Tube) containing RNAlater solutions. Once the plants were placed in the KFTs, the KFT was actuated with RNAlater to preserve the sample. At 24 hours post-harvest, KFTs were then transferred to MELFI freezer. Following Dragon Capsule splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, the KFTs transferred to the Cold Stowage charter plane at the Long Beach Airport, placed into an insulated shipper with dry ice, and flown to Johnson Space Center (JSC). The KFTs were then transferred via FedEx ground to the Kennedy Space Center. The KFTs were removed from dry ice and transferred to a -80C freezer. The PIs retrieved the plant samples from the KFTs and transferred the samples back to the University of Florida. The harvested material was used to compare the transcriptomes of each genotype. The patterns of gene expression was compared between treatments (spaceflight versus ground control) within each genotype of same age or between two ages within same genotype and within same treatment. Seedlings stored in RNAlater were recovered from -80C freezer. Each tube containing the seedlings was allowed to thaw in the fridge overnight. After completely thawing the samples to room temperature, the seedlings were observed under the microscope. Roots of the preserved seedlings from the spaceflight and ground control harvests were dissected and the rest of the seedlings were saved in RNAlater and stored back to -80C freezer. For 4 day old roots 5-8 roots were combined to serve as one biological replica. For 8 day old roots 2-3 roots were used to form one biological replica. In each case the four biological replicas were used for the transcriptomic analysis.     Total RNA was extracted using Qiashredder and RNAeasy kits from QIAGEN (QIAGEN Sciences, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Residual DNA was removed by performing an on-column digestion using an RNase Free DNase (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Integrity of the RNA was evaluated using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).     Ten ng of total RNA was used for cDNA library construction using CloneTech SMART-Seq V4 ultra low input RNA kit for sequencing (Clontech Laboratories, Inc, cat : 634890) according to manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 1st strand cDNA was primed by the SMART-Seq v4 oligonucleotide and then base-pairs with these additional nucleotides, creating an extended template. The reverse transcriptase then switches templates and continues transcribing to the end of the oligonucleotide, resulting full-length cDNA that contains an anchor sequence that serves as a universal priming site for second strand synthesis. cDNA was amplified with primer II A for 8 PCR cycles. Then Illumina sequencing libraries were generated with 150 pg of cDNA using Illumina Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Cat : FC-131-1024) according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 150 pg of cDNA was fragmented by tagementation reaction and then adapter sequences added onto template cDNA by PCR amplification. Libraries were quantitated by Bioanalyzer and qPCR (Kapa Biosystems, catalog number: KK4824). Finally, the libraries were pooled equal molar concentration and sequenced by Illumina 2X75 NextSeq 500.     Sequencing experiments were performed at the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) gene expression and sequencing core, University of Florida. In preparation for sequencing, barcoded libraries were sized on the bioanalyzer, quantitated by QUBIT and qPCR (Kapa Biosystems, catalog number: KK4824). Individual samples were pooled equimolarly at 4 nM. This working pool was used as input in the NextSeq500 instrument sample preparation protocol (Illumina, Part   15048776, Rev A). Typically, a 1.3 pM library concentration resulted in optimum clustering density in our instrument (i.e., ~200,000 clusters per mm2). Samples were sequenced on 5 flowcells (5 NextSeq 500 runs), using a 2x75 cycles (paired-end) configuration. A typical sequencing run in the NextSeq500 produced 750-800 million paired-end read with a Q30 greater or equal to 85%. For RNA seq, around 40 million reads provided sufficient depth for transcriptome analysis.     Merged raw reads files were generated using sratools (version 2.11.0) to fetch associated SRA files for each sample and extract raw reads and finally concatenate into forward and reverse raw reads files. Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) screened against a fasta file of Arabidopsis thaliana rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.3 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.3/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Arabidopsis thaliana STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl Plants release 54, genome version TAIR10 (Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.toplevel.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.54.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis thaliana STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none (unstranded) and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.At.tair.db (version 3.15.0).",

          "Study Description": "The development of Col-0 and WS plants on orbit differs from that on the ground as demonstrated by the comparison of the gene expression profiles between 4 days old to 8 days old plant in the two environments. The Col-0 plants used different genes reflecting different physiological processes than WS plants, suggesting the role of the genetic background in the developmental decisions. The 4 days old Col-0 plant in orbit showed deficit in wax and suberin production relatively to the 8 days old plants, the difference unregistered on the ground. There was more dramatic difference in the overexpression of the root system development and anatomical structure development genes in 8 days old plants than in 4 days old plant in both genotypes on the ground than in flight, implying smaller root developmental gap between 4 days and 8 days old roots in orbit. The WS plant uniquely showed overexpression of the photosynthesis related genes in the 4 days old roots relative to 8 days old root in the spaceflight environment but not on the ground. The seeds germinated in the novel growth environment of ISS implemented different developmental strategies as captured by the genes expression patterns, than seeds developing on the ground.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Total cellular RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN)     cDNA was synthesized using Ovation Pico WTA System (NuGEN Technologies Inc.) and cDNA was labeled using Encore Biotin Module (NuGEN Technologies Inc.)     Amplified and labeled cDNA (5 ug/sample) was fragmented and hybridized with rotation onto Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays for 16h at 45C. Arrays were washed on a Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) with the Hybridization Wash and Stain Kit (Affymetrix) and the Washing Procedure FS450_0004.     Scan was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G     The MAS5 data was generated by using the Affymetrix Expression Console software using default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.3 (GitHub link coming soon). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.4). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using oligo (version 1.58.0). Raw data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). The raw probe level intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the oligo (version 1.58.0) quantile method. Normalized probe level data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). Normalized probe level data was summarized to the probeset level using the oligo (version 1.58.0) RMA method. Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probeset using the Plants Ensembl database ftp server (plants.ensembl.org, release 54). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probeset to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned for every probeset that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.At.tair.db (version 3.15.0).     The BRIC-17 experiment was turned over to payload engineers in the SLSL at KSC 48 hours before the scheduled launch time. The payload launched on Dragon cargo spacecraft, SpaceX CRS-2 on March 1st, 2013, at 10:10 EST, and achieved orbit approximately twelve minutes later. Dragon berthed to the ISS on the March 3rd, 2013. The biology was in orbit 10 days before being fixed on orbit with RNAlater. The Dragon unmanned spacecraft unberthed the ISS and splashed into Pacific on the March 26th and the biology was returned to the Kennedy Space Center and handed to the PIs at SLSL on the April the 2nd.     General biology operations Two Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 cell culture lines were used: Wild Type (WT) and ARG1 KO SALK_024542C line (ARG1 T-DNA insertion knockout), all cell cultures derived from hypocotyls. Tissue culture cells were plated on 60mm round, nutrient agar Petri plates cultured in a horizontal position until turnover and installation into the BRIC hardware. All of the sub-culturing on the plates was conducted in the laboratory of the PIs and the University of Florida. Plates were planted in a laminar flow hood and stored in sterile Biotransfer Boxes (BT). Plates with cells were kept in the dark and at ambient temperature. Preparation of specialized plates and biology Petri plates. Because of their configuration within the BRIC flight hardware, sterility was maintained on all surfaces (interior and exterior) of the Petri plates. The media in the plates for BRIC had to be 5mm deep or less to accommodate the biology and the PDFU cover hardware. For a 60mm dish, this calculates out to 6.7 mLs. After pouring, the plates are allowed to solidify, and then transferred to a sterile Biotransporter (to maintain sterility of external surface) until planting. Preparation of cell culture plates. The liquid media from a sterile cell suspension was decanted, and the cells were washed once with fresh liquid media, and then decanted again. A sterile scoop was used to place about 1 gram of cells in the surface on the plate and disperse evenly across the surface. The cover was replaced, but not taped, and transferred to a sterile BT. The BT was wrapped in black cloth and stored at room temperature. The same day plates were transported by car to the Kennedy Space Center, NASA for the same night (3:00 AM) Turn Over. The ground control plates were turned over 48 hours later. BRIC Spaceflight Hardware The hardware for this experiment was the NASA BRIC-LED (Biological Research In a Canister - Light Emitting Diode). The LED component of the hardware was disabled and all biology was held in the dark for the duration of the experiment. The BRIC-LED canisters hold six 60 mm diameter Petri plates in small sub-compartments called PDFUs (Petri Dish Fixation Units). The PDFUs allow an externally activated fixation step without manipulating the samples. We were allocated 10 PDFUs: 5 in BRIC A and 5 in BRIC B. The 2 replicate plates of WT cultured cells and the 3 replicate plates of ARG1 KO were distributed among the BRIC A canister. The 2 replicate plates of WT cultured cells were distributed among the BRIC B canister. One of the PDFU slots in each BRIC was used to hold a HOBO data logger to record temperature. The HOBO temperature data collection begins immediately after the biology is sealed in the BRICs, 24 hours before launch. An additional set of Petri plates within BRIC hardware, identical to that launched for Spaceflight, was prepared for the Ground Control. The Ground Control was housed in the OES (Orbital Environmental Simulator) chamber in the Spaceflight Life Sciences Laboratory (SLSL) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The Ground Control was initiated with a precise 24 hour delay to enable the OES environment to be programmed with the environmental profile taken from telemetry of the Space Shuttle. Nominally, the Ground Control BRIC hardware and samples experienced the same external environment profile as the hardware and samples on the Space Shuttle. Environmental parameters that are controlled on the OES and made identical to flight are cabin temperature, humidity and CO2 concentration.",

          "Study Description": "In this study transcriptome profiling was used to gain insight into the spaceflight adaptation role of Altered response to gravity-1 (Arg1), a gene known to affect gravity responses in plants on Earth. The study compared expression profiles of cultured lines of Arabidopsis thaliana derived from wild type (WT) cultivar Col-0 to profiles from a knock-out line deficient in the gene encoding (ARG1 KO), both on the ground and in space. The cell lines were launched on SpaceX CRS-2 as part of the Cellular Expression Logic (CEL) experiment of the BRIC17 spaceflight mission. The cultured cell lines were grown within 60mm Petri plates in Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs) that were housed within the Biological Research In Canisters (BRIC) hardware. Spaceflight samples were fixed on orbit. Differentially expressed genes were identified between the two environments (spaceflight and comparable ground controls) and the two genotypes (WT and ARG1 KO). Each genotype engaged unique genes during physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment, with little overlap. Most of the genes altered in expression in spaceflight in WT cells were found to be Arg1-dependent, suggesting a major role for that gene in the physiological adaptation of undifferentiated cells to spaceflight.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Three seed lines wild-types Wassilewskija (WS), Columbia-0 (Col-0) and Col-0 PhyD (phyD) (SALK_027956C) were tested for viability, sterility and the ability to maintain dormancy before launch. Vetted batches of seeds were planted on Phytagel plates. One genotype was planted per plate, and six plates were planted of each genotype. One complete set of 18 plates was planted for growth on the International Space Station (ISS), and a comparable set of 18 plates was planted 24 hours later for the ground controls. The plates were wrapped such that every surface of the plate was covered by at least two layers of Duvetyne Black-Out cloth (Seattle Fabrics) to help preserve dormancy. The plates were stored at 4C until launch (six days). The plates of the CARA experiment launched on April 18th, 2014 in a cold-stow bag to maintain the plates at 4C within the Dragon Capsule. The dormant plates were activated on the ISS by bringing them out of cold stowage and removing the Black-Out cloth wrapping, 12 days after launch. The plants were allowed to grow on orbit for 13 days; some in the ambient light of ISS and some in the dark. A standard light meter was not available on the ISS, so ambient light levels were approximated through the use of iPad (iPad3, iOS 5.1.1) application 'Light Meter HD- lux measurement tool', which was executed by astronaut Steve Swanson. Light Treatment Group: It was estimated that the light-grown plates received between 4-6 micromoles per square meter per second of total light. Dark Treatment Group: The dark-grown plates were first activated by exposure to light, (the Black-Out cloth was removed from the designated plates for 4 hours), and then re-wrapped in Black-Out cloth for the duration of the growth period.     At 13 days, most seedlings were photographed, and then harvested into Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tubes (KFTs) containing RNAlater. The plants were allowed to perfuse for 12–18 hours at ambient temperature within the KFTs, and then the KFTs were transferred to the MELFI (Minus Eighty-degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS). The frozen KFTs were returned to cold stowage within the Dragon Capsule at the end of the docked operations period, and were returned to Earth on May 18, 2014. Following the Dragon Capsule splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, the frozen KFTs were transferred to the Cold Stowage charter plane at the Long Beach Airport, placed into an insulated shipper with dry ice, and flown to Johnson Space Center (JSC). The KFTs were then transferred via FedEx ground to the Kennedy Space Center. The KFTs were removed from dry ice and transferred to a -80°C freezer on May 22, 2014. The PIs retrieved the plant samples from the KFTs on May 29, 2014 and transferred the frozen samples back to the University of Florida. A comparable set of plates and operations comprised the experimental control set (referred to as the ground control). The plates of the ground control were grown at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) within the ISS Environment Simulator (ISSES) Chamber. The ground control was initiated 24 hours after the initiation of the spaceflight experiment to facilitate the programing the ISSES Chamber with the ISS environmental conditions experienced by the flight plates in the prior 24 hours. The environmental parameters that were monitored and then programed into the ISSES chamber included temperature, CO2 and relative humidity. In addition, the lighting in the ISSES chamber was adjusted to recapitulate the light levels being experienced by the plants on orbit. Light measurements in the ISSES chamber were taken with the same iPad model and operating system (iPad3, iOS 5.1.1) used on the ISS, with the 'Light Meter HD- lux measurement tool' application.     Seedlings stored in RNA later were recovered from -80C freezer. Each tube containing the seedlings was allowed to thaw in the fridge overnight. After completely thawing the samples to room temperature, the seedlings were observed under the microscope. The preserved seedlings from the spaceflight and ground control harvests were dissected into distinct plant parts: leaf, hypocotyl, root tip and then the rest of the root. The root tip was defined as the last 2mm of the root for the light-grown plants and the last 1mm for the dark-grown plants. All the sections dissected were saved in RNA later and stored back to -80C freezer. Three independent roots were used as three biological replicates for the transcriptomic analysis. The root apex was dissected as 2mm root tip section for light grown samples and 1mm section for the dark grown samples. Dissected root tips were carefully transferred into pre-labeled micro-centrifuge tubes, flash frozen in liquid N. Total RNA was extracted from these frozen samples using Picopure RNA isolation kit (Arcturus, Life technologies). RNA concentration was determined on a Qubit (Thermo Fisher/Life Technologies, Inc) and sample quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). Five ng RNA from each sample was used for low input array and RNA sequencing.     RNASeq Libraries Preparation using SMART-Seq V4 ultra low input RNA kit for sequencing combined with Illumina Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit Five ng of total RNA was used for cDNA library construction using CloneTech SMART-Seq V4 ultra low input RNA kit for sequencing (Clontech Laboratories, Inc, cat : 634890) according to manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 1st strand cDNA was primed by the SMART-Seq v4 oligonucleotide and then base-pairs with these additional nucleotides, creating an extended template. The reverse transcriptase then switches templates and continues transcribing to the end of the oligonucleotide, resulting full-length cDNA that contains an anchor sequence that serves as a universal priming site for second strand synthesis. cDNA was amplified with primer II A for 9 PCR cycles. Then Illumina sequencing libraries were generated with 120 pg of cDNA using Illumina Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Cat : FC-131-1024) according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 120 pg of cDNA was fragmented by tagementation reaction and then adapter sequences added onto template cDNA by PCR amplification. Libraries were quantitated by Bioanalyzer and qPCR (Kapa Biosystems, catalog number: KK4824). Finallly, the libraries were pooled equal molar concentration and sequenced by Illumina 2X75 NextSeq 500.     NextSeq500 sequencing: RNA seq In preparation for sequencing, barcoded libraries were sized on the bioanalyzer, quantitated by QUBIT and qPCR (Kapa Biosystems, catalog number: KK4824). Individual samples were pooled equimolarly at 4 nM. This working pool was used as input in the NextSeq500 instrument sample preparation protocol (Illumina, Part   15048776, Rev A). Typically, a 1.3 pM library concentration resulted in optimum clustering density in our instrument (i.e., around 200,000 clusters per mm2). Samples were sequenced on three flowcells, using a 2x75 cycles (paired-end) configuration. A typical sequencing run in the NextSeq500 produced 750-800 million paired-end read with a Q30 greater than or equal to 85%. For RNA seq, around 40 million reads provided sufficient depth for transcriptome analysis.     Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) screened against a fasta file of Arabidopsis thaliana rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on Aug-2019. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.3 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.3/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7) with adaptor auto detect enabled to trim Nextera adaptors*. Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Arabidopsis thaliana STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl Plants release 54, genome version TAIR10 (Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.toplevel.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.54.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis thaliana STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none (unstranded) and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.At.tair.db (version 3.15.0).\n\n*Note: This is a difference from GL-DPPD-7101 which specific `–Illumina` .     The developmental progress of plant growth was followed through a series of photographs taken by the attending astronaut on the ISS, and by the attending technician at KSC, providing an independent 'pseudonaut' on the ground in order to mimic astronaut activities on the ISS. The photographs in figure 2 of the article show representative images that compared the progress of growth after 3d, 6d and 9d for each genotype. The photographs were often taken through the back of each plate. The region of interest was cropped from each astronaut-captured photograph to better display the progress of plant development. The photography taken on the ISS used Nikon cameras, whereas the ground control used a Panasonic camera. OSDR staff extracted parameter 'Plate Number' from the raw image files and reported here.",

          "Study Description": "Experimentation on the International Space Station has reached the stage where repeated and nuanced transcriptome studies are beginning to illuminate the structural and metabolic differences between plants grown in space compared to plants on the Earth. Genes that are important in establishing the spaceflight responses are being identified, their roles in spaceflight physiological adaptation are increasingly understood, and the fact that different genotypes adapt differently is recognized. However, the basic question of whether these spaceflight responses are actually required for survival has yet to be posed, and the fundamental notion that spaceflight responses may be non-adaptive has yet to be explored. Therefore the experiments presented here were designed to ask if portions of the plant spaceflight response can be genetically removed without causing loss of spaceflight survival and without causing increased stress responses. The CARA experiment compared the spaceflight transcriptome responses in the root tips of two Arabidopsis ecotypes, Col-0 and WS, as well as that of a PhyD mutant of Col-0. When grown with the ambient light of the ISS, phyD plants displayed a significantly reduced spaceflight transcriptome response compared to Col-0, suggesting that altering the activity of a single gene can actually improve spaceflight adaptation by reducing the transcriptome cost of physiological adaptation. The WS genotype showed an even simpler spaceflight transcriptome response in the ambient light of the ISS, more broadly indicating that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the cost of spaceflight adaptation, as measured by transcriptional response. These differential genotypic responses suggest that genetic manipulation could further reduce, or perhaps eliminate the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. When plants were germinated and then left in the dark on the ISS, the WS genotype actually mounted a larger transcriptome response than Col-0, suggesting that the in-space light environment affects physiological adaptation, which implies that manipulating the local habitat can also substantially impact the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Immediately following the landing of the Shuttle, the BRIC-16 samples were prepared for de-integration from the hardware. Petri plates were removed from the flight and ground hardware and the plates with seedlings were photographed by Jin Nakashima using a Canon PowerShot SX20 IS. These were later analyzed to assess gross morphology and germination (reported in Johnson et al., 2015 and Millar et al., 2011) using Image J and Image Pro Plus. All of the images that correlated with the transcriptomics and glycomics data have been shared within the morphometric analysis assay table. This includes PDFU 2, 3, and 4 within BRIC F for both Spaceflight and Ground Control samples. All Petri plates were photographed at harvest, and all photographs can be found within the supplemental materials. These include images of plates that were stabilized with glutaraldehyde and paraformaldehyde, as well as those stabilized with RNAlater that were not used for Glycomics and Transcriptomics analyses. An example of an image name is F_F2-2. This refers to Flight, BRIC F, PDFU 2, image 2. Another example is G_F2-2, which translates to Ground, BRIC F, PDFU 2, image 2.     To process the BRIC-16-Cyt samples before the microarray studies, we thawed the samples and bisected them to separate roots from shoots. Tissues from shoots only were used for this study. Tissue of shoots was disrupted in a microcentrifuge tube using a Pellet Pestle motor (Kontes, Vineland, New Jersey, USA) and sterile RNase-free pestle tip (Stimpson et al., 2009). Extraction was conducted using the RNeasy Mini Plant Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the procedure outlined in the RNeasy Mini Handbook. The total RNA was provided to the University of Florida’s Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) Gene Expression Core Facility. There, sample was quantified using the NanoDrop Spectrophotometer ND-8000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, Delaware, USA), and quality was determined using the RNA 6000 Pico LabChip (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA) and its corresponding ladder (RNA 6000 ladder, Ambion, Foster City, California, USA) containing transcript sizes of 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 and 6.0 kb on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Of the samples prepared, the three plates with the highest quality RNA were chosen from ground control (labeled H) and spaceflight (labeled F) to run the microarray. Note: The samples labeled ground control were taken from the Pre-flight Verification Test (PVT) because the quality of the RNA from the official Ground Control was lacking. See supplemental file with bioanalyzer results.     RNA amplification and purification of BRIC-16-Cyt were conducted by the ICBR using the Ovation Pico WTA system for biotin target labeling. Chemical and enzymatic fragmentation of cRNA was completed in a thermal cycler at 37C for 60 min, and 70C for 10 min, with a final holding at 4C until sample removal. A Nano Drop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Wilmington, DE) was used to assess the yield of the labeled cRNA.     Hybridization to the microarray gene chip was conducted following the standard protocol outlined in the technical manual for Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).     Raw data from microarray studies was processed using Microarray Suite Version 5 software (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) to convert the intensity information to quantitative values.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.5 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.5/Microarray/Affymetrix/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAffymetrix). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.4). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using oligo (version 1.58.0). Raw data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). The raw probe level intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the oligo (version 1.58.0) quantile method. Normalized probe level data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). Normalized probe level data was summarized to the probeset level using the oligo (version 1.58.0) RMA method. Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probeset using the Plants Ensembl database ftp server (plants.ensembl.org, release 54). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probeset to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned for every probeset that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.At.tair.db (version 3.15.0).     For the BRIC-16-Cyt experiment (J. Z. Kiss, Principal Investigator), seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (Ler-0) were surface-sterilized in a solution of 1 drop octyl phenol ethoxylate (TX-100) in 100 mL of 70% (v/v) ethanol for 5 min, followed by two, 1-min rinses in 95% (v/v) ethanol. An additional washing with 1 drop TX-100 in 100 mL water was followed by four final rinses in sterile water. Under sterile conditions within a laminar flow hood, seeds were sown in one row of 40 seeds on 13 total Petri plates (60 mm) on 1.2% (w/v) agar containing 1 mM MES buffer at pH 5.5, 1% (w/v) sucrose, one-half strength Murashige and Skoog basal salts.  During the sowing process of the BRIC-16-Cyt seeds, the quality of each seed was assessed using a stereomicroscope and damaged seeds were discarded. Petri plates were sealed with Parafilm M (Bemis Company, Oshkosh, Wisconsin, USA), placed in a sealed sterile box then allowed 1 day incubation in darkness at a controlled 24°C before integration into the Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Unit (BRIC-PDFU) flight hardware and ground hardware. These were loaded into the mid-deck of the Shuttle Discovery shortly after planting, as a late stow. A total of 8 BRIC units were flown as part of BRIC-16. BRIC E, F, and a portion of H were designated for the Kiss team, while BRIC A, B, C, D, G, and a portion of H were designated for the other two investigative teams, led by Elison Blancaflor and Anna-Lisa Paul. The Ground Control ran on a 24 hour delay within a growth chamber at Kennedy Space Center's Space Life Sciences Lab. Within each BRIC unit there were 5 PDFU, and a temperature data logger. The Kiss lab used PDFU numbers 1-5 for both E and F BRIC units, and PDFU numbers 3-5 for the H unit.     Stabilization in RNAlater was completed in-orbit by an astronaut after 309 h of growth of the plants in darkness in the BRIC-PDFU. Following landing and after 53 h in RNA later, the BRIC-16 samples were prepared for deintegration. They were transported to the University of Florida, Gainesville, where they were stored at -80C until the RNA was extracted.   Ground controls for all BRIC-16 samples were prepared in the same initial manner but with a 24-h delay from spaceflight samples. A ground control locker was placed within a growth chamber known as the orbital environmental simulator (OES) at the SLSL, which attempted to duplicate the temperature and humidity data collected from Discovery’s middeck, on a 24-h delay. The ground control locker was repositioned manually to mimic the directionality changes of the Shuttle’s launch sequence. Stabilization of all BRIC-16 samples was conducted in parallel to the process in-orbit, again on the same 24-h delay.     The absorbed dose from ionizing radiation received by the flight specimens was estimated using TLD passive dosimeters located in the middeck of the space shuttle, where the payload was located. More specifically, we computed the average between three dosimeters (DLOC1, DLOC2, and DLOC3) for the mission and we divided it by the total duration of the mission to estimate the average absorbed dose rate in mGy/day. This dose rate did not include any shielding effects from the hardware where the specimens resided. The total absorbed dose in water was then computed by simply multiplying the average dose rate with the duration of the experiment. The duration of the experiment was defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”. Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. A table with these detailed computations for all space shuttle datasets is available on GeneLab at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation. The ground samples were not assessed for radiation exposure.     The cell wall glycomics analyses were performed at the University of Georgia Complex Carbohydrate Research Center (CCRC, Athens, GA). Tissue that remained in the shredder columns from the RNA extraction process from BRIC-16-Cyt samples were used to run an ELISA-based glycome analysis employing a comprehensive suite of plant cell wall glycan directed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)(Pattathil et al., 2012 , 2015 ,  2016 ).This zero waste procedure allowed us to maximize the data produced from a minimal amount of spaceflight-grown tissue. Briefly, cell wall materials (alcohol insoluble residues; AIR) were isolated from ground and spacefl ight grown plant tissues as described previously ( Pattathil et al., 2012 ). Cell wall materials were subsequently subjected to a high alkaline extraction (4 M KOH with 1% w/v sodium borohydride) to extract most major noncellulosic cell wall glycans. Th e 4 M KOH extract was then neutralized, exhaustively dialyzed, and lyophilized for subsequent ELISA screens with the entire collection of cell-wall-glycan-directed mAbs ( Pattathil et al., 2012 ). Th is process was extensively tested by CCRC staff with small quantities of Earth-grown Arabidopsis tissue samples before conducting these spacefl ight studies, and their results were largely comparable to the results obtained with the BRIC-16-Cyt samples. Heat maps were produced using antibodies binding strength values obtained aft er ELISA screens ( Pattathil et al., 2012 ). Cell walls were extracted from the shoot tissues to obtain a glycome profi le, as explained above. ELISAs were performed with 0.3 μg glucose equivalent carbohydrate per-well basis in technical duplicates, and the presented data represent background-noise-subtracted means of the replicate assay. Cell-wall-glycan-directed mAbs were obtained from laboratory stocks (CCRC, JIM and MAC series) at the Complex Carbohydrate Research Center (available through CarboSource Services; http://www.carbosource.net ) and BG1 and LAMP (LAMP2HI2H7) were from BioSupplies (Yagoona, Australia).     Materials for ELISA\n1. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Plate: Costar 3598 acid-resistant flat-bottom 96-well plate (Corning Life Sciences, Acton, MA).\n2. 0.1 M Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.6: Fill about 3500 mL of ultrapure (~18.2 M Ω cm) water into a 4 L container, add 23.38 g of sodium chloride to the water and stir until dissolved. Add 1.11 g of Tris-Base and 4.85 g of Tris–HCl, respectively, to the container and stir until dissolved. Make up the volume to 4 L with ultrapure water and stir completely until uniformly mixed. Buffer stock can be stored at room temperature until needed.\n3. Blocking Buffer: 1.0% (w/v) Milk in 0.1 M TBS: To about 500 mL of 0.1 M TBS and stir in 10.0 g of Nonfat Dry Milk (Instant Non-fat Dry Milk, Publix). After 3 h of stirring, make up the solution to 1 L with 0.1 M TBS, then mix uniformly and store at 4°C.\n4. Wash Buffer: 0.1% (w/v) Milk in 0.1 M TBS. Dilute the Blocking Buffer solution tenfold using 0.1 M TBS.\n5. Primary antibodies: CCRC series of antibodies are generated in mouse; JIM, MAC, and LM series of antibodies are generated in rat. A Web-accessible database listing most of the available plant cell wall glycan-directed mAbs and providing information about their characteristics and suppliers can be found at WallMabDB ( http://www.wallmabdb.net ). The three main suppliers of plant glycan-directed antibodies are: CarboSource ( http://www.carbosource.net ), PlantProbes ( http://www.plantprobes.net ) and BioSupplies ( http://www.biosupplies.com.au/. )\n6. Secondary antibody: Anti-Mouse (Sigma Catalogue A4416) or Anti-Rat (Sigma Catalogue A9037) IgG whole molecule Goat antibody, conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The secondary antibody should be diluted according to the manufacturer’s instructions; in our case, the secondary antibody is diluted 1:5,000 in Wash Buffer to the required volume just prior to use. Secondary antibody stocks should be stored at −20°C when not in use.\n7. Substrate: TMB Peroxidase Substrate Kit SK-4400 (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Make fresh without using the stabilizer (that is included in the kit), mix two drops of the pH 5.3 Buffer, three drops of the TMB and two drops of hydrogen peroxide in 15 mL of water. Store kit at 4°C when not in use.\n8. Stop solution: 0.5 N Sulfuric acid (for 100 mL of 0.5N Sulfuric Acid, mix 1 mL of 18 M Sulfuric Acid with 71 mL of deionized water).\nMethods for ELISA\n1. Coating of the ELISA plates: All wall extract samples are diluted to a sugar concentration of 20 μg/mL. Add 50 μL per well of each wall extract dilution onto the ELISA plates (with the number of wells coated equaling the number of mAbs to be tested plus controls) and evaporate to dryness overnight in a ventilated 37°C incubator.\n2. Blocking: Nonspecific sites in the coated ELISA plates are blocked by adding 200 μL per well of Blocking Buffer and incubating the plates for an hour at room temperature.\n3. Addition of primary antibodies (mAbs): Aspirate the blocking buffer from each well. Dispense 50 μL of primary mAb into each well. Incubate plates with the primary antibodies for an hour at room temperature.\n4. Washing the plates: Aspirate the primary antibodies from each well. Wash each plate with 300 μL of wash buffer, wait 5 s, and completely aspirate the buffer. Repeat two more times for a total of three washes.\n5. Secondary antibodies: After washing, 50 μL per well of secondary antibody is added to the ELISA plates. Anti-mouse or anti-rat secondary antibodies (mixed at a 1:5,000 dilution in Wash Buffer) are dispensed into the respective mouse (for example, CCRC series) and rat (for example, JIM series) primary antibody-bound wells and incubated at room temperature for 1 h.\n6. Washing secondary antibodies: Aspirate the secondary antibodies from each well after the incubation. Wash each plate with 300 μL of Wash Buffer, wait 5 s, and completely aspirate the buffer. Repeat four more times for a total of five washes.\n7. Adding substrate and termination: Dispense 50 μL per well of TMB substrate solution into each well, allow each plate to incubate for precisely 20 min, and then stop the reaction using 50 μL per well of 0.5 N sulfuric acid.\n8. Quantitation: Immediately after termination, measure the net OD values of the color formation in the wells of ELISA plates using an ELISA plate reader at 450 nm and subtracting a background reading at 655 nm.\n\nPattathil, S., Avci, U., Miller, J.

It informs how gene regulation is altered by spaceflight conditions. We noted expression changes in genes involved in hypoxia and heat shock responses, DNA repair, and cell wall structure between spaceflight samples compared to the ground controls. In addition, glycome profiling supported our expression analyses in that there was a difference in cell wall components between ground control and spaceflight-grown plants. Comparing our studies to those of the other BRIC-16 experiments demonstrated that, even with the same hardware and similar biological materials, differences in results in gene expression were found among these spaceflight experiments.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "After recovery of the sample module after 17 days of flight, the RNAlater-treated samples were transferred to Eppendorf cups and stored below minus 20C until RNA extraction. Rice calli were harvested from three or four biological replicates and used for microarray analysis.     Rice calli were generated from embryos of Oryza sativa under sterile conditions. Calli obtained on N6 medium (containing 2 mg/ml 2,4-D, 1% agar) were transferred to N6 medium without 2,4-D and grown at 24C in the dark. Rice calli were cultured on a specimen slide with N6 medium without 2,4-D; 0.2-0.3 g cells were used in each specimen slide. Several hours before launching,  the specimen slides carrying rice calli after 5 days of pre-culture were transferred to the housing chamber; then, the EUEs were loaded into the culture box (SIMBOX) aboard Shenzhou-8. The sample was loaded, and the experiment container was assembled according to the User Manual provided by ASTRIUM.     Cells were fixed using RNAlater (ABI, US) after a flight of 324 h (the calli grew under microgravtiy for about 324 h). The time from launch until microgravity stared was about 10 mins and the time from launch until centrifuge was switch on is about 36 mins.     Total RNA was extracted using TRIZOL Reagent (Cat 15596-018, Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, US) following the manufacturer's instructions.     Total RNA were amplified, labeled and purified by using GeneChip 3√≠IVT Express Kit (Cat 901229, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, US) followed the manufacturer's instructions to obtain biotin labeled cRNA.     Affymetrix microarray hybridization was carried out by the ShanghaiBio Corporation. RNA target preparation and microarray hybridization were performed using the GeneChip 3'IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix) and the GeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit (Affymetrix) strictly following the manufacturer's instructions.     The signal intensity for each probe set on the GeneChip microarray was detected using a GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix), and the raw signal value for each probe set was analyzed using GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS; Affymetrix).     The use of an in-flight centrifuge provided a 1 g gravitational field in space. The cells were metabolically quenched after 5 days via RNAlater injection. Radiation measurements yielded a total dose of 5.93 to 8.1 mSv and an equivalent dose of 0.37 to 0.51 mSv/d near the Simbox incubator (telemetry data: SZ-8 investigators, personal communication with Dr. Jack Miller).",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes Col-0, Ler-0, Ws-2, and Cvi-0 were obtained from Lehle Seeds (Round Rock, TX, USA) and were surface-sterilized in 70% (w/v) ethanol for 2 min, dried on sterile Whatman 3M filter paper (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 64 seeds per 60 mm Petri dish of each were planted on 15 mL of sterile 1/2 strength Epstein's medium (Wymer et al., 1997) supplemented with 1% (w/v) Phytagel (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 mM sucrose, pH 5.7. The seeded dishes were then irradiated for 12 h with 70 mol m-2 s-1 white light from a fluorescent fixture (F20T12/CW; Osram Sylvania, Wilmington, MA, USA) at 22C to synchronize subsequent germination once transferred to the ISS. The irradiated dishes were then stored at 4C in the dark for ~8 h until integration into the flight hardware. Each Petri dish was assembled into a single stage Petri Dish Fixation Unit cassette (PDFU; Wells et al., 2001) under sterile conditions. The PDFU liquid injection reservoir was filled with 13 mL RNAlater solution (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) and five PDFUs plus a HOBO data-logger (Onset Computer Corp., Bourne, MA, USA) were integrated into the Biological Research in Canister (BRIC) hardware (Wells et al., 2001), which was stored at 4C before launch to inhibit seed germination. The hardware was then transferred in a Double Cold Bag (Hutchinson and Campana, 2009), held at 4C, to the Dragon capsule of SpaceX mission CRS-4 where it was stowed 48 h before launch. Four BRICs were used for the analysis, allowing for an experimental design with four plates each of Col-0 and Ws-2 and three plates each of Ler-0 and Cvi-0. SpaceX CRS-4 launched on 21 September 2014 and docked with the ISS ~2 d later. After a further ~2 d on orbit, the BRICs were removed from the cold bag and allowed to warm to ISS ambient temperature (~24C) over 3 h. This timeline meant that the seeds were stored at 4C for 150 h from the time of integration into the BRIC hardware to removal from the cold bag on orbit. Plates were then left at ISS ambient for the seeds to germinate and seedlings to grow for 8 d. RNAlater was then injected onto the sample plates by actuating the PDFUs. Samples were allowed to fix for 12 h, then the BRICs were loaded into the Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer on the ISS (MELFI) for sample storage. For return to Earth, the BRICs were removed from the MELFI, packed into a freezer bag (that maintained -32C throughout the return process) and loaded into the Dragon capsule. The payload splashed down on 25 October 2014 and was shipped to Kennedy Space Center, FL, USA, where the BRIC canisters were transferred to a -80C laboratory freezer. The hardware was then thawed at 4C to allow disassembly of the BRIC and the Petri dishes were de-integrated from their PDFUs. A further 10 mL of RNAlater was added to each dish, and the dishes were then frozen at -20C, packed on dry ice and shipped to Madison, WI, USA where they were stored in a -80C freezer for subsequent analysis. A duplicate set of BRICs was used for the ground control experiments. These samples were treated identically to the flight materials but were transferred to the ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES) for the period that the flight samples were grown on board the ISS. To facilitate programming the environmental conditions of the ISSES to mimic those on the ISS, the ground controls were run with a 48 h delay to the flight experiment. After 8 d of growth in the ISSES, RNAlater was injected, with the timing and order of RNAlater actuation for each PDFU closely mirroring that of the flight protocol. The samples were left for 12 h, then the BRICs containing the sample plates were transferred to a -80C laboratory freezer. These samples were de-integrated from the hardware alongside the flight materials as described above. From this point onward, all other manipulations of the samples were identical to the flight material.\n\nBRIC-PDFU (Petri Dish Fixation Unit):  The BRIC-PDFU configuration allows biological specimens contained within 60 mm Petri dishes to be installed into polycarbonate blocks that are then installed into an aluminum box.  The polycarbonate blocks (PDFUs) provide the ability to deliver both nutrient and fixative solutions to biological specimens housed in the Petri dishes.  Important information can be gained through simple investigations in which organisms are taken to space, chemically fixed (or stabilized), and then returned for post-flight processing. The BRIC-PDFU is designed to accomplish this using a minimal amount (typically less than one hour) of astronaut crew time. Biological specimens are placed into the 60 mm Petri dishes containing agar-solidified media, although alternative approaches will be considered. Each Petri dish is then placed inside its own individually-sealed PDFU. The PDFUs are assembled and loaded with up to 17mL of either one or two fluids, such as a nutrient solution and/or a chemical fixative, in a reservoir compartment as specified by the selected investigators. Six PDFUs or five PDFUs plus one temperature data logger, depending on the investigator’s requirements, are then loaded into each BRIC canister.  No electrical power is provided to the BRIC-PDFU.     Samples were pulverized using a GeneGrinder in 0.5 mL of extraction buffer. Total RNA was then isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Residual genomic DNA was removed by RNase-free DNase I treatment using the TURBO DNase kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions.     Purified total RNA was subjected to rRNA reduction (Ribo-Zero plant leaf kit, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), and a library was created using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit according to the manufacturer's directions.      Paired-end, 1x100 bp next-generation sequencing was performed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Sequencing Facility using a HiSeq2000 (Illumina, USA) and CASAVA 1.8.2 as the base caller software. Libraries were multiplexed, with four libraries sequenced in each lane, producing ~80 million total reads per sample.     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Arabidopsis thaliana STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 44, genome version TAIR10 (Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.toplevel.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.44.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis thaliana STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads from 3 samples were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.0.3) with tximport (version 1.18.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.30.0). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.30.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.2.0), PANTHER.db (v1.0.10), and org.At.tair.db (v3.12.0).     RNAlater was then injected onto the sample plates by actuating the PDFUs. Samples were allowed to fix for 12 h, then the BRICs were loaded into the Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer on the ISS (MELFI) for sample storage. For return to Earth, the BRICs were removed from the MELFI, packed into a freezer bag (that maintained -32C throughout the return process) and loaded into the Dragon capsule.

          "Study Description": "This experiment compared the spaceflight transcriptomes of four commonly used natural variants (ecotypes) of Arabidopsis thaliana using RNAseq. In nature, Arabidopsis is a native of Europe/Asia/Northwestern Africa and is found across the globe growing in a wide range of environments. The geographical spread of these various populations has led to a slow divergence leading to distinct ecotypes. Understanding the impact of this ecotypic variability is an important factor when using Arabidopsis as a model. Seeds of the ecotypes Col_0, Ler-2, Ws-2 and Cvi-0 were flown to the International Space Station as part of CRS-4 mission in the Biological Research in Canister (BRIC) hardware. The seeds were germinated on orbit, grown for 8 days and then fixed in RNAlater and frozen in the MELFI freezer for return to Earth. Once returned RNA was isolated and RNAseq performed to catalog the transcriptional patterns of the plants grown in space. An identical set of samples were grown in parallel on the ground to provide controls to allow assessment of transcriptional changes specifically associated with the spaceflight environment. This data release includes 48 out of 56 sample expression files with the remaining 8 files to be released at a later date.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "To identify transcripts regulated by microgravity, Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were grown on the BRIC hardware for two weeks under complete darkness. The experimental design included two genotypes: wild-type (Col-0 ecotype) and the vegetative actin mutant, act2-3 (Nakashima et al. 2014). 150-200 seeds of each genotype were planted separately on a single 60 mm Petri dish layered with growth media. After planting, a single Petri dish was inserted into a Petri Dish Fixation Unit (PDFU) and sealed with a light-tight metal lid. For the transcriptomic work described here, we used four PDFUs for each genotype with three PDFUs representing three biological replicates. Five PDFUs were installed in a single BRIC unit and BRICs were loaded on a foam padded transport unit (Nakashima et al. 2014). One set of BRICs was loaded on the middeck of the Space Shuttle Discovery (spaceflight set) and another set was kept in an Orbital Environmental Simulator at the Space Life Sciences Laboratory at the Kennedy Space Center (ground control set). In summary, the groups of seedlings used for gene profiling analyses described here were ground controls wild-type (GW), ground controls act2-3 (GA), spaceflight wild-type (SW) and spaceflight act2-3 (SA). The Space Shuttle Discovery for mission STS-131 launched from the Kennedy Space Center on April 5, 2010 and landed on April 20, 2010. On orbit and ground control fixation of seedlings was completed 14 days after launch. Seedling fixation on orbit and on the ground was accomplished by releasing RNA Later into the compartment of the PDFU containing the seedlings using an actuator gun. Fixed seedlings were retrieved from the BRIC-PDFUs within 4 h after the Space Shuttle Discovery landed for RNA extraction.     The absorbed dose from ionizing radiation received by the flight specimens was estimated using TLD passive dosimeters located in the middeck of the space shuttle, where the payload was located. More specifically, we computed the average between three dosimeters (DLOC1, DLOC2, and DLOC3) for the mission and we divided it by the total duration of the mission to estimate the average absorbed dose rate in mGy/day. This dose rate did not include any shielding effects from the hardware where the specimens resided. The total absorbed dose in water was then computed by simply multiplying the average dose rate with the duration of the experiment. The duration of the experiment was defined as the time in space during which the specimen was 'living'. Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. A table with these detailed computations for all space shuttle datasets is available on GeneLab at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.  The ground samples were not assessed for radiation exposure.     Total RNA was extracted from the etiolated seedlings using Plant RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA was quantified with the NanoDrop 8000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Willmington, DE), and the quality was monitored using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).     Transcription profiling using the GeneChip 3 IVT Express kit and Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array according to the manufacturers instructions (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).     Transcription profiling using the GeneChip 3 IVT Express kit and Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array according to the manufacturers instructions (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.5 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.5/Microarray/Affymetrix/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAffymetrix). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.4). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using oligo (version 1.58.0). Raw data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). The raw probe level intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the oligo (version 1.58.0) quantile method. Normalized probe level data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). Normalized probe level data was summarized to the probeset level using the oligo (version 1.58.0) RMA method. Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probeset using the Plants Ensembl database ftp server (plants.ensembl.org, release 54). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probeset to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned for every probeset that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.At.tair.db (version 3.15.0).",

Samples were processed using the MessageAmp II-Biotin Enhanced, Single Round aRNA Amplification Kit (Ambion, Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany).     Fragmented, biotin-labeled aRNA was then submitted to a high throughput microarray analysis (GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Array, Ref: 510690, LOT: 4155830, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, California, USA). Hybridization was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.     Expression data were calculated from raw values of the detected signal intensity of hybridization events of all spotted probe sets and saved as .CEL data files.     Sterile cuttings of stems of wild type Arabidopsis thaliana (cv. Columbia Col-0) plants were used for callus formation on 1.2a media containing 1 % agar. Calli were transferred to 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks with 200 ml liquid 1.2a medium and cultivated under sterile conditions at 23.0C in the dark on a rotary shaker. One day before the mission, 100 mg of 11-day-old callus cultures were transferred into the culture chambers (CCs) with 2 ml agar containing medium.     2 samples per sample group (FS, FC, GS) were exposed either to 5 days microgravity (sample group FS front and rear cultivation chamber), 1g in-flight conditions (FC front and rear chamber) or 1g Earth gravitation for ground controls (GS front and rear chamber) in the Simbox hardware.

          "Study Protocol Description": "Seeds of Mizuna, Brassica rapa var. nipposinica, were transported to ISS. Ten-15 seeds were set in each of two root modules of the Lada growth chambers aboard the Zvezda module of ISS, and allowed to germinate. Lada consists of a control module, a water reservoir and 2 growth chambers which include a root module, leaf chamber and light module. The light banks house two cool white flourescent lamps providing approximately 125-250 μmol m-2 s-1 (depending on plant height) photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). In the overall Lada experiment, two root module growth substrate mixtures were used to determine which was optimal for plant growth. One mixture contained rinsed and dried arcillite (Turface Proleague, Profile LLC, Buffalo Grove IL, US) with 15 grams of 14-14-14 Osmocote fertilizer, the other, nutrient solution soaked and dried arcillite with 14 grams of a custom mixed Nutricote fertilizer. The Lada moisture level control point was set at 85% at the start of the experiment for both root modules. One of the root modules experienced an over-watering event in which the pump failed to stop when the moisture sensors reached 85% and almost 2 liters of water was added in 35 hours. Automatic watering was disabled and the pump was operated manually for the duration of the experiment. This was duplicated in the ground controls. Because of the difference in watering regimes, only the plant tissue from the Osmocote fertilized root modules with manually controlled watering, both flight and ground controls, were used for this study. The plants were grown in Lada under 24 hr lighting. The average environmental conditions measured from the Zvezda module of the ISS over the duration of the experiment and duplicated for the ground controls were 24.3 ± 0.8°C, 3.27 ± 0.46 mm Hg pp CO2, (= 4,303 ± 605 ppm CO2) and 40.7 ± 6.9% RH. The average recorded values for the ground control experiment were 24.5 ± 0.5°C, 4,254 ± 566 ppm CO2, and 41.2 ± 2.6 RH. After 27 days of cultivation, the plants were harvested and stored at -80°C in the MELFI freezer onboard the Destiny module, and were transported to the ground at < -20°C in the GLACIER cold stowage system aboard the Space Shuttle. The total radiation dose during cultivation was 8.37 mGy.     Total RNA from leaves samples was extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).     cDNA library was constructed using the TruSeqTM RNA sample preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).     Sequencing was performed on each library to generate 100-bp paired-end reads for transcriptome sequencing on Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx platform.     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.1.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.4). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.8) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Brassica rapa STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.3a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 43, genome version 1.0, release-43 (Brassica_rapa.Brapa_1.0.dna.toplevel.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Brassica_rapa.Brapa_1.0.43.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Brassica rapa STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.3a) and aligned reads from both samples were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.0.3) with tximport (version 1.18.0) to generate unnormalized (raw) counts table. Differential expression analysis was not performed due to lack of biological replicates.",

          "Study Description": "Space environment is suspected to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induce oxidative stress in plants, however, little is known about the gene expression of ROS gene network in plants grown in long-term space flight. RNA-Seq was used to define the large-scale gene expression profiles of Mizuna harvested after 27 days cultivation in the international space station to understand the molecular response and adaptation to space environment.Results: Total reads of transcripts from the Mizuna grown in the international space station as well as on the ground by RNA-Seq using next generation sequencing technology showed 8,258 and 14,170 transcripts up- and down-regulated in the space-grown Mizuna, respectively, when compared with those from the ground-grown Mizuna. A total of 20 in 32 ROS oxidative marker genes were up-regulated, including high expression of 4 hallmarks, and preferentially expressed gene associated with ROS-scavenging genes was thioredoxin, glutaredoxin, and alternative oxidase genes. In the transcription factors of ROS gene network , MEKK1-MKK4-MPK3, OXI1-MKK4-MPK3, and OXI1-MPK3 of MAP cascades, induction of WRKY22 by MEKK1-MKK4-MPK3 cascade, induction of WRKY25 and repression of ZAT7 by Zat12 were suggested. RbohD and RbohF genes were up-regulated preferentially in NADPH oxidase genes, which produce ROS.Conclusions: Our large-scale transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the space environment induced oxidative stress and ROS gene network was activated in the space-grown Mizuna, some of which were common genes up-regulated by abiotic and biotic stress and were preferentially up-regulated genes by the space environment, even though Mizuna grew in the space as well as on the ground, showing that plants could acclimate to the space environment by reprograming the expression of ROS gene network.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Plant Lines and Seed Dormancy: Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) plants were grown in a vertical configuration on the surface of 10 cm2 solid media plates.  Three GFP (Green fluorescent Protein reporter gene lines were used:  Adh::GFP (alcohol dehydrogenase promoter), DR5::GFP (synthetic auxin response element) and UB::GFP (35sCaMV constitutive promoter). Seeds, and the seeded plates, were prepared in such a way as to maintain dormancy until the initiation of the experiment on orbit. Seeds were surface sterilized with 75% ethanol for 10 minutes, dried on sterile filter paper and stored at 4C until use. Immediately before planting onto media plates, a small amount of seed was suspended in sterile water and the seeds were dispersed individually to the surface of the plate.  The plate was then immediately wrapped in light-tight black cloth (Duvatyne) and stored at room temperature until launch. After launch (Shuttle launch STS-131, Orbiter Discovery, April, 2010) and transition to the International Space Station (ISS), the wrapped plates were stowed at ambient temperature for 12 days until the initiation of the experiment on orbit.  The dry-sterilized seeds remained dormant until activated by exposure to light. Experiment Unique Equipment and Environmental Conditions: Both the flight and ground control components of the experiment were grown in specialized growth chamber units developed by Kennedy Space Center referred to as ABRS (Advanced Biological Research System) growth chamber.  Seeded plates were unwrapped from their light-tight coverings and installed in a specialized GFP imaging system (GIS) designed to hold six plates ÔøΩ one in the direct line of fluorescent excitation LEDs and the imaging camera, plus five additional plates. GFP expression data were collected on orbit form the imaging plate, and after 12 days of growth, all plates were harvested on orbit to RNAlater-filled KSC Fixation Tubes (KFTs) and then stowed below -40C on station.  The Ground Control was housed in the Orbital Environmental Simulator (OES) chamber in the Spaceflight Life Sciences Laboratory at Kennedy Space Center. The Ground Control was initiated with a precise 48 hour delay to enable the OES environment to be programed with those environmental conditions that can be replicated on the ground, such as cabin temperature and CO2 levels, taken from ISS telemetry.     After growth, all plates were harvested on orbit to RNAlater-filled KSC Fixation Tubes (KFTs) and then stowed below -40°C on the ISS before return. Plants harvested to RNAlater-filled KFTs were returned from ISS stowage with Orbiter Atlantis for the return flight of STS-132 and transferred to the PIs.     Total RNA was isolated form sets of intact 12 day old seedlings, and from seedlings separated into three tissue types: leaves (cut from the plant at base of each petiole), hypocotyls (the region between the root/shoot junction and the start of the leaf rosette) and roots. Total cellular RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN).     The first method (6 arrays total): cDNA was synthesized using Ovation Pico WTA System (NuGEN Technologies Inc.). The second method (30 arrays total): cDNA was synthesized using Affymetrix 3'IVT kit for cDNA synthesis and labeling, using reverse transcription-IVT (RT-IVT) method, known as Eberwine method. Reverse Transcription to Synthesize First-Strand cDNA is primed with T7 oligo(dT) primer to synthesize cDNA containing a T7 promoter sequence.Second-Strand cDNA Synthesis converts the single-stranded cDNA into a doublestranded DNA (dsDNA) template for transcription. The reaction employs DNA polymerase and RNaseH to simultaneously degrade the RNA and synthesize second strand cDNA.     The first method (6 arrays total): cDNA was labeled using Encore Biotin Module (NuGEN Technologies Inc.). The second method (30 arrays total): cDNA was labeled using Affymetrix 3'IVT kit for cDNA synthesis and labeling. In Vitro Transcription to Synthesize Biotin-Modified aRNA with IVT Labeling Master Mix generates multiple copies of biotin-modified aRNA from the doublestranded cDNA templates.     Amplified and labeled cDNA (5 ug/sample) was fragmented and hybridized with rotation onto Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays for 16h at 45C. Arrays were washed on a Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) with the Hybridization Wash and Stain Kit (Affymetrix) and the Washing Procedure FS450_0004.     The MAS5 data was generated by using the Affymetrix Expression Console software. The console is a widely used standard software for Affymatrix arrays.     Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.5 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.5/Microarray/Affymetrix/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAffymetrix). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.4). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using oligo (version 1.58.0). Raw data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). The raw probe level intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the oligo (version 1.58.0) quantile method. Normalized probe level data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). Normalized probe level data was summarized to the probeset level using the oligo (version 1.58.0) RMA method. Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probeset using the Plants Ensembl database ftp server (plants.ensembl.org, release 54). Gene annotations were assigned for every probeset that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.At.tair.db (version 3.15.0).",

Two approaches were used; GFP reporter genes were used to collect gene expression data in real time within unique GFP imaging hardware, and plants were harvested on orbit to RNAlater for subsequent analyses of gene expression with using Affymetrix and SAGE transcriptome analyses. Three tissue types were examined (leaves, hypocotyls and roots) and compared to analyses conducted with whole plants. Transcriptome analyses with whole plants suggested that the spaceflight environment had little impact on the transcriptome of Arabidopsis, however, closer examination of selected tissues revealed that there are a number of tissue-specific responses that Arabidopsis employs to respond to this novel environment.",

General biology operations: Wild-type (non-transgenic) Arabidopsis plants and Arabidopsis tissue culture cells were planted on 60mm round, nutrient agar Petri plates cultured in a horizontal position until turnover and installation into the BRIC hardware. All of the sub-culturing on the plates was conducted in the laboratory of the PIs and the University of Florida. Some planting of the seeded plates was conducted at KSC. Plates were planted in a laminar flow hood and stored in sterile Biotransfer Boxes (BT). Plates with both seeds and cells were kept in the dark, and the seeds vernalized at 4 deg C.  Preparation of specialized plates and biology  Petri plates: Because of their configuration within the BRIC flight hardware, sterility was maintained on all surfaces (interior and exterior) of the Petri plates. The media in the plates for BRIC had to be 5mm deep or less to accommodate the biology and the PDFU cover hardware. For a 60mm dish, this calculates out to 6.7 mLs. After pouring, the plates are allowed to solidify, and then transferred to a sterile Biotransporter (to maintain sterility of external surface) until planting.   Preparation of seeded plates: Arabidopsis seed was surface sterilized working in a laminar flow hood. Seeds were planted on the surface of the Petri plates at a density of about 75 seeds per plate. The cover was replaced, but not taped, and transferred to a sterile BT. The BT was wrapped in black cloth and stored at 4 deg C until Turn Over.   Preparation of cell culture plates: The liquid media from a sterile cell suspension was decanted, and the cells were washed once with fresh liquid media, and then decanted again. A sterile scoop was used to place about 1 gram of cells in the surface on the plate and disperse evenly across the surface. The cover was replaced, but not taped, and transferred to a sterile BT. The BT was wrapped in black cloth and stored at room temperature until Turn Over.   BRIC Spaceflight Hardware: The hardware for this experiment was the NASA BRIC-LED (Biological Research In a Canister - Light Emitting Diode). The LED component of the hardware was disabled and all biology was held in the dark for the duration of the experiment. The BRIC-LED canisters hold six 60 mm diameter Petri plates in small sub-compartments called PDFUs (Petri Dish Fixation Units). The PDFUs allow an externally activated fixation step without manipulating the samples. We were allocated 13 PDFUs: 5 in BRIC A, 5 in BRIC B and 3 in BRIC G. The six replicate plates of seedlings and six replicate plates cultured cells (12 plates total) were distributed among three BRIC canisters. We were allocated 13 PDFUs: 5 in BRIC A, 5 in BRIC B and 3 in BRIC G. One of the PDFU slots in each BRIC was used to hold a HOBO data logger to record temperature. The HOBO temperature data collection begins immediately after the biology is sealed in the BRICs, 24 hours before launch. The BRICs were contained within a foam-lined tray for launch and stowage in a Shuttle Middeck Locker for the flight. An additional set of Petri plates within BRIC hardware, identical to that launched for Spaceflight, was prepared for the Ground Control. The Ground Control was housed in the OES (Orbital Environmental Simulator) chamber in the Spaceflight Life Sciences Laboratory (SLSL) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The Ground Control was initiated with a precise 24 hour delay to enable the OES environment to be programmed with the environmental profile taken from telemetry of the Space Shuttle. Nominally, the Ground Control BRIC hardware and samples experienced the same external environment profile as the hardware and samples on the Space Shuttle. Environmental parameters that are controlled on the OES and made identical to flight are cabin temperature, humidity and CO2 concentration.   Flight profile and environmental conditions: The BRIC-16 experiment was turned over to payload engineers in the SLSL at KSC 24 hours before the scheduled launch time. The payload launched on STS-131 on April 5th, 2010, at 06:25, and achieved orbit approximately eight minutes later.     The biology was in orbit 12 days and 21 hours (04/05/10 06:25:28 to 04/18/10 03:37:28) before being fixed on orbit with RNAlater. The orbiter landed on April 20th (04/20/10 07:37:28) and the biology was returned to the PIs at SLSL approximately 7 hours later.     The absorbed dose from ionizing radiation received by the flight specimens was estimated using TLD passive dosimeters located in the middeck of the space shuttle, where the payload was located. More specifically, we computed the average between three dosimeters (DLOC1, DLOC2, and DLOC3) for the mission and we divided it by the total duration of the mission to estimate the average absorbed dose rate in mGy/day. This dose rate did not include any shielding effects from the hardware where the specimens resided. The total absorbed dose in water was then computed by simply multiplying the average dose rate with the duration of the experiment. The duration of the experiment was defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”. Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. A table with these detailed computations for all space shuttle datasets is available on GeneLab at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.  The ground samples were not assessed for radiation exposure.",

          "Study Description": "We address a key baseline question of whether gene expression changes are induced by the orbital environment, and then we ask whether undifferentiated cells, cells presumably lacking the typical gravity response mechanisms, perceive spaceflight. Arabidopsis seedlings and undifferentiated cultured Arabidopsis cells were launched in April, 2010, as part of the BRIC-16 flight experiment on STS-131. Biologically replicated DNA microarray and averaged RNA digital transcript profiling revealed several hundred genes in seedlings and cell cultures that were significantly affected by launch and spaceflight. The response was moderate in seedlings; only a few genes were induced by more than 7-fold, and the overall intrinsic expression level for most differentially expressed genes was low. In contrast, cell cultures displayed a more dramatic response, with dozens of genes showing this level of differential expression, a list comprised primarily of heat shock-related and stress-related genes. This baseline transcriptome profiling of seedlings and cultured cells confirms the fundamental hypothesis that survival of the spaceflight environment requires adaptive changes that are both governed and displayed by alterations in gene expression. The comparison of intact plants with cultures of undifferentiated cells confirms a second hypothesis: undifferentiated cells can detect spaceflight in the absence of specialized tissue or organized developmental structures known to detect gravity.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia (Col-0) seeds were surface sterilized using 30% bleach and 0.1% Tween-20 for 2min. On each 60mm petri plate, 0.016g (800-900 seeds) of sterilized seeds were plated on 0.5x Murashige and Skoog media supplemented with 1% sucrose and 1% agar. All plates were cold stratified for 16 hours followed by 1 h of white light treatment to help synchronize germination. After the light treatment, 22 plates were placed inside individually sealed Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs); PDFUs were loaded into the Biological Research In Canister (BRIC) hardware which were kept under environmental control at the Kennedy Space Center. Another 22 plates were prepared identically at Ohio University, then wrapped in multiple layers of aluminum foil, and placed in opaque, air-tight plastic containers. Both sets were kept in cold storage for 4 days to simulate pre-launch conditions. The BRICs were then moved to room temperature to allow the seeds to germinate and grow for 76 hours to simulate duration of growth of the comparable spaceflight experiment.\n\nBRIC-PDFU (Petri Dish Fixation Unit): The BRIC-PDFU configuration allows biological specimens contained within 60 mm Petri dishes to be installed into polycarbonate blocks that are then installed into an aluminum box. The polycarbonate blocks (PDFUs) provide the ability to deliver both nutrient and fixative solutions to biological specimens housed in the Petri dishes. Important information can be gained through simple investigations in which organisms are taken to space, chemically fixed (or stabilized), and then returned for post-flight processing. The BRIC-PDFU is designed to accomplish this using a minimal amount (typically less than one hour) of astronaut crew time. Biological specimens are placed into the 60 mm Petri dishes containing agar-solidified media, although alternative approaches will be considered. Each Petri dish is then placed inside its own individually-sealed PDFU. The PDFUs are assembled and loaded with up to 17mL of either one or two fluids, such as a nutrient solution and/or a chemical fixative, in a reservoir compartment as specified by the selected investigators. Six PDFUs or five PDFUs plus one temperature data logger, depending on the investigator's requirements, are then loaded into each BRIC canister. No electrical power is provided to the BRIC-PDFU.     PDFUs were then actuated to allow immersion of tissues in approximately 6-7ml of RNAlater (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA) for 12 hours and then frozen at 80 C to simulate experimental conditions on the ISS. The experimental plates from the BRICs at Kennedy Space Center were packed in dry ice and transported to Ohio University in a temperature controlled vehicle. The control seedlings at Ohio University were also submerged in RNAlater for 12 hours in the dark and frozen at -80 C. After receipt of the samples from Kennedy Space Center, both experimental and control samples were thawed prior to RNA and protein extraction.     For extraction of soluble and membrane proteins, seedlings from five plates, fixed with RNAlater, were pooled for each of the 3 replicates. Seedlings were crushed with liquid nitrogen, placed in the extraction buffer (250mM sucrose (Fisher Chemical, Fair Lawn, NJ), 2mM EGTA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 10% (v/v) glycerol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 0.5% BSA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 50mM Bis Tris Propane (BTP)2-(N-morpholine)-ethanesulfonic acid (MES) (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH), pH 7.8, 0.25M KI (J.T. Baker Chemical Co., Phillipsburg, NJ), 2mM DTT (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (G Biosciences, St. Louis, MO) and 5mM -ME (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH)) and vortexed thoroughly. The sample was then centrifuged at 100,000g to isolate the membrane proteins which formed a pellet. The supernatant was saved and used for the extraction of soluble proteins. The protocol is detailed in Basu et al. (2015). The collected protein extracts were sent to the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, St. Louis, MO, for protein identification and quantification as described in Kruse et al. (2017). Overall, equal amounts (40g) of both membrane and soluble proteins, three replicates each, were digested with trypsin and labeled with a unique iTRAQ 8-plex reagent (AB SCIEX, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol (AB SCIEX, Foster City, CA). Replicates for each sample were then pooled and dried. The pooled samples were reconstituted in 0.5% TFA, desalted by solid-phase extraction and dried. 100g of each sample was fractionated using high pH reverse phase chromatography. The fractions were combined into 12 final fractions for LC-MS MS.     Proteins were labeled with a unique ITRAQ 8-plex reagent, according to the manufacturer's protocol (AB SCIEX, Foster City, CA). iTRAQ reagents allow for simultaneous quantification and identification of proteins upon liquid chromatography-MS MS. The N-hydroxysuccinimide group in the iTRAQ label is amine reactive and reacts with the -amine group of lysine residues and amine groups of the N-terminus of the peptides, thereby attaching the labels to the peptides (Rauniyar and Yates, 2014).     LC-MS MS was performed on a LTQ-Orbitrap Velos Pro mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) coupled with a U3000 RSLCnano HPLC (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Each pooled fraction was redissolved in 15 L 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, and 5 L of each loaded per injection, onto a C18 trap column (PepMap100, 300 mID x 5mm, 5m particle size; ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) at a flow rate of 5 L/min for 3.5 min with 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. Peptide separation was then carried out on a C18 column (nanoAcquity CSH130, 25 cm x 75 m, C18, 1.7 m, Waters, Milford, MA) at a flow rate of 0.26 L/min. Peptides were separated using the following gradient (mobile phase A, 0.1% formic acid; mobile phase B, 0.1% formic acid in 80:20 acetonitrile:water).     Plant material from three plates, one per replicate, was used for RNAseq analysis. RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Plant Mini Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) per standard protocols. RNA integrity (RIN) was verified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The extracted RNA was sent to the Genome Technology Access Center in the Department of Genetics at Washington University, St. Louis. Samples were processed using the Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit prior to library preparation and sequencing.     Illumina library; stranded; paired end; 150-300bp fragment size selection.     Illumina HiSeq 2500; 2x101 bp read length, three technical replicates     Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Arabidopsis thaliana STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 44, genome version TAIR10 (Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.toplevel.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.44.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis thaliana STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads from 3 samples were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.0.3) with tximport (version 1.18.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.30.0). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.30.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.2.0), PANTHER.db (v1.0.10), and org.At.tair.db (v3.12.0).",

          "Study Description": "On Earth plants are constantly exposed to a gravitational field of 1G. Gravity affects a plant in every step of its development. Germinating seedlings orient their radicle and hypocotyl and growing plants position organs at a specific Gravitropic Set-point Angle dictated by the asymmetric distribution of auxin depending on the gravity vector. Hence gravitropism is one of the fundamental growth responses in plants. For any experiment studying the effects of gravity on plants, the ultimate control is the microgravity in space. In this study, Arabidopsis seeds were flown to the International Space Station and allowed to germinate and grow for 3 days in microgravity. Arabidopsis Wild Type Col-0 seeds were plated onto twenty-two 60mm Petri plates, loaded into PDFUs and inserted 4 Biological Research in Canisters (BRICs). Approximately 800 seeds were sterilized, plated on each 60mm Petri plates and cold stratified for 16 hours followed by 2 hours of white light treatment. The BRICs were maintained at 4C until spaceflight to ensure seed germination in microgravity. After 3 days of germination and growth, the seedlings were fixed by injecting RNAlater into the chamber. They were kept at ambient temperature for 12 hours followed by freezing at -80C. An additional 22 plates were used as ground controls. After the spaceflight, tissue from five plates was pooled to make each of three replicates. Both membrane and soluble proteins were extracted from the pooled seedlings. Proteins were trypsin digested, labelled with iTRAQ and identified using tandem mass spectrometry.",

          "Study Protocol Description": "The data presented here are from plants harvested during one of several experiments launched to the ISS on STS-129, November 16, 2009 (specifically, Run 1B: 12/3/2009–12/15/2009), and returned on STS-130, February 8, 2010. Arabidopsis seeds were planted aseptically on the surface of 10 cm2 solid media plates. The samples come from a collection of three Arabidopsis lines. The three GFP [green fluorescent protein] reporter gene lines were Adh::GFP [alcohol dehydrogenase promoter]; DR5r::GFP [synthetic auxin response element composed of five AuxRE elements; gift of T. Guilfoyle]; and 35s::GFP [driven by the CaMV35s promoter]. Seeds and seeded plates were prepared in such a way as to maintain dormancy in light-tight coverings until the initiation of the experiment on orbit. The plated seeds remained dormant until activated by exposure to light on the ISS, which initiated germination. Both the flight plates and ground control plates were grown in the Advanced Biological Research System, ABRS. The ABRS provided temperature control, light control, and circulation of air that was scrubbed to remove volatile organic compounds. On orbit, the dormant seeded plates were unwrapped from their coverings and installed in the GFP Imaging System (GIS), which was then inserted into the ABRS. The GIS held the plates within the ABRS, facilitated access by the astronaut on orbit, and provided regular imaging. After growth, all plates were photographed by the crew, along with the comparable GIS/ABRS-grown ground control.\n\nThe ground control plates were similarly housed in the GIS of an ABRS in the Orbital Environmental Simulator chamber in the Spaceflight Life Sciences Laboratory at Kennedy Space Center following a similar, but delayed, timeline as the plates on the ISS, with the use of environmental data such as temperature, relative humidity, light levels, and CO2 concentrations as was experienced by the plants on orbit. The ground control samples received the same physical processing steps of harvest, freezing, thawing, and distribution in the laboratory as did the spaceflight samples.     The 12-day-old plants recovered from the frozen KFTs of both flight and ground control plants were thawed then dissected into roots, hypocotyls, and leaves, similar to the dissections performed by Paul et al. (2013). Approximately half the root material from 6-7 seedlings within a single Petri plate constituted each of three biological replicates for analysis of root proteins.     For each replicate, 80mg of RNAlater-fixed Arabidopsis root material was blotted with tissue to remove excess RNAlater and then ground in a liquid nitrogen-chilled pestle and mortar with 400?L protein extraction buffer per sample [100mM sodium phosphate (pH 7), 2mM EDTA, 25mM NaF, 5mM MgCl2, 150mM NaCl, 0.1% triton-X100, 10% glycerol, 1mM dithiothreitol], commercial cocktails of protease (Set VI, Calbiochem) and phosphatase (Set I, Calbiochem) inhibitors. Samples were ground until completely homogeneous and then centrifuged at 13,000rpm for 10min at 4C. The supernatant containing buffer-soluble proteins was collected, and proteins were purified as described by Koh et al. (2012). The leaf sample from flight and ground control plants was similarly prepared from half the material of a single Petri plate, constituting the leaves from seven plants. Protein assays were performed to quantify purified proteins by using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) with the SoftMax Pro Software v5.3 (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA, USA) under the SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices).     For each sample (three replicate root samples and the single leaf sample for the flight and ground controls), 16?g of the recovered proteins were reduced, alkylated, trypsin-digested, and labeled according to the manufacturer's instructions (AB Sciex Inc.). The three biological replicates of ground root samples were labeled with iTRAQ tags 113, 114, and 115, and those of flight root samples were labeled with 116, 117, and 118, respectively. The ground shoot sample was labeled with iTRAQ tag 119, while the flight shoot was labeled with 121. The combined labeled peptide mixtures were desalted with C18-solid phase extraction and dissolved in strong cation exchange solvent A [25% (v/v) acetonitrile, 10mM ammonium formate, and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (pH 2.8)]. The peptides were fractionated by an Agilent HPLC system 1260 with a polysulfoethyl A column (2.1*100mm, 5?m, 300 A; PolyLC, Columbia, MD, USA) with a flow rate of 200?L/min. Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 0-20% solvent B [25% (v/v) acetonitrile and 500mM ammonium formate (pH 6.8)] over 50min followed by ramping up to 100% solvent B in 5min. Fourteen fractions were collected by monitoring the absorbance at 280nm and lyophilized.     A quadrupole-time-of-flight LTQ Orbitrap XL MS/MS system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) was used for data acquisition as described previously (Makarov et al., 2006). It was interfaced with an Eksigent nano-LC AS2 system (Eksigent Technologies, Dublin, CA, USA) using high-energy collision dissociation. Each fraction was loaded onto an Agilent Zorbax 300SB-C18 trap column (0.3mm i.d.*5mm length, 5?m particle size) with a flow rate of 5?L/min for 10min. Reversed-phase C18 chromatographic separation of peptides was carried out on a pre-packed BetaBasic C18 PicoFrit column (75?m i.d.*10cm length, New Objective, Woburn, MA, USA) at 300nL/min with the following gradient: 5% B for 1min as an equilibration status; 60% B for 99min as a gradient; 90% B for 5min as a washing status; 5% B for 10min as an equilibration status (solvent A: 0.1% formic acid in 97% water, 3% acetonitrile; solvent B: 0.1% formic acid in 97% acetonitrile, 3% water).     The MS/MS data were processed by a thorough search considering biological modification and amino acid substitution against the non-redundant uniprot Arabidopsis thaliana database (53,270 entries downloaded on June 14, 2014, at http://beta.uniprot.org) by using the Fraglet and Taglet searches under the Paragon algorithm (Shilov et al., 2007) of ProteinPilot v.4.5 software (AB Sciex, Inc.) and Sequest search (Eng et al., 1994) under Proteome Discoverer v.1.4 software (Thermo Scientific, Inc.). Mascot searches (Perkins et al., 1999) under Mascot Daemon (Matrix Science, Boston, MA, USA) were conducted with the following parameters: trypsin digestion allowing for up to two missed cleavages, methionine oxidation and iTRAQ on N-termini and lysines, iTRAQ 8-plex quantification, 10 ppm tolerance for MS and MS/MS, peptide charges of +1, +2, and +3, and monoisotopic masses. Plant protein, cysteine modification with methyl methanethiosulfate, fixed iTRAQ modification of free amine in the N-terminus and lysine, and variable iTRAQ modifications of tyrosine were considered. ProteoIQ2.7 (PREMIER Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used to cluster peptides to proteins (protein groups) and output lists of proteins having a minimum peptide probability of >0.95 and a minimum protein probability of <0.95 from all search results for final identification at a 5% false discovery rate (FDR; for comparison of FDRs, see Supplementary Fig. S2) (Tang et al., 2008). Systematic bias was corrected from non-redundant spectrum per peptide from all three search algorithms by using intensity normalization of protein quantification across samples by ProteoIQ2.7 (PREMIER Biosoft). Protein relative quantification was performed by using the ratios from tandem mass spectra when the peptides were uniquely assigned to detected protein. To be identified as being significantly differentially expressed, a protein had to be quantified with at least three peptides in experimental replicates, a p value <0.05, and a fold change >1.2 or <0.8 as determined with a Fisher's combined probability of <0.05 (Fisher, 1948). For identified proteins, the functional annotation was assigned to identified protein sequences by Blast2GO suite (Conesa et al., 2005) (http://www.blast2go.com/b2ghome) and confirmed with the Arabidopsis functional catalog (Bevan et al., 1998). In addition, we used parametric analysis of gene set enrichment (PAGE) of the agriGO tool (http://bioinfo.cau.edu.cn/agriGO) to determine specifically enriched biological processes.",
